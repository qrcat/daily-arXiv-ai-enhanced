Webpage and additional\n  videos at https://montrealrobotics.ca/perpetua/", "summary": "Many robotic systems require extended deployments in complex, dynamic\nenvironments. In such deployments, parts of the environment may change between\nsubsequent robot observations. Most robotic mapping or environment modeling\nalgorithms are incapable of representing dynamic features in a way that enables\npredicting their future state. Instead, they opt to filter certain state\nobservations, either by removing them or some form of weighted averaging. This\npaper introduces Perpetua, a method for modeling the dynamics of semi-static\nfeatures. Perpetua is able to: incorporate prior knowledge about the dynamics\nof the feature if it exists, track multiple hypotheses, and adapt over time to\nenable predicting of future feature states. Specifically, we chain together\nmixtures of \"persistence\" and \"emergence\" filters to model the probability that\nfeatures will disappear or reappear in a formal Bayesian framework. The\napproach is an efficient, scalable, general, and robust method for estimating\nthe states of features in an environment, both in the present as well as at\narbitrary future times. Through experiments on simulated and real-world data,\nwe find that Perpetua yields better accuracy than similar approaches while also\nbeing online adaptable and robust to missing observations."}

Reinforcement\nlearning (RL), a prominent method in end-to-end driving, enables agents to\nlearn through trial and error in simulation. However, RL training often relies\non rule-based traffic scenarios, limiting generalization. Additionally, current\nscenario generation methods focus heavily on critical scenarios, neglecting a\nbalance with routine driving behaviors. Curriculum learning, which\nprogressively trains agents on increasingly complex tasks, is a promising\napproach to improving the robustness and coverage of RL driving policies.\nHowever, existing research mainly emphasizes manually designed curricula,\nfocusing on scenery and actor placement rather than traffic behavior dynamics.\nThis work introduces a novel student-teacher framework for automatic curriculum\nlearning. The teacher, a graph-based multi-agent RL component, adaptively\ngenerates traffic behaviors across diverse difficulty levels. An adaptive\nmechanism adjusts task difficulty based on student performance, ensuring\nexposure to behaviors ranging from common to critical. The student, though\nexchangeable, is realized as a deep RL agent with partial observability,\nreflecting real-world perception constraints.

However, since floorplans\nare minimalist representations of a building's structure, modal and geometric\ndifferences between visual perceptions and floorplans pose challenges to this\ntask. While existing methods cleverly utilize 2D geometric features and pose\nfilters to achieve promising performance, they fail to address the localization\nerrors caused by frequent visual changes and view occlusions due to variously\nshaped 3D objects. To tackle these issues, this paper views the 2D Floorplan\nLocalization (FLoc) problem from a higher dimension by injecting 3D geometric\npriors into the visual FLoc algorithm. For the 3D geometric prior modeling, we\nfirst model geometrically aware view invariance using multi-view constraints,\ni.e., leveraging imaging geometric principles to provide matching constraints\nbetween multiple images that see the same points.

For the 3D geometric prior modeling, we\nfirst model geometrically aware view invariance using multi-view constraints,\ni.e., leveraging imaging geometric principles to provide matching constraints\nbetween multiple images that see the same points.

However, existing VOS models often struggle with\nprecise mask delineation, deformable objects, topologically transforming\nobjects, tracking drift and long video sequences. In this paper, we introduce\nHQ-SMem, for High Quality video segmentation and tracking using Smart Memory, a\nnovel method that enhances the performance of VOS base models by addressing\nthese limitations. Our approach incorporates three key innovations: (i)\nleveraging SAM with High-Quality masks (SAM-HQ) alongside appearance-based\ncandidate-selection to refine coarse segmentation masks, resulting in improved\nobject boundaries; (ii) implementing a dynamic smart memory mechanism that\nselectively stores relevant key frames while discarding redundant ones, thereby\noptimizing memory usage and processing efficiency for long-term videos; and\n(iii) dynamically updating the appearance model to effectively handle complex\ntopological object variations and reduce drift throughout the video. These\ncontributions mitigate several limitations of existing VOS models including,\ncoarse segmentations that mix-in background pixels, fixed memory update\nschedules, brittleness to drift and occlusions, and prompt ambiguity issues\nassociated with SAM. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple public\ndatasets and state-of-the-art base trackers demonstrate that our method\nconsistently ranks among the top two on VOTS and VOTSt 2024 datasets. Moreover,\nHQ-SMem sets new benchmarks on Long Video Dataset and LVOS, showcasing its\neffectiveness in challenging scenarios characterized by complex multi-object\ndynamics over extended temporal durations."}

Our results reveal a fundamental\ntrade-off between model complexity and generalization: a higher-capacity\nattention-based model excelled on ID data, but a simpler linear model was more\nrobust, outperforming a competitive baseline by 18\\% on the OOD set.\nIntriguingly, we found that linguistic features did not improve predictive\naccuracy, suggesting that for familiar languages, neural encoding may be\ndominated by the continuous visual and auditory streams over redundant textual\ninformation. Spatially, our approach showed marked performance gains in the\nauditory cortex, underscoring the benefit of high-fidelity speech\nrepresentations. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that rigorous OOD\ntesting is essential for building robust neuro-AI models and provides nuanced\ninsights into how model architecture, stimulus characteristics, and sensory\nhierarchies shape the neural encoding of our rich, multimodal world."}

The new model assumes that\nthe feature function of a mesh can be approximated by the sum of piecewise\nconstant function and asmooth function, and the rTGV regularization is able to\ncharacterize the high order discontinuity of the geometric structure. The newly\nintroduced method is effective in segmenting meshes with irregular structures\nand getting the better boundaries rather than the shortest boundaries. We solve\nthe new model by alternating minimization and alternating direction method of\nmultipliers (ADMM). Our algorithm is discussed from several aspects, and\ncomparisons with several state-of-art methods. Experimental results show that\nour method can yield competitive results when compared to other approaches. In\naddition, our results compare favorably to those of the several state-of-art\ntechniques when evaluated on the Princeton Segmentation Benchmark. Furthermore,\nthe quantitative errors and computational costs confirm the robustness and\nefficiency of the proposed method."}
