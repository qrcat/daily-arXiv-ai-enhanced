In such deployments, parts of the environment may change between\nsubsequent robot observations. Most robotic mapping or environment modeling\nalgorithms are incapable of representing dynamic features in a way that enables\npredicting their future state. Instead, they opt to filter certain state\nobservations, either by removing them or some form of weighted averaging. This\npaper introduces Perpetua, a method for modeling the dynamics of semi-static\nfeatures. Perpetua is able to: incorporate prior knowledge about the dynamics\nof the feature if it exists, track multiple hypotheses, and adapt over time to\nenable predicting of future feature states. Specifically, we chain together\nmixtures of \"persistence\" and \"emergence\" filters to model the probability that\nfeatures will disappear or reappear in a formal Bayesian framework. The\napproach is an efficient, scalable, general, and robust method for estimating\nthe states of features in an environment, both in the present as well as at\narbitrary future times.

Our model employs a tri-plane volumetric feature representation --\ni.e., the projection of 3D features onto three canonical planes. We introduce a\nnovel tri-plane feature design in which features on the horizontal plane are\nequivariant to 90{\\deg} rotations, while the sum of features from the other two\nplanes remains invariant to the same transformations. This design is enabled by\na new deformable steerable convolution, which combines the adaptability of\ndeformable convolutions with the rotational equivariance of steerable ones.\nThis allows the receptive field to adapt to local object geometry while\npreserving equivariance properties. We further develop equivariant adaptations\nof two state-of-the-art volumetric grasp planners, GIGA and IGD. Specifically,\nwe derive a new equivariant formulation of IGD's deformable attention mechanism\nand propose an equivariant generative model of grasp orientations based on flow\nmatching. We provide a detailed analytical justification of the proposed\nequivariance properties and validate our approach through extensive simulated\nand real-world experiments. Our results demonstrate that the proposed\nprojection-based design significantly reduces both computational and memory\ncosts.

Time series capture the behavior of many\nlarge-scale real-world processes, from stock market trends to urban activities.\nUsers often gain insights by visualizing them as line charts, juxtaposing or\nsuperposing multiple time series to compare them and identify trends and\npatterns. However, existing representations struggle with scalability: when\ncovering long time spans, leading to visual clutter from too many small\nmultiples or overlapping lines. We propose TiVy, a new algorithm that\nsummarizes time series using sequential patterns. It transforms the series into\na set of symbolic sequences based on subsequence visual similarity using\nDynamic Time Warping (DTW), then constructs a disjoint grouping of similar\nsubsequences based on the frequent sequential patterns. The grouping result, a\nvisual summary of time series, provides uncluttered superposition with fewer\nsmall multiples. Unlike common clustering techniques, TiVy extracts similar\nsubsequences (of varying lengths) aligned in time. We also present an\ninteractive time series visualization that renders large-scale time series in\nreal-time. Our experimental evaluation shows that our algorithm (1) extracts\nclear and accurate patterns when visualizing time series data, (2) achieves a\nsignificant speed-up (1000X) compared to a straightforward DTW clustering.

Critical to ML-ADAS is the\ncollision avoidance feature, which requires the ability to detect objects and\nestimate their distances accurately. This is achieved with specialized DNNs\nlike YOLO, which provides real-time object detection, and a lightweight,\ndetection-wise distance estimation approach that relies on key features\nextracted from the detections like bounding box dimensions and size.

In practice, when humans attempt to\npredict the next location in a trajectory, they often visualize the trajectory\non a map and reason based on road connectivity and movement trends. However,\nthe vast majority of existing next-location prediction models do not reason\nover maps \\textbf{in the way that humans do}. Fortunately, the recent\ndevelopment of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has demonstrated strong\ncapabilities in visual perception and even visual reasoning. This opens up a\nnew possibility: by rendering both the road network and trajectory onto an\nimage and leveraging the reasoning abilities of VLMs, we can enable models to\nperform trajectory inference in a human-like manner. To explore this idea, we\nfirst propose a method called Vision-Guided Location Search (VGLS), which\nevaluates whether a general-purpose VLM is capable of trajectory-based\nreasoning without modifying any of its internal parameters. Based on insights\nfrom the VGLS results, we further propose our main approach: VLMLocPredictor,\nwhich is composed of two stages: In the first stage, we design two Supervised\nFine-Tuning (SFT) tasks that help the VLM understand road network and\ntrajectory structures and acquire basic reasoning ability on such visual\ninputs. In the second stage, we introduce Reinforcement Learning from Visual\nMap Feedback, enabling the model to self-improve its next-location prediction\nability through interaction with the environment.

While traditional\nmodels like CNNs and RNNs have achieved moderate success, they often struggle\nto generalize across diverse and complex actions. Recent advancements in\nvision-language models, especially the transformer-based CLIP model, offer\npromising capabilities for generalizing action recognition from video data. In\nthis work, we evaluate CLIP on the UCF-101 dataset and systematically analyze\nits performance under three masking strategies: (1) percentage-based and\nshape-based black masking at 10%, 30%, and 50%, (2) feature-specific masking to\nsuppress bias-inducing elements, and (3) isolation masking that retains only\nclass-specific regions. Our results reveal that CLIP exhibits inconsistent\nbehavior and frequent misclassifications, particularly when essential visual\ncues are obscured. To overcome these limitations, we propose incorporating\nclass-specific noise, learned via a custom loss function, to reinforce\nattention to class-defining features.

However, estimating the unloaded geometry from clinical\nimages remains a challenging task.

Recent works have addressed the problem by representing the\nentire non-obstacle road regions as the free-space. In contrast our aim is to\nestimate the driving corridors that are a navigable subset of the entire road\nregion. Unfortunately, existing corridor estimation methods directly assume a\nBEV-centric representation, which is hard to obtain. In contrast, we frame\ndrivable free-space corridor prediction as a pure image perception task, using\nonly monocular camera input. However such a formulation poses several\nchallenges as one doesn't have the corresponding data for such free-space\ncorridor segments in the image. Consequently, we develop a novel\nself-supervised approach for free-space sample generation by leveraging future\nego trajectories and front-view camera images, making the process of visual\ncorridor estimation dependent on the ego trajectory. We then employ a diffusion\nprocess to model the distribution of such segments in the image.

However, since floorplans\nare minimalist representations of a building's structure, modal and geometric\ndifferences between visual perceptions and floorplans pose challenges to this\ntask. While existing methods cleverly utilize 2D geometric features and pose\nfilters to achieve promising performance, they fail to address the localization\nerrors caused by frequent visual changes and view occlusions due to variously\nshaped 3D objects. To tackle these issues, this paper views the 2D Floorplan\nLocalization (FLoc) problem from a higher dimension by injecting 3D geometric\npriors into the visual FLoc algorithm. For the 3D geometric prior modeling, we\nfirst model geometrically aware view invariance using multi-view constraints,\ni.e., leveraging imaging geometric principles to provide matching constraints\nbetween multiple images that see the same points. Then, we further model the\nview-scene aligned geometric priors, enhancing the cross-modal geometry-color\ncorrespondences by associating the scene's surface reconstruction with the RGB\nframes of the sequence. Both 3D priors are modeled through self-supervised\ncontrastive learning, thus no additional geometric or semantic annotations are\nrequired. These 3D priors summarized in extensive realistic scenes bridge the\nmodal gap while improving localization success without increasing the\ncomputational burden on the FLoc algorithm. Sufficient comparative studies\ndemonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods\nand substantially boosts the FLoc accuracy.

To verify the effectiveness of the SAR-TEXT\ndataset, we conduct experiments on three typical vision-language tasks:\nimage-text retrieval, image captioning, and visual question answering (VQA).\nSpecifically, we construct three representative models on SAR-TEXT:\nSAR-RS-CLIP, SAR-RS-CoCa, and SAR-GPT.

Based on this structure, we further propose the intra-node\noperation to aggregate various Gaussians connected to one mesh vertex, and\ninter-node operation to support message passing among mesh node neighbors.\nExperimental results on novel view synthesis and novel pose animation\ndemonstrate the efficiency and generalization of our method.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u53cc\u5c42\u6b21\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08Human Gaussian Graph\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u5efa\u6a21\u53ef\u52a8\u753b\u5316\u7684\u4eba\u4f53\u5316\u8eab\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u65f6\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u751f\u62103D\u9ad8\u65af\u65f6\u672a\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u95f4\u5e27\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5efa\u6a21\u53ef\u52a8\u753b\u5316\u7684\u4eba\u4f53\u5316\u8eab\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53cc\u5c42\u6b21\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\uff08Human Gaussian Graph\uff09\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e00\u5c42\u4e3a\u9ad8\u65af\u8282\u70b9\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u5c42\u4e3aSMPL\u7f51\u683c\u9876\u70b9\u8282\u70b9\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5c42\u5185\u548c\u5c42\u95f4\u64cd\u4f5c\u805a\u5408\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u5408\u6210\u548c\u65b0\u59ff\u52bf\u52a8\u753b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "Human Gaussian Graph\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u6a21\u9ad8\u65af\u4e0e\u7f51\u683c\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u53ef\u52a8\u753b\u5316\u4eba\u4f53\u5316\u8eab\u5efa\u6a21\u3002"}}

In this paper, we introduce\nHQ-SMem, for High Quality video segmentation and tracking using Smart Memory, a\nnovel method that enhances the performance of VOS base models by addressing\nthese limitations. Our approach incorporates three key innovations: (i)\nleveraging SAM with High-Quality masks (SAM-HQ) alongside appearance-based\ncandidate-selection to refine coarse segmentation masks, resulting in improved\nobject boundaries; (ii) implementing a dynamic smart memory mechanism that\nselectively stores relevant key frames while discarding redundant ones, thereby\noptimizing memory usage and processing efficiency for long-term videos; and\n(iii) dynamically updating the appearance model to effectively handle complex\ntopological object variations and reduce drift throughout the video. These\ncontributions mitigate several limitations of existing VOS models including,\ncoarse segmentations that mix-in background pixels, fixed memory update\nschedules, brittleness to drift and occlusions, and prompt ambiguity issues\nassociated with SAM.

To address this, we propose a novel\nmulti-granularity hierarchical fusion transformer (MGHFT), with a multi-view\nsticker interpreter based on Multimodal Large Language Models. Specifically,\ninspired by the human ability to interpret sticker emotions from multiple\nviews, we first use Multimodal Large Language Models to interpret stickers by\nproviding rich textual context via multi-view descriptions. Then, we design a\nhierarchical fusion strategy to fuse the textual context into visual\nunderstanding, which builds upon a pyramid visual transformer to extract both\nglobal and local sticker features at multiple stages. Through contrastive\nlearning and attention mechanisms, textual features are injected at different\nstages of the visual backbone, enhancing the fusion of global- and\nlocal-granularity visual semantics with textual guidance. Finally, we introduce\na text-guided fusion attention mechanism to effectively integrate the overall\nmultimodal features, enhancing semantic understanding. Extensive experiments on\n2 public sticker emotion datasets demonstrate that MGHFT significantly\noutperforms existing sticker emotion recognition approaches, achieving higher\naccuracy and more fine-grained emotion recognition. Compared to the best\npre-trained visual models, our MGHFT also obtains an obvious improvement, 5.4%\non F1 and 4.0% on accuracy.

This study\nevaluates the effectiveness of three state-of-the-art deep learning approaches\nYOLO-v11, YOLO-World, and YOLO-Classification on a real-world vehicle image\ndataset. This dataset was collected under challenging and unconstrained\nconditions by NSW Police Highway Patrol Vehicles. A multi-view inference (MVI)\napproach was deployed to enhance the performance of the models' predictions. To\nconduct the analyses, datasets with 100,000 plus images were created for each\nof the three metadata prediction tasks, specifically make, shape and colour.\nThe models were tested on a separate dataset with 29,937 images belonging to\n1809 number plates. Different sets of experiments have been investigated by\nvarying the models sizes. A classification accuracy of 93.70%, 82.86%, 85.19%,\nand 94.86% was achieved with the best performing make, shape, colour, and\ncolour-binary models respectively. It was concluded that there is a need to use\nMVI to get usable models within such complex real-world datasets. Our findings\nindicated that the object detection models YOLO-v11 and YOLO-World outperformed\nclassification-only models in make and shape extraction.

To this end, existing methods focus on enhancing point\ncloud quality by developing dedicated denoising and completion models. However,\ndue to the isolation between the point cloud enhancement and downstream tasks,\nthese methods fail to work in various real-world domains. In addition, the\nconflicting objectives between denoising and completing tasks further limit the\nensemble paradigm to preserve critical geometric features. To tackle the above\nchallenges, we propose a unified point-level prompting method that reformulates\npoint cloud denoising and completion as a prompting mechanism, enabling robust\nanalysis in a parameter-efficient manner.

Despite the impressive transferability of VLMs through large-scale\ntraining, they suffer from a critical limitation that fails to handle negation.\nTo address this challenge, existing methods attribute its root cause to the\nscarcity of negation training data and propose to fine-tune VLMs on massive\ndata containing explicit negation.

Methods: In this study, a self-training framework is\nproposed by leveraging a teacher-student model for the segmentation of\npulmonary vessels. First, the high-quality annotations are acquired in the\nin-house data by an interactive way. Then, the model is trained in the\nsemi-supervised way. A fully supervised model is trained on a small set of\nlabeled CT images, yielding the teacher model. Following this, the teacher\nmodel is used to generate pseudo-labels for the unlabeled CT images, from which\nreliable ones are selected based on a certain strategy. The training of the\nstudent model involves these reliable pseudo-labels. This training process is\niteratively repeated until an optimal performance is achieved.

While existing point-based and grid-based methods expose two key\nlimitations: insufficiently modeling human motion dynamics, as they fail to\nbalance local motion details with long-range spatiotemporal dependencies, and\nthe time representation lacks interaction with the frequency domain in modeling\ntrajectory sequences. To address these challenges, we propose PatchTraj, a\ndynamic patch-based trajectory prediction framework that unifies time-domain\nand frequency-domain representations. Specifically, we decompose the trajectory\ninto raw time sequences and frequency components, employing dynamic patch\npartitioning for multi-scale trajectory segmentation to capture hierarchical\nmotion patterns. Each patch is processed by an adaptive embedding layer with\nscale-aware feature extraction, followed by hierarchical feature aggregation to\nmodel both fine-grained and long-range dependencies.

While generative models offer a promising solution for\ndata synthesis, current approaches often fail to adequately emphasize\nlesion-specific features and their relationships with surrounding tissues. In\nthis paper, we propose Gated Conditional Diffusion Model (GCDM), a novel\nframework designed to jointly synthesize holistic mammogram images and\nlocalized lesions. GCDM is built upon a latent denoising diffusion framework,\nwhere the noised latent image is concatenated with a soft mask embedding that\nrepresents breast, lesion, and their transitional regions, ensuring anatomical\ncoherence between them during the denoising process. To further emphasize\nlesion-specific features, GCDM incorporates a gated conditioning branch that\nguides the denoising process by dynamically selecting and fusing the most\nrelevant radiomic and geometric properties of lesions, effectively capturing\ntheir interplay. Experimental results demonstrate that GCDM achieves precise\ncontrol over small lesion areas while enhancing the realism and diversity of\nsynthesized mammograms. These advancements position GCDM as a promising tool\nfor clinical applications in mammogram synthesis.

However, identifying\n3D depth anomalies using only 2D information is insufficient. Despite\nexplicitly fusing depth information into RGB images or using point cloud\nbackbone networks to extract depth features, both approaches struggle to\nadequately represent 3D information in multimodal scenarios due to the\ndisparities among different modal information. Additionally, due to the\nscarcity of abnormal samples in industrial data, especially in multimodal\nscenarios, it is necessary to perform anomaly generation to simulate real-world\nabnormal samples. Therefore, we propose a novel unified multimodal anomaly\ndetection framework to address these issues. Our contributions consist of 3 key\naspects. (1) We extract visible depth information from 3D point cloud data\nsimply and use 2D RGB images to represent appearance, which disentangles depth\nand appearance to support unified anomaly generation. (2) Benefiting from the\nflexible input representation, the proposed Multi-Scale Gaussian Anomaly\nGenerator and Unified Texture Anomaly Generator can generate richer anomalies\nin RGB and depth. (3) All modules share parameters for both RGB and depth data,\neffectively bridging 2D and 3D anomaly detection. Subsequent modules can\ndirectly leverage features from both modalities without complex fusion.\nExperiments show our method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) on MVTec-3D AD\nand Eyecandies datasets.

Through the lens of these circuits, we\ndiscover that visual semantics are highly localized to specific object\ntokens--removing these tokens can degrade model performance by up to 92.6%.\nFurthermore, we identify that interpretable concepts of objects and actions\nemerge and become progressively refined in the middle-to-late layers of LVLMs.\nIn contrary to the current works that solely focus on objects in one image, we\nreveal that the middle-to-late layers of LVLMs exhibit specialized functional\nlocalization for spatiotemporal semantics. Our findings offer significant\nmechanistic insights into spatiotemporal semantics analysis of LVLMs, laying a\nfoundation for designing more robust and interpretable models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7535\u8def\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LVLMs\uff09\u4e2d\u65f6\u7a7a\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u548c\u5904\u7406\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u4e49\u9ad8\u5ea6\u96c6\u4e2d\u4e8e\u7279\u5b9a\u5bf9\u8c61\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u4e14\u4e2d\u665a\u671f\u5c42\u5bf9\u65f6\u7a7a\u8bed\u4e49\u6709\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3002", "motivation": "\u76ee\u524d\u5bf9LVLMs\u4e2d\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u5904\u7406\u673a\u5236\u5df2\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4f46\u65f6\u7a7a\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u63a8\u7406\u673a\u5236\u4ecd\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e09\u4e2a\u7535\u8def\uff1a\u89c6\u89c9\u5ba1\u8ba1\u7535\u8def\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u8ffd\u8e2a\u7535\u8def\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6d41\u7535\u8def\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u6790LVLMs\u4e2d\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u8bed\u4e49\u5904\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u4e49\u9ad8\u5ea6\u96c6\u4e2d\u4e8e\u7279\u5b9a\u5bf9\u8c61\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u79fb\u9664\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6807\u8bb0\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u9ad8\u8fbe92.6%\uff1b\u4e2d\u665a\u671f\u5c42\u5bf9\u5bf9\u8c61\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6982\u5ff5\u9010\u6b65\u7ec6\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86LVLMs\u4e2d\u65f6\u7a7a\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Project Page: https://gs-occ3d.github.io/", "summary": "Occupancy is crucial for autonomous driving, providing essential geometric\npriors for perception and planning. However, existing methods predominantly\nrely on LiDAR-based occupancy annotations, which limits scalability and\nprevents leveraging vast amounts of potential crowdsourced data for\nauto-labeling. To address this, we propose GS-Occ3D, a scalable vision-only\nframework that directly reconstructs occupancy. Vision-only occupancy\nreconstruction poses significant challenges due to sparse viewpoints, dynamic\nscene elements, severe occlusions, and long-horizon motion. Existing\nvision-based methods primarily rely on mesh representation, which suffer from\nincomplete geometry and additional post-processing, limiting scalability. To\novercome these issues, GS-Occ3D optimizes an explicit occupancy representation\nusing an Octree-based Gaussian Surfel formulation, ensuring efficiency and\nscalability. Additionally, we decompose scenes into static background, ground,\nand dynamic objects, enabling tailored modeling strategies: (1) Ground is\nexplicitly reconstructed as a dominant structural element, significantly\nimproving large-area consistency; (2) Dynamic vehicles are separately modeled\nto better capture motion-related occupancy patterns. Extensive experiments on\nthe Waymo dataset demonstrate that GS-Occ3D achieves state-of-the-art geometry\nreconstruction results. By curating vision-only binary occupancy labels from\ndiverse urban scenes, we show their effectiveness for downstream occupancy\nmodels on Occ3D-Waymo and superior zero-shot generalization on Occ3D-nuScenes.\nIt highlights the potential of large-scale vision-based occupancy\nreconstruction as a new paradigm for autonomous driving perception.

Project Page: https://bjkim95.github.io/haircup/", "summary": "We present a universal prior model for 3D head avatars with explicit hair\ncompositionality. Existing approaches to build generalizable priors for 3D head\navatars often adopt a holistic modeling approach, treating the face and hair as\nan inseparable entity. This overlooks the inherent compositionality of the\nhuman head, making it difficult for the model to naturally disentangle face and\nhair representations, especially when the dataset is limited. Furthermore, such\nholistic models struggle to support applications like 3D face and hairstyle\nswapping in a flexible and controllable manner. To address these challenges, we\nintroduce a prior model that explicitly accounts for the compositionality of\nface and hair, learning their latent spaces separately. A key enabler of this\napproach is our synthetic hairless data creation pipeline, which removes hair\nfrom studio-captured datasets using estimated hairless geometry and texture\nderived from a diffusion prior. By leveraging a paired dataset of hair and\nhairless captures, we train disentangled prior models for face and hair,\nincorporating compositionality as an inductive bias to facilitate effective\nseparation. Our model's inherent compositionality enables seamless transfer of\nface and hair components between avatars while preserving identity.\nAdditionally, we demonstrate that our model can be fine-tuned in a few-shot\nmanner using monocular captures to create high-fidelity, hair-compositional 3D\nhead avatars for unseen subjects. These capabilities highlight the practical\napplicability of our approach in real-world scenarios, paving the way for\nflexible and expressive 3D avatar generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u663e\u5f0f\u5206\u79bb\u9762\u90e8\u548c\u5934\u53d1\u6210\u5206\u76843D\u5934\u90e8\u865a\u62df\u5f62\u8c61\u901a\u7528\u5148\u9a8c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u7075\u6d3b\u652f\u6301\u9762\u90e8\u548c\u53d1\u578b\u4ea4\u6362\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5c06\u9762\u90e8\u548c\u5934\u53d1\u89c6\u4e3a\u4e0d\u53ef\u5206\u5272\u7684\u6574\u4f53\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u5176\u56fa\u6709\u7ec4\u5408\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u6709\u9650\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0b\u81ea\u7136\u5206\u79bb\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4e14\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u6210\u65e0\u5934\u53d1\u6570\u636e\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u5b66\u4e60\u9762\u90e8\u548c\u5934\u53d1\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7ec4\u5408\u6027\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u6548\u5206\u79bb\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u652f\u6301\u65e0\u7f1d\u7684\u9762\u90e8\u548c\u5934\u53d1\u7ec4\u4ef6\u8f6c\u79fb\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u5c11\u91cf\u5355\u76ee\u6355\u83b7\u5fae\u8c03\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u865a\u62df\u5f62\u8c61\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u7075\u6d3b\u4e14\u9ad8\u8868\u8fbe\u76843D\u865a\u62df\u5f62\u8c61\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}
