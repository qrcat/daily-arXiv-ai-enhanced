In scientific visualization,\nvolume rendering plays a crucial role in helping researchers analyze and\ninterpret complex 3D data. Recently, photorealistic rendering techniques have\ngained popularity in scientific visualization, yet they face significant\nchallenges. One of the most prominent issues is slow rendering performance and\nhigh pixel variance caused by Monte Carlo integration. In this work, we\nintroduce a novel radiance caching approach for path-traced volume rendering.\nOur method leverages advances in volumetric scene representation and adapts 3D\nGaussian splatting to function as a multi-level, path-space radiance cache.\nThis cache is designed to be trainable on the fly, dynamically adapting to\nchanges in scene parameters such as lighting configurations and transfer\nfunctions. By incorporating our cache, we achieve less noisy, higher-quality\nimages without increasing rendering costs. To evaluate our approach, we compare\nit against a baseline path tracer that supports uniform sampling and next-event\nestimation and the state-of-the-art for neural radiance caching.

First, a catalog of quality criteria for these\nsubdivision algorithms is developed, serving as a guideline for the\nconstruction process.\n  The construction begins by generating the desired subdominant eigenvectors as\nthe vertices of regular convex 3-polytopes for volumes using circle packings.\nSubsequently, these polytopes are utilized to construct a\nColin-de-Verdiere-matrix for the generalized quadratic and a\nColin-de-Verdiere-like matrix for the generalized cubic B-spline subdivision.\nThese matrices are then adjusted using the matrix exponential to obtain\nsubdivision matrices with the desired properties.\n  All subdivision algorithms introduced in this paper empirically exhibit a\nsubdominant eigenvalue of 1/2 with the desired algebraic and geometric\nmultiplicity. For the quadratic case, this property can even be formally\nproven. Moreover, the corresponding eigenvectors form a convex polytope in the\ncentral region for the generalized quadratic B-spline subdivision algorithms,\nwhile for the generalized cubic B-spline subdivision algorithms, they represent\nthe refinement of a convex polytope. Additionally, the constructed subdivision\nalgorithms fulfill various other quality criteria, such as affine invariance\nand convex hull preservation and respecting all symmetries. Furthermore, it is\ndemonstrated that the original Catmull-Clark algorithm is not suitable for\ngeneralization to volumetric subdivision and that the established subdivision\nalgorithms [Baj+02] and [JM99] do not exhibit a suitable spectrum for several\ncombinatorial configurations.

While data pooling (combining datasets from multiple sources)\nand data addition (adding more data from a new dataset) have been shown to\nenhance model performance, they are not without complications. Specifically,\nincreasing the size of the training dataset through pooling or addition can\ninduce distributional shifts, negatively affecting downstream model\nperformance, a phenomenon known as the \"Data Addition Dilemma\". While the\ntraditional i.i.d. assumption may not hold in multi-source contexts, assuming\nexchangeability across datasets provides a more practical framework for data\npooling. In this work, we investigate medical image segmentation under these\nconditions, drawing insights from causal frameworks to propose a method for\ncontrolling foreground-background feature discrepancies across all layers of\ndeep networks. This approach improves feature representations, which are\ncrucial in data-addition scenarios.

In this work, we formulate\na surgical tool segmentation as a unified part-aware instance segmentation\n(PIS) problem and introduce SurgPIS, the first PIS model for surgical\ninstruments. Our method adopts a transformer-based mask classification approach\nand introduces part-specific queries derived from instrument-level object\nqueries, explicitly linking parts to their parent instrument instances. In\norder to address the lack of large-scale datasets with both instance- and\npart-level labels, we propose a weakly-supervised learning strategy for SurgPIS\nto learn from disjoint datasets labelled for either IIS or PSS purposes.

This is especially evident in\nmammography, where dense breast tissue can obscure lesions, complicating\nradiological interpretation. Despite leveraging anatomical and semantic\ncontext, existing detection methods struggle to learn effective class-specific\nfeatures, limiting their applicability across different tasks and imaging\nmodalities. In this work, we introduce Exemplar Med-DETR, a novel multi-modal\ncontrastive detector that enables feature-based detection. It employs\ncross-attention with inherently derived, intuitive class-specific exemplar\nfeatures and is trained with an iterative strategy. We achieve state-of-the-art\nperformance across three distinct imaging modalities from four public datasets.\nOn Vietnamese dense breast mammograms, we attain an mAP of 0.7 for mass\ndetection and 0.55 for calcifications, yielding an absolute improvement of 16\npercentage points.

The skin sensors employed in this study\npossess the capability to quantify multimodal tactile information at multiple\ncontact points. The time-series data generated from these sensors is\nanticipated to facilitate the classification of diverse contact motions\nexhibited by an operator. By mapping the classification results with robot\nmotion primitives, a diverse range of robot motions can be generated by\naltering the manner in which the skin sensors are interacted with. In this\npaper, we focus on a learning-based contact motion classifier employing\nrecurrent neural networks. This classifier is a pivotal factor in the success\nof this framework. Furthermore, we elucidate the requisite conditions for\nsoftware-hardware designs. Firstly, multimodal sensing and its comprehensive\nencoding significantly contribute to the enhancement of classification accuracy\nand learning stability. Utilizing all modalities simultaneously as inputs to\nthe classifier proves to be an effective approach. Secondly, it is essential to\nmount the skin sensors on a flexible and compliant support to enable the\nactivation of three-axis accelerometers. These accelerometers are capable of\nmeasuring horizontal tactile information, thereby enhancing the correlation\nwith other modalities. Furthermore, they serve to absorb the noises generated\nby the robot's movements during deployment. Through these discoveries, the\naccuracy of the developed classifier surpassed 95 %, enabling the dual-arm\nmobile manipulator to execute a diverse range of tasks via the Skin-Machine\nInterface. https://youtu.be/UjUXT4Z4BC8", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u76ae\u80a4\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u4f5c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u754c\u9762\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u89e6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u5206\u7c7b\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u6837\u5316\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u52a8\u4f5c\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u76ae\u80a4\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u4f5c\u4e3a\u65b0\u578b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u754c\u9762\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u89e6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u5206\u7c7b\u63d0\u5347\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u5faa\u73af\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5904\u7406\u76ae\u80a4\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8f6f\u4ef6-\u786c\u4ef6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4f18\u5316\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8d85\u8fc795%\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u53cc\u81c2\u79fb\u52a8\u673a\u68b0\u81c2\u901a\u8fc7\u76ae\u80a4-\u673a\u5668\u754c\u9762\u6267\u884c\u591a\u6837\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4f20\u611f\u548c\u67d4\u6027\u652f\u6301\u8bbe\u8ba1\u662f\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5173\u952e\uff0c\u76ae\u80a4\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u754c\u9762\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002"}}

We present SynPAIN, a\nlarge-scale synthetic dataset containing 10,710 facial expression images (5,355\nneutral/expressive pairs) across five ethnicities/races, two age groups (young:\n20-35, old: 75+), and two genders. Using commercial generative AI tools, we\ncreated demographically balanced synthetic identities with clinically\nmeaningful pain expressions. Our validation demonstrates that synthetic pain\nexpressions exhibit expected pain patterns, scoring significantly higher than\nneutral and non-pain expressions using clinically validated pain assessment\ntools based on facial action unit analysis.

To overcome this limitation, this paper\nintroduces the \"Think, Act, Learn\" (T-A-L) framework, a novel architecture that\nenables an embodied agent to autonomously learn and refine its policies through\ncontinuous interaction. Our framework establishes a closed-loop cycle where an\nLLM first \"thinks\" by decomposing high-level commands into actionable plans.\nThe robot then \"acts\" by executing these plans while gathering rich, multimodal\nsensory feedback. Critically, the \"learn\" module processes this feedback to\nfacilitate LLM-driven self-reflection, allowing the agent to perform causal\nanalysis on its failures and generate corrective strategies. These insights are\nstored in an experiential memory to guide future planning cycles. We\ndemonstrate through extensive experiments in both simulation and the real world\nthat our T-A-L agent significantly outperforms baseline methods, including\nopen-loop LLMs, Behavioral Cloning, and traditional Reinforcement Learning.

Semantic keypoints of clothes can be reliably\nextracted from RGB-D images and provide an effective intermediate\nrepresentation of clothes manipulation policies. CLASP uses semantic keypoints\nto bridge high-level task planning and low-level action execution. At the high\nlevel, it exploits vision language models (VLMs) to predict task plans over the\nsemantic keypoints. At the low level, it executes the plans with the help of a\nsimple pre-built manipulation skill library. Extensive simulation experiments\nshow that CLASP outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods on multiple tasks\nacross diverse clothes types, demonstrating strong performance and\ngeneralization. Further experiments with a Franka dual-arm system on four\ndistinct tasks -- folding, flattening, hanging, and placing -- confirm CLASP's\nperformance on a real robot.", "AI": {"tldr": "CLASP\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u4e49\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u7684\u901a\u7528\u8863\u7269\u64cd\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u8863\u7269\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u9884\u5efa\u6280\u80fd\u5e93\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8863\u7269\u64cd\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u8863\u7269\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u7684\u9ad8\u7ef4\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u8bed\u4e49\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e2d\u95f4\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u4efb\u52a1\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u5efa\u6280\u80fd\u5e93\u6267\u884c\u52a8\u4f5c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cCLASP\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u8863\u7269\u7c7b\u578b\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "CLASP\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8bed\u4e49\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u5728\u901a\u7528\u8863\u7269\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

These discrepancies suggest the functional role that material\nproperties such as packing and cohesion/entanglement play in excavation and\nconstruction.

However, as these models are deployed in increasingly diverse\nand resource-constrained environments, there is a pressing need for\narchitectures that can deliver high performance while requiring fewer\ncomputational resources.\n  This dissertation focuses on architectural principles through which models\ncan achieve increased performance while reducing their computational demands.\nWe discuss strides towards this goal through three directions. First, we focus\non data ingress and egress, investigating how information may be passed into\nand retrieved from our core neural processing units. This ensures that our\nmodels make the most of available data, allowing smaller architectures to\nbecome more performant.

However, the roles of existing\ndecoder query types (e.g., content query and positional query) are still\nunderexplored. These queries are generally predefined with a fixed number\n(fixed-query), which limits their flexibility. We find that the learning of\nthese fixed-query is impaired by Recurrent Opposing inTeractions (ROT) between\ntwo attention operations: Self-Attention (query-to-query) and Cross-Attention\n(query-to-encoder), thereby degrading decoder efficiency. Furthermore, \"query\nambiguity\" arises when shared-weight decoder layers are processed with both\none-to-one and one-to-many label assignments during training, violating DETR's\none-to-one matching principle. To address these challenges, we propose DS-Det,\na more efficient detector capable of detecting a flexible number of objects in\nimages.

By leveraging robotic tracking data, a sparse tactile\npoint cloud is generated through a few scans along the rib, mimicking human\npalpation.

This involves recognizing and interpreting the hands, face, and\nbody gestures of the signer, which pose a challenge as it involves a\ncombination of all these features. Continuous Sign Language Recognition (CSLR)\nmethods rely on multi-stage pipelines that first extract visual features, then\nalign variable-length sequences with target glosses using CTC or HMM-based\napproaches. However, these alignment-based methods suffer from error\npropagation across stages, overfitting, and struggle with vocabulary\nscalability due to the intermediate gloss representation bottleneck. To address\nthese limitations, we propose AutoSign, an autoregressive decoder-only\ntransformer that directly translates pose sequences to natural language text,\nbypassing traditional alignment mechanisms entirely. The use of this\ndecoder-only approach allows the model to directly map between the features and\nthe glosses without the need for CTC loss while also directly learning the\ntextual dependencies in the glosses.

Although negative prompt tuning has enhanced the OOD detection\ncapabilities of vision-language models, these tuned models often suffer from\nreduced generalization performance on unseen classes and styles. To address\nthis challenge, we propose a novel method called Knowledge Regularized Negative\nFeature Tuning (KR-NFT), which integrates an innovative adaptation architecture\ntermed Negative Feature Tuning (NFT) and a corresponding\nknowledge-regularization (KR) optimization strategy. Specifically, NFT applies\ndistribution-aware transformations to pre-trained text features, effectively\nseparating positive and negative features into distinct spaces. This separation\nmaximizes the distinction between in-distribution (ID) and OOD images.\nAdditionally, we introduce image-conditional learnable factors through a\nlightweight meta-network, enabling dynamic adaptation to individual images and\nmitigating sensitivity to class and style shifts. Compared to traditional\nnegative prompt tuning, NFT demonstrates superior efficiency and scalability.\nTo optimize this adaptation architecture, the KR optimization strategy is\ndesigned to enhance the discrimination between ID and OOD sets while mitigating\npre-trained knowledge forgetting. This enhances OOD detection performance on\ntrained ID classes while simultaneously improving OOD detection on unseen ID\ndatasets. Notably, when trained with few-shot samples from ImageNet dataset,\nKR-NFT not only improves ID classification accuracy and OOD detection but also\nsignificantly reduces the FPR95 by 5.44\\% under an unexplored generalization\nsetting with unseen ID categories.

The Motion-adaptive State Modulator is\nresponsible for joint-specific motion characteristics recognition, thus\napplying tailored adjustments to diverse motion patterns across different\njoints.

To address these, we\npropose RaGS, the first framework to leverage 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) as\nrepresentation for fusing 4D radar and monocular cues in 3D object detection.\n3D GS naturally suits 3D object detection by modeling the scene as a field of\nGaussians, dynamically allocating resources on foreground objects and providing\na flexible, resource-efficient solution. RaGS uses a cascaded pipeline to\nconstruct and refine the Gaussian field. It starts with the Frustum-based\nLocalization Initiation (FLI), which unprojects foreground pixels to initialize\ncoarse 3D Gaussians positions. Then, the Iterative Multimodal Aggregation (IMA)\nfuses semantics and geometry, refining the limited Gaussians to the regions of\ninterest. Finally, the Multi-level Gaussian Fusion (MGF) renders the Gaussians\ninto multi-level BEV features for 3D object detection. By dynamically focusing\non sparse objects within scenes, RaGS enable object concentrating while\noffering comprehensive scene perception.

Variations in LiDAR types and\ndynamic elements lead to differences in point cloud distribution and scene\nconsistency, hindering reliable descriptor generation and loop closure\ndetection essential for accurate map alignment. To address these challenges,\nthis paper presents Uni-Mapper, a dynamic-aware 3D point cloud map merging\nframework for multi-modal LiDAR systems. It comprises dynamic object removal,\ndynamic-aware loop closure, and multi-modal LiDAR map merging modules. A\nvoxel-wise free space hash map is built in a coarse-to-fine manner to identify\nand reject dynamic objects via temporal occupancy inconsistencies. The removal\nmodule is integrated with a LiDAR global descriptor, which encodes preserved\nstatic local features to ensure robust place recognition in dynamic\nenvironments. In the final stage, multiple pose graph optimizations are\nconducted for both intra-session and inter-map loop closures. We adopt a\ncentralized anchor-node strategy to mitigate intra-session drift errors during\nmap merging.

(2) For the textual modality, we achieve precise target words\nidentification solely based on textual content, and design an innovative\ncontext words calibration method to adaptively utilize auxiliary context words.\n(3) We conduct extensive experiments on mainstream benchmarks and ATCTrack\nachieves a new SOTA performance.

A critical challenge is the\nagent's ability to identify and monitor environmental elements pertinent to its\nobjectives. Our research introduces a neurosymbolic modular architecture for\nreactive robotics. Our system combines a neural component performing object\nrecognition over the environment and image processing techniques such as\noptical flow, with symbolic representation and reasoning. The reasoning system\nis grounded in the embodied cognition paradigm, via integrating image schematic\nknowledge in an ontological structure. The ontology is operatively used to\ncreate queries for the perception system, decide on actions, and infer\nentities' capabilities derived from perceptual data. The combination of\nreasoning and image processing allows the agent to focus its perception for\nnormal operation as well as discover new concepts for parts of objects involved\nin particular interactions. The discovered concepts allow the robot to\nautonomously acquire training data and adjust its subsymbolic perception to\nrecognize the parts, as well as making planning for more complex tasks feasible\nby focusing search on those relevant object parts.

However, achieving human-like prediction and decision-making in\ninteractions with vulnerable road users remains a key challenge in complex\nmulti-agent interactive environments. Existing research focuses primarily on\ncrowd navigation for small mobile robots, which cannot be directly applied to\nAVs due to inherent differences in their decision-making strategies and dynamic\nboundaries. Moreover, pedestrians in these multi-agent simulations follow fixed\nbehavior patterns that cannot dynamically respond to AV actions. To overcome\nthese limitations, this paper proposes a novel framework for modeling\ninteractions between the AV and multiple pedestrians. In this framework, a\ncognitive process modeling approach inspired by the Free Energy Principle is\nintegrated into both the AV and pedestrian models to simulate more realistic\ninteraction dynamics. Specifically, the proposed pedestrian Cognitive-Risk\nSocial Force Model adjusts goal-directed and repulsive forces using a fused\nmeasure of cognitive uncertainty and physical risk to produce human-like\ntrajectories.

While progress has been made in binary\nforgery video detection, the lack of fine-grained understanding of forgery\ntypes raises concerns regarding both reliability and interpretability, which\nare critical for real-world applications. To address this limitation, we\npropose HumanSAM, a new framework that builds upon the fundamental challenges\nof video generation models. Specifically, HumanSAM aims to classify\nhuman-centric forgeries into three distinct types of artifacts commonly\nobserved in generated content: spatial, appearance, and motion anomaly.To\nbetter capture the features of geometry, semantics and spatiotemporal\nconsistency, we propose to generate the human forgery representation by fusing\ntwo branches of video understanding and spatial depth.

Existing methods typically demand substantial training\nsamples, limiting their utility in zero-/few-shot scenarios.

In this work, we propose AF-CLIP (Anomaly-Focused\nCLIP) by dramatically enhancing its visual representations to focus on local\ndefects. Our approach introduces a lightweight adapter that emphasizes\nanomaly-relevant patterns in visual features, simultaneously optimizing both\nclass-level features for image classification and patch-level features for\nprecise localization. To capture anomalies of different sizes and improve\ndetection accuracy, prior to the adapter, we develop a multi-scale spatial\naggregation mechanism to effectively consolidate neighborhood context.\nComplementing these visual enhancements, we design learnable textual prompts\nthat generically characterize normal and abnormal states. After optimization on\nauxiliary datasets using a composite objective function, AF-CLIP demonstrates\nstrong zero-shot detection capability.

While current research has introduced non-invasive and efficient\napproaches to predict CVD risk from retinal imaging with deep learning models,\nthe commonly used fundus photographs and Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT)\nfail to capture detailed vascular features critical for CVD assessment compared\nwith OCT angiography (OCTA) images. Moreover, existing methods typically\nclassify CVD risk only as high or low, without providing a deeper analysis on\nCVD-related blood factor conditions, thus limiting prediction accuracy and\nclinical utility. As a result, we propose a novel multi-purpose paradigm of CVD\nrisk assessment that jointly performs CVD risk and CVD-related condition\nprediction, aligning with clinical experiences. Based on this core idea, we\nintroduce OCTA-CVD, the first OCTA dataset for CVD risk assessment, and a\nVessel-Aware Mamba-based Prediction model with Informative Enhancement\n(VAMPIRE) based on OCTA enface images.

Although some methods\nintegrate extra information to generate identity-aware descriptions, the player\nidentities are sometimes incorrect because the extra information is independent\nof the video content. This paper proposes a player-centric multimodal prompt\ngeneration network for identity-aware sports video captioning (LLM-IAVC), which\nfocuses on recognizing player identities from a visual perspective.\nSpecifically, an identity-related information extraction module (IRIEM) is\ndesigned to extract player-related multimodal embeddings. IRIEM includes a\nplayer identification network (PIN) for extracting visual features and player\nnames, and a bidirectional semantic interaction module (BSIM) to link player\nfeatures with video content for mutual enhancement. Additionally, a visual\ncontext learning module (VCLM) is designed to capture the key video context\ninformation. Finally, by integrating the outputs of the above modules as the\nmultimodal prompt for the large language model (LLM), it facilitates the\ngeneration of descriptions with player identities.

We introduce linear assignment-based\npoint pairing to optimise the TPC reconstruction process, and negate the use of\nexpensive point-wise attention mechanisms in the architecture. Using these\nlatent features, we pre-train a motion synthesis model capable of performing\nmotion prediction, transition generation, and keyframe interpolation. For these\npre-training tasks, PUMPS performs remarkably well even without native dataset\nsupervision, matching state-of-the-art performance.

The first two authors contributed equally", "summary": "The emergence of large foundation models has propelled significant advances\nin various domains. The Segment Anything Model (SAM), a leading model for image\nsegmentation, exemplifies these advances, outperforming traditional methods.\nHowever, such foundation models often suffer from performance degradation when\napplied to complex tasks for which they are not trained. Existing methods\ntypically employ adapter-based fine-tuning strategies to adapt SAM for tasks\nand leverage high-frequency features extracted from the Fourier domain.\nHowever, Our analysis reveals that these approaches offer limited benefits due\nto constraints in their feature extraction techniques. To overcome this, we\npropose \\textbf{\\textit{SAMwave}}, a novel and interpretable approach that\nutilizes the wavelet transform to extract richer, multi-scale high-frequency\nfeatures from input data.

Extensive evaluations across five\npublic MI datasets demonstrated that MIRepNet consistently achieved\nstate-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming both specialized and\ngeneralized EEG models.

To address\nthis critical challenge, we propose a fast and general-purpose framework for\ncross-sensor adaptation, SWIFT (Sensitive Weight Identification for Fast\nTransfer). Specifically, SWIFT employs an unsupervised sampling strategy based\non data manifold structures to balance sample selection while mitigating the\nbias of traditional Farthest Point Sampling, efficiently selecting only 3\\% of\nthe most informative samples from the target domain. This subset is then used\nto probe a source-domain pre-trained model by analyzing the gradient behavior\nof its parameters, allowing for the quick identification and subsequent update\nof only the weight subset most sensitive to the domain shift. As a\nplug-and-play framework, SWIFT can be applied to various existing pansharpening\nmodels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SWIFT reduces the adaptation\ntime from hours to approximately one minute on a single NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU.\nThe adapted models not only substantially outperform direct-transfer baselines\nbut also achieve performance competitive with, and in some cases superior to,\nfull retraining, establishing a new state-of-the-art on cross-sensor\npansharpening tasks for the WorldView-2 and QuickBird datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "SWIFT\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u654f\u611f\u6743\u91cd\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u5feb\u901f\u9002\u5e94\u8de8\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8de8\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u5168\u91cf\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u9009\u62e9\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u4fe1\u606f\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u68af\u5ea6\u884c\u4e3a\u66f4\u65b0\u654f\u611f\u6743\u91cd\u3002", "result": "SWIFT\u5c06\u9002\u5e94\u65f6\u95f4\u7f29\u77ed\u81f3\u7ea6\u4e00\u5206\u949f\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u76f4\u63a5\u8fc1\u79fb\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u5ab2\u7f8e\u5168\u91cf\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "conclusion": "SWIFT\u4e3a\u8de8\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u56fe\u50cf\u878d\u5408\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u901a\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u65b0\u9ad8\u5ea6\u3002"}}

Achieving both temporal consistency, or realistic lighting remains\ndifficult, particularly in dynamic scenarios with complex object motion,\nperspective changes, and varying illumination. While 2D diffusion models have\nshown promise for producing photorealistic edits, they often struggle with\nmaintaining temporal coherence across frames. Conversely, traditional 3D\nrendering methods excel in spatial and temporal consistency but fall short in\nachieving photorealistic lighting. In this work, we propose a hybrid object\ninsertion pipeline that combines the strengths of both paradigms. Specifically,\nwe focus on inserting bracelets into dynamic wrist scenes, leveraging the high\ntemporal consistency of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for initial rendering and\nrefining the results using a 2D diffusion-based enhancement model to ensure\nrealistic lighting interactions. Our method introduces a shading-driven\npipeline that separates intrinsic object properties (albedo, shading,\nreflectance) and refines both shading and sRGB images for photorealism. To\nmaintain temporal coherence, we optimize the 3DGS model with multi-frame\nweighted adjustments. This is the first approach to synergize 3D rendering and\n2D diffusion for video object insertion, offering a robust solution for\nrealistic and consistent video editing.

While\ntechniques such as automatic prompt engineering, controlled text embeddings,\ndenoising, and multi-turn generation mitigate these issues, they offer limited\ncontrollability, or often necessitate additional training, restricting the\ngeneralization abilities. Thus, we introduce T2I-Copilot, a training-free\nmulti-agent system that leverages collaboration between (Multimodal) Large\nLanguage Models to automate prompt phrasing, model selection, and iterative\nrefinement. This approach significantly simplifies prompt engineering while\nenhancing generation quality and text-image alignment compared to direct\ngeneration. Specifically, T2I-Copilot consists of three agents: (1) Input\nInterpreter, which parses the input prompt, resolves ambiguities, and generates\na standardized report; (2) Generation Engine, which selects the appropriate\nmodel from different types of T2I models and organizes visual and textual\nprompts to initiate generation; and (3) Quality Evaluator, which assesses\naesthetic quality and text-image alignment, providing scores and feedback for\npotential regeneration. T2I-Copilot can operate fully autonomously while also\nsupporting human-in-the-loop intervention for fine-grained control.

This paper recognises this very problem and\nstudies sketch quality assessment for the first time -- letting you find these\nbadly drawn ones. Our key discovery lies in exploiting the magnitude ($L_2$\nnorm) of a sketch feature as a quantitative quality metric. We propose\nGeometry-Aware Classification Layer (GACL), a generic method that makes\nfeature-magnitude-as-quality-metric possible and importantly does it without\nthe need for specific quality annotations from humans. GACL sees feature\nmagnitude and recognisability learning as a dual task, which can be\nsimultaneously optimised under a neat cross-entropy classification loss with\ntheoretic guarantee. This gives GACL a nice geometric interpretation (the\nbetter the quality, the easier the recognition), and makes it agnostic to both\nnetwork architecture changes and the underlying sketch representation. Through\na large scale human study of 160,000 \\doublecheck{trials}, we confirm the\nagreement between our GACL-induced metric and human quality perception. We\nfurther demonstrate how such a quality assessment capability can for the first\ntime enable three practical sketch applications.

They could reveal genuine emotions individuals may attempt to\nconceal, valuable in contexts like criminal interrogation and psychological\ncounseling. However, ME recognition (MER) faces challenges, such as small\nsample sizes and subtle features, which hinder efficient modeling.\nAdditionally, real-world applications encounter ME data privacy issues, leaving\nthe task of enhancing recognition across settings under privacy constraints\nlargely unexplored. To address these issues, we propose a FED-PsyAU research\nframework.

The spatially sequential arrangement of adjacent MRI slices provides\nvaluable information that enhances segmentation continuity and accuracy, yet\nthis characteristic remains underutilized in many existing models. The spatial\ncorrelations between adjacent MRI slices can be regarded as \"temporal-like\"\ndata, similar to frame sequences in video segmentation tasks.

The key challenge\nlies in identifying which tokens are truly important. Most existing approaches\nrely on attention-based criteria to estimate token importance. However, they\ninherently suffer from certain limitations, such as positional bias. In this\nwork, we explore a new perspective on token importance based on token\ntransitions in LVLMs. We observe that the transition of token representations\nprovides a meaningful signal of semantic information. Based on this insight, we\npropose TransPrune, a training-free and efficient token pruning method.\nSpecifically, TransPrune progressively prunes tokens by assessing their\nimportance through a combination of Token Transition Variation (TTV)-which\nmeasures changes in both the magnitude and direction of token\nrepresentations-and Instruction-Guided Attention (IGA), which measures how\nstrongly the instruction attends to image tokens via attention. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that TransPrune achieves comparable multimodal\nperformance to original LVLMs, such as LLaVA-v1.5 and LLaVA-Next, across eight\nbenchmarks, while reducing inference TFLOPs by more than half. Moreover, TTV\nalone can serve as an effective criterion without relying on attention,\nachieving performance comparable to attention-based methods.

Despite progress in same-domain composition, cross-domain\ncomposition remains under-explored. The main challenges are the stochastic\nnature of diffusion models and the style gap between input images, leading to\nfailures and artifacts. Additionally, heavy reliance on text prompts limits\npractical applications. This paper presents the first cross-domain image\ncomposition method that does not require text prompts, allowing natural\nstylization and seamless compositions. Our method is efficient and robust,\npreserving the diffusion prior, as it involves minor steps for backward\ninversion and forward denoising without training the diffuser. Our method also\nuses a simple multilayer perceptron network to integrate CLIP features from\nforeground and background, manipulating diffusion with a local cross-attention\nstrategy. It effectively preserves foreground content while enabling stable\nstylization without a pre-stylization network. Finally, we create a benchmark\ndataset with diverse contents and styles for fair evaluation, addressing the\nlack of testing datasets for cross-domain image composition.

However, vision systems based on conventional imaging are limited to\nextracting information only from the visible surfaces of scene objects. For\ninstance, a vision system can detect and identify a Coke can in the scene, but\nit cannot determine whether the can is full or empty. In this paper, we aim to\nexpand the scope of computer vision to include the novel task of inferring the\nhidden liquid levels of opaque containers by sensing the tiny vibrations on\ntheir surfaces. Our method provides a first-of-a-kind way to inspect the fill\nlevel of multiple sealed containers remotely, at once, without needing physical\nmanipulation and manual weighing. First, we propose a novel speckle-based\nvibration sensing system for simultaneously capturing scene vibrations on a 2D\ngrid of points. We use our system to efficiently and remotely capture a dataset\nof vibration responses for a variety of everyday liquid containers.

Subsequent investigations into\nenhancing their visual reasoning abilities have significantly expanded their\nperformance envelope. However, a critical bottleneck in the advancement of\nMLLMs toward deep visual reasoning is their heavy reliance on curated\nimage-text supervision. To solve this problem, we introduce a novel framework\ntermed ``Reasoning-Rendering-Visual-Feedback'' (RRVF), which enables MLLMs to\nlearn complex visual reasoning from only raw images. This framework builds on\nthe ``Asymmetry of Verification'' principle to train MLLMs, i.e., verifying the\nrendered output against a source image is easier than generating it. We\ndemonstrate that this relative ease provides an ideal reward signal for\noptimization via Reinforcement Learning (RL) training, reducing the reliance on\nthe image-text supervision. Guided by the above principle, RRVF implements a\nclosed-loop iterative process encompassing reasoning, rendering, and visual\nfeedback components, enabling the model to perform self-correction through\nmulti-turn interactions and tool invocation, while this pipeline can be\noptimized by the GRPO algorithm in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments\non image-to-code generation for data charts and web interfaces show that RRVF\nsubstantially outperforms existing open-source MLLMs and surpasses supervised\nfine-tuning baselines.

Extensive experiments on\nvarious RS vision-language tasks demonstrate that RingMo-Agent not only proves\neffective in both visual understanding and sophisticated analytical tasks, but\nalso exhibits strong generalizability across different platforms and sensing\nmodalities.", "AI": {"tldr": "RingMo-Agent\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u591a\u5e73\u53f0\u9065\u611f\u56fe\u50cf\u5904\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7528\u6237\u6587\u672c\u6307\u4ee4\u6267\u884c\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6RS-VL3M\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u6a21\u6001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8868\u793a\u548c\u7edf\u4e00\u4efb\u52a1\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9065\u611f\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u7814\u7a76\u4f9d\u8d56\u540c\u8d28\u6570\u636e\u6e90\uff0c\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u5206\u7c7b\u6216\u63cf\u8ff0\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u7edf\u4e00\u5904\u7406\u591a\u6e90\u6570\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRingMo-Agent\uff0c\u5229\u7528RS-VL3M\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6a21\u6001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5d4c\u5165\u5c42\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u4ee4\u724c\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eRingMo-Agent\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u590d\u6742\u5206\u6790\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4e14\u8de8\u5e73\u53f0\u548c\u6a21\u6001\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5f3a\u3002", "conclusion": "RingMo-Agent\u4e3a\u591a\u6e90\u9065\u611f\u56fe\u50cf\u5904\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Recent progress in self-supervised\nrepresentation learning has led to some success in UOD algorithms. However, the\nabsence of ground truth provides existing UOD methods with two challenges: 1)\ndetermining if a discovered region is foreground or background, and 2) knowing\nhow many objects remain undiscovered. To address these two problems, previous\nsolutions rely on foreground priors to distinguish if the discovered region is\nforeground, and conduct one or fixed iterations of discovery. However, the\nexisting foreground priors are heuristic and not always robust, and a fixed\nnumber of discoveries leads to under or over-segmentation, since the number of\nobjects in images varies. This paper introduces UnionCut, a robust and\nwell-grounded foreground prior based on min-cut and ensemble methods that\ndetects the union of foreground areas of an image, allowing UOD algorithms to\nidentify foreground objects and stop discovery once the majority of the\nforeground union in the image is segmented.

Traditional\nimage-based de-snowing methods often introduce hallucination artifacts as they\nrely solely on spatial information, while video-based approaches require high\nframe rates and suffer from alignment artifacts at lower frame rates. Camera\nparameters, such as exposure time, also influence the appearance of snowflakes,\nmaking the problem difficult to solve and heavily dependent on network\ngeneralization. In this paper, we propose to address the challenge of desnowing\nby using event cameras, which offer compressed visual information with\nsubmillisecond latency, making them ideal for de-snowing images, even in the\npresence of ego-motion. Our method leverages the fact that snowflake occlusions\nappear with a very distinctive streak signature in the spatio-temporal\nrepresentation of event data. We design an attention-based module that focuses\non events along these streaks to determine when a background point was occluded\nand use this information to recover its original intensity. We benchmark our\nmethod on DSEC-Snow, a new dataset created using a green-screen technique that\noverlays pre-recorded snowfall data onto the existing DSEC driving dataset,\nresulting in precise ground truth and synchronized image and event streams.

Despite its progress in remote sensing\napplications, RIS in Low-Altitude Drone (LAD) scenarios remains underexplored.\nExisting datasets and methods are typically designed for high-altitude and\nstatic-view imagery. They struggle to handle the unique characteristics of LAD\nviews, such as diverse viewpoints and high object density. To fill this gap, we\npresent RIS-LAD, the first fine-grained RIS benchmark tailored for LAD\nscenarios. This dataset comprises 13,871 carefully annotated image-text-mask\ntriplets collected from realistic drone footage, with a focus on small,\ncluttered, and multi-viewpoint scenes. It highlights new challenges absent in\nprevious benchmarks, such as category drift caused by tiny objects and object\ndrift under crowded same-class objects.

One drawback of QBE searches is that they require\nsample query documents on hand that may not be available. ABDIR aims to offer\nusers a flexible way to retrieve document images based on memorable visual\nfeatures of document contents, describing document images with combinations of\nvisual attributes determined via convolutional neural network (CNN)-based\nbinary classifiers. We present an exploratory study of the use of generative AI\nto bridge the gap between QBE and ABDIR, focusing on historical documents as a\nuse case for their diversity and uniqueness in visual features. We hypothesize\nthat text-to-image (T2I) generation can be leveraged to create query document\nimages using text prompts based on ABDIR-like attributes.

Hence, to preserve identity-related visual details from\nthe lower half, these approaches additionally require an unmasked identity\nreference image randomly selected from the same video.

Furthermore, we introduce two newly annotated aerial\ndatasets from New Zealand and Utah to support further research in this field.\nProject page is available at: https://humansensinglab.github.io/AGenDA", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5408\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u822a\u62cd\u56fe\u50cf\u53ca\u5176\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8de8\u533a\u57df\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u822a\u62cd\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u8f66\u8f86\u68c0\u6d4b\u5728\u4ea4\u901a\u76d1\u63a7\u3001\u57ce\u5e02\u89c4\u5212\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8de8\u533a\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u65f6\u56e0\u73af\u5883\u3001\u5e03\u5c40\u7b49\u56e0\u7d20\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u3001\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fc1\u79fb\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff08LDMs\uff09\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u6e90\u57df\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u822a\u62cd\u56fe\u50cf\u57df\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0cAP50\u6307\u6807\u5206\u522b\u4f18\u4e8e\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u9002\u5e94\u3001\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u5f00\u653e\u96c6\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8de8\u533a\u57df\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u8d21\u732e\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u822a\u62cd\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u76f8\u5173\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

Despite advances in adversarial training, a gap persists between\nmodel accuracy and robustness. To mitigate this issue, in this paper, we\npresent a multi-teacher adversarial robustness distillation using an adaptive\nlearning strategy. Specifically, our proposed method first trained multiple\nclones of a baseline CNN model using an adversarial training strategy on a pool\nof perturbed data acquired through different adversarial attacks. Once trained,\nthese adversarially trained models are used as teacher models to supervise the\nlearning of a student model on clean data using multi-teacher knowledge\ndistillation. To ensure an effective robustness distillation, we design an\nadaptive learning strategy that controls the knowledge contribution of each\nmodel by assigning weights as per their prediction precision.

In contrast, natural language provides a more flexible,\nexpressive, and interpretable way to represent emotions, offering a much\nbroader source of supervision. Yet, leveraging semantically rich natural\nlanguage captions as supervisory signals for facial emotion representation\nlearning remains relatively underexplored, primarily due to two key challenges:\n1) the lack of large-scale caption datasets with rich emotional semantics, and\n2) the absence of effective frameworks tailored to harness such rich\nsupervision. To this end, we introduce EmoCap100K, a large-scale facial emotion\ncaption dataset comprising over 100,000 samples, featuring rich and structured\nsemantic descriptions that capture both global affective states and\nfine-grained local facial behaviors. Building upon this dataset, we further\npropose EmoCapCLIP, which incorporates a joint global-local contrastive\nlearning framework enhanced by a cross-modal guided positive mining module.\nThis design facilitates the comprehensive exploitation of multi-level caption\ninformation while accommodating semantic similarities between closely related\nexpressions.
