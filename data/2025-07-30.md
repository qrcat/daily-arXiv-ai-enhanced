Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个多模态数据集，用于支持基于可穿戴惯性测量单元（IMU）的运动分类模型开发，包括物理治疗练习和步态分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决开发健壮的传感器分类模型时缺乏大规模多样化数据集的问题。

Method: 通过同步IMU和标记运动捕捉系统（MoCap）记录19名参与者的运动数据，并提供原始和处理后的数据、工具和分析支持。

Result: 数据集包含原始和处理后的IMU数据、OpenSim模型、逆向运动学结果及可视化工具，支持多种分析目标。

Conclusion: 该数据集和配套工具旨在加速机器学习驱动的人类运动分析研究。

Abstract: Wearable inertial measurement units (IMUs) offer a cost-effective and
scalable means to assess human movement quality in clinical and everyday
settings. However, the development of robust sensor-based classification models
for physiotherapeutic exercises and gait analysis requires large, diverse
datasets, which are costly and time-consuming to collect. Here, we present a
multimodal dataset of physiotherapeutic exercises - including correct and
clinically relevant variants - and gait-related exercises - including both
normal and impaired gait patterns - recorded from 19 participants using
synchronized IMUs and marker-based motion capture (MoCap). The dataset includes
raw data from nine IMUs and thirty-five optical markers capturing full-body
kinematics. Each IMU is additionally equipped with four optical markers,
enabling precise comparison between IMU-derived orientation estimates and
reference values from the MoCap system. To support further analysis, we also
provide processed IMU orientations aligned with common segment coordinate
systems, subject-specific OpenSim models, inverse kinematics results, and tools
for visualizing IMU orientations in the musculoskeletal context. Detailed
annotations of movement execution quality and time-stamped segmentations
support diverse analysis goals. This dataset supports the development and
benchmarking of machine learning models for tasks such as automatic exercise
evaluation, gait analysis, temporal activity segmentation, and biomechanical
parameter estimation. To facilitate reproducibility, we provide code for
postprocessing, sensor-to-segment alignment, inverse kinematics computation,
and technical validation. This resource is intended to accelerate research in
machine learning-driven human movement analysis.

### [2] [Seeing Beyond Frames: Zero-Shot Pedestrian Intention Prediction with Raw Temporal Video and Multimodal Cues](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21161)
*Pallavi Zambare,Venkata Nikhil Thanikella,Ying Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BF-PIP是一种零样本方法，通过连续视频片段和JAAD元数据预测行人意图，无需额外训练，准确率达73%，优于GPT-4V基线18%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖监督学习和大量重新训练，难以适应新场景。BF-PIP旨在提供一种无需重新训练的敏捷解决方案。

Method: 基于Gemini 2.5 Pro，利用连续视频片段、JAAD元数据、边界框标注和自车速度，通过多模态提示进行意图推断。

Result: BF-PIP在零样本条件下达到73%的预测准确率，比GPT-4V基线高18%。

Conclusion: 结合时间视频输入和上下文线索可增强时空感知，提升模糊条件下的意图推断，为智能交通系统提供敏捷解决方案。

Abstract: Pedestrian intention prediction is essential for autonomous driving in
complex urban environments. Conventional approaches depend on supervised
learning over frame sequences and require extensive retraining to adapt to new
scenarios. Here, we introduce BF-PIP (Beyond Frames Pedestrian Intention
Prediction), a zero-shot approach built upon Gemini 2.5 Pro. It infers crossing
intentions directly from short, continuous video clips enriched with structured
JAAD metadata. In contrast to GPT-4V based methods that operate on discrete
frames, BF-PIP processes uninterrupted temporal clips. It also incorporates
bounding-box annotations and ego-vehicle speed via specialized multimodal
prompts. Without any additional training, BF-PIP achieves 73% prediction
accuracy, outperforming a GPT-4V baseline by 18 %. These findings illustrate
that combining temporal video inputs with contextual cues enhances
spatiotemporal perception and improves intent inference under ambiguous
conditions. This approach paves the way for agile, retraining-free perception
module in intelligent transportation system.

### [3] [VoluMe -- Authentic 3D Video Calls from Live Gaussian Splat Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21311)
*Martin de La Gorce,Charlie Hewitt,Tibor Takacs,Robert Gerdisch,Zafiirah Hosenie,Givi Meishvili,Marek Kowalski,Thomas J. Cashman,Antonio Criminisi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种从单目2D摄像头实时生成高质量3D高斯重建的方法，适用于3D视频会议，具有高真实性和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D会议解决方案依赖复杂硬件或固定外观，限制了视频会议的应用。本文旨在提供一种无需复杂设备、实时且真实的3D重建方法。

Method: 通过独立处理每帧视频，生成3D高斯重建，并引入稳定性损失函数确保时间一致性。

Result: 方法在视觉质量和稳定性指标上优于现有技术，并在标准2D设备上实现了实时3D会议。

Conclusion: 该方法为3D视频会议提供了高度可访问、真实且稳定的解决方案。

Abstract: Virtual 3D meetings offer the potential to enhance copresence, increase
engagement and thus improve effectiveness of remote meetings compared to
standard 2D video calls. However, representing people in 3D meetings remains a
challenge; existing solutions achieve high quality by using complex hardware,
making use of fixed appearance via enrolment, or by inverting a pre-trained
generative model. These approaches lead to constraints that are unwelcome and
ill-fitting for videoconferencing applications. We present the first method to
predict 3D Gaussian reconstructions in real time from a single 2D webcam feed,
where the 3D representation is not only live and realistic, but also authentic
to the input video. By conditioning the 3D representation on each video frame
independently, our reconstruction faithfully recreates the input video from the
captured viewpoint (a property we call authenticity), while generalizing
realistically to novel viewpoints. Additionally, we introduce a stability loss
to obtain reconstructions that are temporally stable on video sequences. We
show that our method delivers state-of-the-art accuracy in visual quality and
stability metrics compared to existing methods, and demonstrate our approach in
live one-to-one 3D meetings using only a standard 2D camera and display. This
demonstrates that our approach can allow anyone to communicate volumetrically,
via a method for 3D videoconferencing that is not only highly accessible, but
also realistic and authentic.

### [4] [ChartM$^3$: Benchmarking Chart Editing with Multimodal Instructions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21167)
*Danglu Yang,Liang Zhang,Zihao Yue,Liangyu Chen,Yichen Xu,Wenxuan Wang,Qin Jin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合自然语言和视觉指示的多模态图表编辑范式，并构建了ChartM3基准和训练集，显著提升了多模态大语言模型的图表编辑能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图表编辑方法主要依赖自然语言指令，但这类指令通常模糊，难以支持细粒度编辑。

Method: 引入多模态图表编辑范式，结合自然语言和视觉指示；构建ChartM3基准和训练集ChartM3-Train。

Result: ChartM3揭示了当前多模态大语言模型（如GPT-4o）在视觉指示理解上的局限性；通过训练集微调模型，性能显著提升。

Conclusion: 多模态监督对构建实用图表编辑系统至关重要，ChartM3为相关研究提供了数据和工具支持。

Abstract: Charts are a fundamental visualization format widely used in data analysis
across research and industry. While enabling users to edit charts based on
high-level intentions is of great practical value, existing methods primarily
rely on natural language instructions, which are often too ambiguous to support
fine-grained editing. In this work, we introduce a novel paradigm for
multimodal chart editing, where user intent is expressed through a combination
of natural language and visual indicators that explicitly highlight the
elements to be modified. To support this paradigm, we present
Chart$\text{M}^3$, a new benchmark for Multimodal chart editing with
Multi-level complexity and Multi-perspective evaluation. Chart$\text{M}^3$
contains 1,000 samples spanning four levels of editing difficulty. Each sample
includes triplets in the form of (chart, code, multimodal instructions). To
comprehensively evaluate chart editing models, Chart$\text{M}^3$ provides
metrics that assess both visual appearance and code correctness. Our benchmark
reveals significant limitations in current multimodal large language models
(MLLMs), including GPT-4o, particularly in their ability to interpret and act
on visual indicators. To address this, we construct Chart$\text{M}^3$-Train, a
large-scale training set with 24,000 multimodal chart editing samples.
Fine-tuning MLLMs on this dataset leads to substantial improvements,
demonstrating the importance of multimodal supervision in building practical
chart editing systems. Our datasets, codes, and evaluation tools are available

### [5] [PanoGAN A Deep Generative Model for Panoramic Dental Radiographs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21200)
*Soren Pedersen,Sanyam Jain,Mikkel Chavez,Viktor Ladehoff,Bruna Neves de Freitas,Ruben Pauwels*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文开发了一种用于合成牙科全景X光片的生成对抗网络（GAN），旨在解决牙科研究和教育中数据稀缺的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 牙科研究和教育中数据稀缺，需要一种方法来生成高质量的牙科全景X光片。

Method: 使用Wasserstein损失和梯度惩罚（WGANGP）训练深度卷积GAN（DCGAN），对2322张质量不一的X光片进行预处理和裁剪，专注于牙槽区域。探索了四种候选模型，调整了批评器迭代次数、特征深度和去噪处理。

Result: 生成的X光片在解剖可视性和真实性上表现中等，部分图像存在伪影。未去噪数据的模型在细节（如下颌管和骨小梁）上更优，而去噪数据的模型在整体清晰度和锐度上更佳。

Conclusion: 研究为未来基于GAN的牙科影像方法奠定了基础。

Abstract: This paper presents the development of a generative adversarial network (GAN)
for synthesizing dental panoramic radiographs. Although exploratory in nature,
the study aims to address the scarcity of data in dental research and
education. We trained a deep convolutional GAN (DCGAN) using a Wasserstein loss
with gradient penalty (WGANGP) on a dataset of 2322 radiographs of varying
quality. The focus was on the dentoalveolar regions, other anatomical
structures were cropped out. Extensive preprocessing and data cleaning were
performed to standardize the inputs while preserving anatomical variability. We
explored four candidate models by varying critic iterations, feature depth, and
the use of denoising prior to training. A clinical expert evaluated the
generated radiographs based on anatomical visibility and realism, using a
5-point scale (1 very poor 5 excellent). Most images showed moderate anatomical
depiction, although some were degraded by artifacts. A trade-off was observed
the model trained on non-denoised data yielded finer details especially in
structures like the mandibular canal and trabecular bone, while a model trained
on denoised data offered superior overall image clarity and sharpness. These
findings provide a foundation for future work on GAN-based methods in dental
imaging.

### [6] [On Explaining Visual Captioning with Hybrid Markov Logic Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21246)
*Monika Shah,Somdeb Sarkhel,Deepak Venugopal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于混合马尔可夫逻辑网络（HMLNs）的可解释框架，用于分析深度神经网络在多模态任务（如图像描述）中的信息整合方式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有性能评估指标无法深入揭示模型如何整合视觉、语言和知识表示以生成有意义的描述，因此需要一种更直观的解释方法。

Method: 通过学习训练实例的HMLN分布，并在生成样本条件下推断分布变化，量化哪些训练实例对生成描述提供了更丰富的信息。

Result: 实验表明，该框架能直观解释多种先进图像描述模型的生成过程，并比较其可解释性。

Conclusion: 该框架为深度神经网络在多模态任务中的解释提供了一种新方法，增强了模型的可解释性。

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have made tremendous progress in multimodal tasks
such as image captioning. However, explaining/interpreting how these models
integrate visual information, language information and knowledge representation
to generate meaningful captions remains a challenging problem. Standard metrics
to measure performance typically rely on comparing generated captions with
human-written ones that may not provide a user with a deep insights into this
integration. In this work, we develop a novel explanation framework that is
easily interpretable based on Hybrid Markov Logic Networks (HMLNs) - a language
that can combine symbolic rules with real-valued functions - where we
hypothesize how relevant examples from the training data could have influenced
the generation of the observed caption. To do this, we learn a HMLN
distribution over the training instances and infer the shift in distributions
over these instances when we condition on the generated sample which allows us
to quantify which examples may have been a source of richer information to
generate the observed caption. Our experiments on captions generated for
several state-of-the-art captioning models using Amazon Mechanical Turk
illustrate the interpretability of our explanations, and allow us to compare
these models along the dimension of explainability.

### [7] [Dual Guidance Semi-Supervised Action Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21247)
*Ankit Singh,Efstratios Gavves,Cees G. M. Snoek,Hilde Kuehne*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于时空动作定位的半监督学习方法，通过双引导网络选择更好的伪边界框，显著提升了有限标注数据下的模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 半监督学习在图像分类中已有广泛应用，但在时空动作定位领域的研究较少，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 引入双引导网络，结合帧级分类和边界框预测，确保动作类别在帧和边界框之间的一致性。

Result: 在UCF101-24、J-HMDB-21和AVA数据集上评估，模型在有限标注数据下表现优异，优于基于图像的半监督基线方法。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在时空动作定位任务中显著提升了半监督学习的性能，为相关领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) has shown tremendous potential to improve the
predictive performance of deep learning models when annotations are hard to
obtain. However, the application of SSL has so far been mainly studied in the
context of image classification. In this work, we present a semi-supervised
approach for spatial-temporal action localization. We introduce a dual guidance
network to select better pseudo-bounding boxes. It combines a frame-level
classification with a bounding-box prediction to enforce action class
consistency across frames and boxes. Our evaluation across well-known
spatial-temporal action localization datasets, namely UCF101-24 , J-HMDB-21 and
AVA shows that the proposed module considerably enhances the model's
performance in limited labeled data settings. Our framework achieves superior
results compared to extended image-based semi-supervised baselines.

*Christopher Indris,Raiyan Rahman,Goetz Bramesfeld,Guanghui Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文研究了航空野生动物追踪中的小目标检测问题，通过数据增强和比较三种目标检测模型，发现简单快速的模型在有限计算资源下表现良好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 航空野生动物追踪需要高效的小目标检测方法，但传统方法成本高且计算资源有限。

Method: 采用数据增强（分块）方法，比较三种不同架构的目标检测模型，分析超参数对检测精度的影响。

Result: 所有模型在至少一种分块配置下达到93%以上的mAP@IoU=0.5，简单模型表现与复杂模型相当。

Conclusion: 研究支持在无人机上部署简单高效的模型，适用于资源有限的小目标检测任务。

Abstract: Aerial wildlife tracking is critical for conservation efforts and relies on
detecting small objects on the ground below the aircraft. It presents technical
challenges: crewed aircraft are expensive, risky and disruptive; autonomous
drones have limited computational capacity for onboard AI systems. Since the
objects of interest may appear only a few pixels wide, small object detection
is an inherently challenging computer vision subfield compounded by
computational efficiency needs. This paper applies a patching augmentation to
datasets to study model performance under various settings. A comparative study
of three common yet architecturally diverse object detectors is conducted using
the data, varying the patching method's hyperparameters against detection
accuracy. Each model achieved at least 93\% mAP@IoU=0.5 on at least one
patching configuration. Statistical analyses provide an in-depth commentary on
the effects of various factors. Analysis also shows that faster, simpler models
are about as effective as models that require more computational power for this
task and perform well given limited patch scales, encouraging UAV deployment.

### [9] [HDR Environment Map Estimation with Latent Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21261)
*Jack Hilliard,Adrian Hilton,Jean-Yves Guillemaut*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于潜在扩散模型（LDM）的新方法，用于从单视图图像生成高质量的HDR环境贴图，解决了ERP表示中的边界伪影问题，并通过全景适应扩散变换器（PanoDiT）进一步优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统ERP表示在环境贴图中存在的极地扭曲和边界接缝问题，提升镜像反射表面的光照效果。

Method: 使用潜在自编码器中的ERP卷积填充消除边界伪影，并提出全景适应扩散变换器（PanoDiT）以减少ERP失真。

Result: 模型在标准基准测试中表现优异，生成的环境贴图在图像质量和光照准确性上与最先进方法竞争。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了ERP表示的局限性，生成了高质量的环境贴图，但在图像质量和真实性之间存在权衡。

Abstract: We advance the field of HDR environment map estimation from a single-view
image by establishing a novel approach leveraging the Latent Diffusion Model
(LDM) to produce high-quality environment maps that can plausibly light
mirror-reflective surfaces. A common issue when using the ERP representation,
the format used by the vast majority of approaches, is distortions at the poles
and a seam at the sides of the environment map. We remove the border seam
artefact by proposing an ERP convolutional padding in the latent autoencoder.
Additionally, we investigate whether adapting the diffusion network
architecture to the ERP format can improve the quality and accuracy of the
estimated environment map by proposing a panoramically-adapted Diffusion
Transformer architecture. Our proposed PanoDiT network reduces ERP distortions
and artefacts, but at the cost of image quality and plausibility. We evaluate
with standard benchmarks to demonstrate that our models estimate high-quality
environment maps that perform competitively with state-of-the-art approaches in
both image quality and lighting accuracy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究评估了六种基于CLIP的模型在胸部X光分类中的公平性和鲁棒性，发现不同年龄患者间存在性能差距，但对其他属性表现较公平。模型对无胸引管的图像表现较差，表明依赖虚假相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于CLIP的模型在医学任务中表现良好，但其公平性和鲁棒性尚未充分探索。

Method: 使用MIMIC-CXR、NIH-CXR14和NEATX三个公开数据集，评估模型在六种条件和患者亚组（年龄、性别、种族）中的公平性，并分析对胸引管的鲁棒性。

Result: 不同年龄患者间存在性能差距，其他属性表现较公平；模型对无胸引管的图像表现较差。

Conclusion: 模型在公平性和鲁棒性方面存在改进空间，需进一步研究以减少虚假相关性依赖。

Abstract: Motivated by the strong performance of CLIP-based models in natural
image-text domains, recent efforts have adapted these architectures to medical
tasks, particularly in radiology, where large paired datasets of images and
reports, such as chest X-rays, are available. While these models have shown
encouraging results in terms of accuracy and discriminative performance, their
fairness and robustness in the different clinical tasks remain largely
underexplored. In this study, we extensively evaluate six widely used
CLIP-based models on chest X-ray classification using three publicly available
datasets: MIMIC-CXR, NIH-CXR14, and NEATX. We assess the models fairness across
six conditions and patient subgroups based on age, sex, and race. Additionally,
we assess the robustness to shortcut learning by evaluating performance on
pneumothorax cases with and without chest drains. Our results indicate
performance gaps between patients of different ages, but more equitable results
for the other attributes. Moreover, all models exhibit lower performance on
images without chest drains, suggesting reliance on spurious correlations. We
further complement the performance analysis with a study of the embeddings
generated by the models. While the sensitive attributes could be classified
from the embeddings, we do not see such patterns using PCA, showing the
limitations of these visualisation techniques when assessing models. Our code
is available at https://github.com/TheoSourget/clip_cxr_fairness

### [11] [GLCP: Global-to-Local Connectivity Preservation for Tubular Structure Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21328)
*Feixiang Zhou,Zhuangzhi Gao,He Zhao,Jianyang Xie,Yanda Meng,Yitian Zhao,Gregory Y. H. Lip,Yalin Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种全局到局部连通性保持（GLCP）框架，用于管状结构分割，解决了现有方法忽视局部不连续区域的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 管状结构（如血管网络）的准确分割在医学领域至关重要，但现有方法常忽略局部不连续区域，导致分割效果不佳。

Method: 提出GLCP框架，包含交互式多头分割（IMS）模块和基于双注意力的轻量级细化（DAR）模块，同时感知全局和局部结构特征。

Result: 在2D和3D数据集上实验表明，GLCP在管状结构分割中优于现有方法，实现了更高的准确性和连续性。

Conclusion: GLCP框架通过全局与局部特征的联合学习，显著提升了管状结构的分割效果。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of tubular structures, such as vascular networks, plays
a critical role in various medical domains. A remaining significant challenge
in this task is structural fragmentation, which can adversely impact downstream
applications. Existing methods primarily focus on designing various loss
functions to constrain global topological structures. However, they often
overlook local discontinuity regions, leading to suboptimal segmentation
results. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel Global-to-Local
Connectivity Preservation (GLCP) framework that can simultaneously perceive
global and local structural characteristics of tubular networks. Specifically,
we propose an Interactive Multi-head Segmentation (IMS) module to jointly learn
global segmentation, skeleton maps, and local discontinuity maps, respectively.
This enables our model to explicitly target local discontinuity regions while
maintaining global topological integrity. In addition, we design a lightweight
Dual-Attention-based Refinement (DAR) module to further improve segmentation
quality by refining the resulting segmentation maps. Extensive experiments on
both 2D and 3D datasets demonstrate that our GLCP achieves superior accuracy
and continuity in tubular structure segmentation compared to several
state-of-the-art approaches. The source codes will be available at
https://github.com/FeixiangZhou/GLCP.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究探讨了视觉语言模型（VLMs）在违反Grice合作原则时的表现，发现其性能随修饰语的增加而下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索VLMs是否能像人类一样处理违反Grice对话原则的情况，以理解其局限性。

Method: 在VQA v2.0数据集上，对GPT-4o、Claude-3.5-Sonnet和Gemini-1.5-Flash三种VLMs添加修饰语，分析其响应。

Result: VLMs的性能随修饰语的增加而下降。

Conclusion: 该方法有助于理解VLMs的局限性。

Abstract: We can think of Visual Question Answering as a (multimodal) conversation
between a human and an AI system. Here, we explore the sensitivity of Vision
Language Models (VLMs) through the lens of cooperative principles of
conversation proposed by Grice. Specifically, even when Grice's maxims of
conversation are flouted, humans typically do not have much difficulty in
understanding the conversation even though it requires more cognitive effort.
Here, we study if VLMs are capable of handling violations to Grice's maxims in
a manner that is similar to humans. Specifically, we add modifiers to
human-crafted questions and analyze the response of VLMs to these modifiers. We
use three state-of-the-art VLMs in our study, namely, GPT-4o, Claude-3.5-Sonnet
and Gemini-1.5-Flash on questions from the VQA v2.0 dataset. Our initial
results seem to indicate that the performance of VLMs consistently diminish
with the addition of modifiers which indicates our approach as a promising
direction to understand the limitations of VLMs.

Result: 在定量指标上优于现有方法（p < 0.05），下游脑分割任务精度提升，重建时间大幅减少。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且适用于实时临床应用，代码已开源。

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a crucial medical imaging modality.
However, long acquisition times remain a significant challenge, leading to
increased costs, and reduced patient comfort. Recent studies have shown the
potential of using deep learning models that incorporate information from prior
subject-specific MRI scans to improve reconstruction quality of present scans.
Integrating this prior information requires registration of the previous scan
to the current image reconstruction, which can be time-consuming. We propose a
novel deep-learning-based MRI reconstruction framework which consists of an
initial reconstruction network, a deep registration model, and a
transformer-based enhancement network. We validated our method on a
longitudinal dataset of T1-weighted MRI scans with 2,808 images from 18
subjects at four acceleration factors (R5, R10, R15, R20). Quantitative metrics
confirmed our approach's superiority over existing methods (p < 0.05, Wilcoxon
signed-rank test). Furthermore, we analyzed the impact of our MRI
reconstruction method on the downstream task of brain segmentation and observed
improved accuracy and volumetric agreement with reference segmentations. Our
approach also achieved a substantial reduction in total reconstruction time
compared to methods that use traditional registration algorithms, making it
more suitable for real-time clinical applications. The code associated with
this work is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型视频语言模型在少量示例下进行动作检测时面临的过拟合和场景级预训练与人物中心理解之间的粒度不匹配问题。

Method: 结合LoRA参数高效调优和可学习内部特征增强（通过FiLM实现），并引入动态调整训练贡献的组加权损失函数。

Result: 在复杂多标签、多人动作检测数据集（AVA、MOMA）上表现出色，实现了高mAP性能，并展示了从有限示例中适应VLM的显著数据效率。

Conclusion: 该方法通过特征增强和动态损失函数，有效提升了VLM在动作检测任务中的适应性和性能。

Abstract: Adapting large Video-Language Models (VLMs) for action detection using only a
few examples poses challenges like overfitting and the granularity mismatch
between scene-level pre-training and required person-centric understanding. We
propose an efficient adaptation strategy combining parameter-efficient tuning
(LoRA) with a novel learnable internal feature augmentation. Applied within the
frozen VLM backbone using FiLM, these augmentations generate diverse feature
variations directly relevant to the task. Additionally, we introduce a
group-weighted loss function that dynamically modulates the training
contribution of each augmented sample based on its prediction divergence
relative to the group average. This promotes robust learning by prioritizing
informative yet reasonable augmentations. We demonstrate our method's
effectiveness on complex multi-label, multi-person action detection datasets
(AVA, MOMA), achieving strong mAP performance and showcasing significant data
efficiency for adapting VLMs from limited examples.

significantly in autonomous driving by offering cost-effectiveness and rich
contextual information. However, existing methods often construct BEV
representations by collapsing extracted object features, neglecting intrinsic
environmental contexts, such as roads and pavements. This hinders detectors
from comprehensively perceiving the characteristics of the physical world. To
alleviate this, we introduce a multi-task learning framework, Collaborative
Perceiver (CoP), that leverages spatial occupancy as auxiliary information to
mine consistent structural and conceptual similarities shared between 3D object
detection and occupancy prediction tasks, bridging gaps in spatial
representations and feature refinement. To this end, we first propose a
pipeline to generate dense occupancy ground truths incorporating local density
information (LDO) for reconstructing detailed environmental information. Next,
we employ a voxel-height-guided sampling (VHS) strategy to distill fine-grained
local features according to distinct object properties. Furthermore, we develop
a global-local collaborative feature fusion (CFF) module that seamlessly
integrates complementary knowledge between both tasks, thus composing more
robust BEV representations. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes benchmark
demonstrate that CoP outperforms existing vision-based frameworks, achieving
49.5\% mAP and 59.2\% NDS on the test set. Code and supplementary materials are

Abstract: Wildlife populations in Africa face severe threats, with vertebrate numbers
declining by over 65% in the past five decades. In response, image
classification using deep learning has emerged as a promising tool for
biodiversity monitoring and conservation. This paper presents a comparative
study of deep learning models for automatically classifying African wildlife
images, focusing on transfer learning with frozen feature extractors. Using a
public dataset of four species: buffalo, elephant, rhinoceros, and zebra; we
evaluate the performance of DenseNet-201, ResNet-152, EfficientNet-B4, and
Vision Transformer ViT-H/14. DenseNet-201 achieved the best performance among
convolutional networks (67% accuracy), while ViT-H/14 achieved the highest
overall accuracy (99%), but with significantly higher computational cost,
raising deployment concerns. Our experiments highlight the trade-offs between
accuracy, resource requirements, and deployability. The best-performing CNN
(DenseNet-201) was integrated into a Hugging Face Gradio Space for real-time
field use, demonstrating the feasibility of deploying lightweight models in
conservation settings. This work contributes to African-grounded AI research by
offering practical insights into model selection, dataset preparation, and
responsible deployment of deep learning tools for wildlife conservation.

TL;DR: PDAF是一种概率扩散对齐框架，通过引入潜在域先验（LDP）来捕获域偏移，并利用扩散模型提升分割网络的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决域广义语义分割（DGSS）中因域偏移导致的模型性能下降问题，现有方法常忽略潜在域先验。

Method: PDAF包含三个模块：LPE预测LDP，DCM调整特征表示，DPE通过扩散过程估计LDP。

Result: 实验验证PDAF在多样化城市场景中的有效性。

Conclusion: PDAF通过迭代建模域偏移，显著提升了模型在复杂目标条件下的泛化能力。

Abstract: Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation (DGSS) is a critical yet challenging
task, as domain shifts in unseen environments can severely compromise model
performance. While recent studies enhance feature alignment by projecting
features into the source domain, they often neglect intrinsic latent domain
priors, leading to suboptimal results. In this paper, we introduce PDAF, a
Probabilistic Diffusion Alignment Framework that enhances the generalization of
existing segmentation networks through probabilistic diffusion modeling. PDAF
introduces a Latent Domain Prior (LDP) to capture domain shifts and uses this
prior as a conditioning factor to align both source and unseen target domains.
To achieve this, PDAF integrates into a pre-trained segmentation model and
utilizes paired source and pseudo-target images to simulate latent domain
shifts, enabling LDP modeling. The framework comprises three modules: the
Latent Prior Extractor (LPE) predicts the LDP by supervising domain shifts; the
Domain Compensation Module (DCM) adjusts feature representations to mitigate
domain shifts; and the Diffusion Prior Estimator (DPE) leverages a diffusion
process to estimate the LDP without requiring paired samples. This design
enables PDAF to iteratively model domain shifts, progressively refining feature
representations to enhance generalization under complex target conditions.
Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of PDAF across diverse and
challenging urban scenes.

Motivation: 从2D俯视图生成360度室内全景图在虚拟现实、室内设计等领域有广泛应用，但由于缺乏明确的3D结构和几何一致性要求，这一任务具有挑战性。

Method: Top2Pano通过估计体积占用率推断3D结构，使用体积渲染生成粗糙的颜色和深度全景图，再通过ControlNet进行扩散细化。

Abstract: Generating immersive 360{\deg} indoor panoramas from 2D top-down views has
applications in virtual reality, interior design, real estate, and robotics.
This task is challenging due to the lack of explicit 3D structure and the need
for geometric consistency and photorealism. We propose Top2Pano, an end-to-end
model for synthesizing realistic indoor panoramas from top-down views. Our
method estimates volumetric occupancy to infer 3D structures, then uses
volumetric rendering to generate coarse color and depth panoramas. These guide
a diffusion-based refinement stage using ControlNet, enhancing realism and
structural fidelity. Evaluations on two datasets show Top2Pano outperforms
baselines, effectively reconstructing geometry, occlusions, and spatial
arrangements. It also generalizes well, producing high-quality panoramas from
schematic floorplans. Our results highlight Top2Pano's potential in bridging
top-down views with immersive indoor synthesis.

TL;DR: LLaVA-Reward是一个高效的奖励模型，利用预训练的多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）自动评估文本到图像（T2I）生成的多方面质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于MLLM的方法需要指令跟随数据进行监督微调，且评估生成质量时依赖文本响应分析，耗时且难以训练。

Method: LLaVA-Reward直接利用MLLMs的隐藏状态处理文本-图像对，并引入Skip-connection Cross Attention（SkipCA）模块增强视觉与文本表征的双向交互。

Result: LLaVA-Reward在文本-图像对齐、保真度/伪影、安全性和整体排名四个评估维度上表现优于传统和基于MLLM的方法。

Conclusion: LLaVA-Reward在自动评估和推理时扩展方面生成与人类对齐的评分，具有高效性和优越性。

Abstract: We introduce LLaVA-Reward, an efficient reward model designed to
automatically evaluate text-to-image (T2I) generations across multiple
perspectives, leveraging pretrained multimodal large language models (MLLMs).
Existing MLLM-based approaches require instruction-following data for
supervised fine-tuning and evaluate generation quality on analyzing text
response, which is time-consuming and difficult to train. To address this
problem, we propose LLaVA-Reward, which directly utilizes the hidden states of
MLLMs given text-image pairs. To enhance the bidirectional interaction between
visual and textual representations in decoder-only MLLMs, we further propose
adding a Skip-connection Cross Attention (SkipCA) module. This design enhances
text-image correlation reasoning by connecting early-layer visual features with
later-layer hidden representations.In addition, LLaVA-Reward supports different
types of preference data for efficient fine-tuning, including paired preference
data and unpaired data. We train LLaVA-Reward on four evaluation perspectives:
text-image alignment, fidelity/artifact, safety, and overall ranking. Empirical
results demonstrate that LLaVA-Reward outperforms conventional and MLLM-based
methods in generating human-aligned scores for automatic evaluations and
inference-time scaling in text-to-image generations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要针对推理阶段，训练阶段效率提升有限，ReGATE旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用教师-学生框架，结合参考损失和学生难度评分，选择性处理关键令牌。

Result: 在VideoLLaMA2上，ReGATE达到标准训练峰值精度，速度提升2倍，令牌使用量减少35%。

Conclusion: ReGATE在减少令牌数量的同时，性能超越基线，展示了高效训练MLLM的潜力。

Abstract: The computational cost of training multimodal large language models (MLLMs)
rapidly increases with the number of tokens involved. Existing efficiency
methods primarily target inference and rely on token reduction or merging,
offering limited benefit during training. In this paper, we propose ReGATE
(Reference$-$Guided Adaptive Token Elision), an adaptive token pruning method
for accelerating MLLM training. Specifically, ReGATE adopts a teacher-student
framework in which the MLLM being trained serves as the student, and a frozen
reference large language model (LLM) acts as the teacher. The teacher computes
per-token reference losses, which are combined with an exponential moving
average (EMA) of the student's own difficulty scores. This adaptive
difficulty-based scoring enables the selective processing of crucial tokens
while bypassing less informative ones in the forward pass, significantly
reducing computational overhead. Experiments demonstrate that ReGATE, when
applied to VideoLLaMA2, matches the peak accuracy of standard training on
MVBench up to 2$\times$ faster, using only 35% of the tokens. With additional
training, it even surpasses the baseline on several multimodal benchmarks, all
while reducing the total token count by over 41%. Code and models will be
released soon.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统地图构建模型仅提供确定性点估计，无法处理现实环境中的模糊性（如遮挡和缺失车道标记）。

Method: 利用扩散模型迭代优化随机初始化的查询，基于BEV潜在网格生成多个可能的地图样本。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上，MapDiffusion在在线地图构建中表现优于基线5%，多样本聚合进一步提升了性能。

Conclusion: MapDiffusion通过建模全分布，增强了在线向量化高清地图构建的鲁棒性和可靠性，支持自动驾驶在复杂环境中的不确定性感知决策。

Abstract: Autonomous driving requires an understanding of the static environment from
sensor data. Learned Bird's-Eye View (BEV) encoders are commonly used to fuse
multiple inputs, and a vector decoder predicts a vectorized map representation
from the latent BEV grid. However, traditional map construction models provide
deterministic point estimates, failing to capture uncertainty and the inherent
ambiguities of real-world environments, such as occlusions and missing lane
markings. We propose MapDiffusion, a novel generative approach that leverages
the diffusion paradigm to learn the full distribution of possible vectorized
maps. Instead of predicting a single deterministic output from learned queries,
MapDiffusion iteratively refines randomly initialized queries, conditioned on a
BEV latent grid, to generate multiple plausible map samples. This allows
aggregating samples to improve prediction accuracy and deriving uncertainty
estimates that directly correlate with scene ambiguity. Extensive experiments
on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that MapDiffusion achieves state-of-the-art
performance in online map construction, surpassing the baseline by 5% in
single-sample performance. We further show that aggregating multiple samples
consistently improves performance along the ROC curve, validating the benefit
of distribution modeling. Additionally, our uncertainty estimates are
significantly higher in occluded areas, reinforcing their value in identifying
regions with ambiguous sensor input. By modeling the full map distribution,
MapDiffusion enhances the robustness and reliability of online vectorized HD
map construction, enabling uncertainty-aware decision-making for autonomous
vehicles in complex environments.

Motivation: 现有半监督学习方法在医学图像分割中主要依赖像素级一致性训练，忽视了区域级语义一致性，且因标记与未标记数据数量不平衡导致特征差异。

Result: 在四个数据集上的实验表明，DuCiSC在分割性能上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DuCiSC通过跨图像语义一致性学习和自感知策略，显著提升了半监督医学图像分割的效果。

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning has proven highly effective in tackling the
challenge of limited labeled training data in medical image segmentation. In
general, current approaches, which rely on intra-image pixel-wise consistency
training via pseudo-labeling, overlook the consistency at more comprehensive
semantic levels (e.g., object region) and suffer from severe discrepancy of
extracted features resulting from an imbalanced number of labeled and unlabeled
data. To overcome these limitations, we present a new \underline{Du}al
\underline{C}ross-\underline{i}mage \underline{S}emantic
\underline{C}onsistency (DuCiSC) learning framework, for semi-supervised
medical image segmentation. Concretely, beyond enforcing pixel-wise semantic
consistency, DuCiSC proposes dual paradigms to encourage region-level semantic
consistency across: 1) labeled and unlabeled images; and 2) labeled and fused
images, by explicitly aligning their prototypes. Relying on the dual paradigms,
DuCiSC can effectively establish consistent cross-image semantics via prototype
representations, thereby addressing the feature discrepancy issue. Moreover, we
devise a novel self-aware confidence estimation strategy to accurately select
reliable pseudo labels, allowing for exploiting the training dynamics of
unlabeled data. Our DuCiSC method is extensively validated on four datasets,
including two popular binary benchmarks in segmenting the left atrium and
pancreas, a multi-class Automatic Cardiac Diagnosis Challenge dataset, and a
challenging scenario of segmenting the inferior alveolar nerve that features
complicated anatomical structures, showing superior segmentation results over
previous state-of-the-art approaches. Our code is publicly available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的视觉语言导航策略，通过递归总结视觉感知并自适应对齐语言命令，解决了当前方法中场景表示过于详细和视觉语言对齐模糊的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言导航代理在场景表示和视觉语言对齐方面存在问题，导致导航决策不准确。

Method: 提出递归视觉想象（RVI）技术和自适应语言对齐（ALG）技术，分别用于建模历史轨迹和增强语言对齐。

Result: 新方法在VLN-CE和ObjectNav任务上优于现有技术。

Conclusion: RVI和ALG技术显著提升了视觉语言导航的性能。

Abstract: Vision Language Navigation (VLN) typically requires agents to navigate to
specified objects or remote regions in unknown scenes by obeying linguistic
commands. Such tasks require organizing historical visual observations for
linguistic grounding, which is critical for long-sequence navigational
decisions. However, current agents suffer from overly detailed scene
representation and ambiguous vision-language alignment, which weaken their
comprehension of navigation-friendly high-level scene priors and easily lead to
behaviors that violate linguistic commands. To tackle these issues, we propose
a navigation policy by recursively summarizing along-the-way visual
perceptions, which are adaptively aligned with commands to enhance linguistic
grounding. In particular, by structurally modeling historical trajectories as
compact neural grids, several Recursive Visual Imagination (RVI) techniques are
proposed to motivate agents to focus on the regularity of visual transitions
and semantic scene layouts, instead of dealing with misleading geometric
details. Then, an Adaptive Linguistic Grounding (ALG) technique is proposed to
align the learned situational memories with different linguistic components
purposefully. Such fine-grained semantic matching facilitates the accurate
anticipation of navigation actions and progress. Our navigation policy
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the challenging VLN-CE and
ObjectNav tasks, showing the superiority of our RVI and ALG techniques for VLN.

Conclusion: 自监督数据集蒸馏方法通过创新技术有效提取数据集的关键信息，生成更紧凑且泛化能力强的蒸馏集。

Abstract: Although larger datasets are crucial for training large deep models, the
rapid growth of dataset size has brought a significant challenge in terms of
considerable training costs, which even results in prohibitive computational
expenses. Dataset Distillation becomes a popular technique recently to reduce
the dataset size via learning a highly compact set of representative exemplars,
where the model trained with these exemplars ideally should have comparable
performance with respect to the one trained with the full dataset. While most
of existing works upon dataset distillation focus on supervised datasets, we
instead aim to distill images and their self-supervisedly trained
representations into a distilled set. This procedure, named as Self-Supervised
Dataset Distillation, effectively extracts rich information from real datasets,
yielding the distilled sets with enhanced cross-architecture generalizability.
Particularly, in order to preserve the key characteristics of original dataset
more faithfully and compactly, several novel techniques are proposed: 1) we
introduce an innovative parameterization upon images and representations via
distinct low-dimensional bases, where the base selection for parameterization
is experimentally shown to play a crucial role; 2) we tackle the instability
induced by the randomness of data augmentation -- a key component in
self-supervised learning but being underestimated in the prior work of
self-supervised dataset distillation -- by utilizing predetermined
augmentations; 3) we further leverage a lightweight network to model the
connections among the representations of augmented views from the same image,
leading to more compact pairs of distillation. Extensive experiments conducted
on various datasets validate the superiority of our approach in terms of
distillation efficiency, cross-architecture generalization, and transfer
learning performance.

Conclusion: 该方法通过高质量的光场角-时域建模，显著提升了低光场景下的目标跟踪效果。

Abstract: High-quality 4D light field representation with efficient angular feature
modeling is crucial for scene perception, as it can provide discriminative
spatial-angular cues to identify moving targets. However, recent developments
still struggle to deliver reliable angular modeling in the temporal domain,
particularly in complex low-light scenes. In this paper, we propose a novel
light field epipolar-plane structure image (ESI) representation that explicitly
defines the geometric structure within the light field. By capitalizing on the
abrupt changes in the angles of light rays within the epipolar plane, this
representation can enhance visual expression in low-light scenes and reduce
redundancy in high-dimensional light fields. We further propose an
angular-temporal interaction network (ATINet) for light field object tracking
that learns angular-aware representations from the geometric structural cues
and angular-temporal interaction cues of light fields. Furthermore, ATINet can
also be optimized in a self-supervised manner to enhance the geometric feature
interaction across the temporal domain. Finally, we introduce a large-scale
light field low-light dataset for object tracking. Extensive experimentation
demonstrates that ATINet achieves state-of-the-art performance in single object
tracking. Furthermore, we extend the proposed method to multiple object
tracking, which also shows the effectiveness of high-quality light field
angular-temporal modeling.

Conclusion: 强化学习在机器人学习中的在线交互经验对扩展基础模型能力至关重要。

Abstract: Navigation foundation models trained on massive webscale data enable agents
to generalize across diverse environments and embodiments. However, these
models trained solely on offline data, often lack the capacity to reason about
the consequences of their actions or adapt through counterfactual
understanding. They thus face significant limitations in the real-world urban
navigation where interactive and safe behaviors, such as avoiding obstacles and
moving pedestrians, are critical. To tackle these challenges, we introduce the
Seeing-to-Experiencing framework to scale the capability of navigation
foundation models with reinforcement learning. S2E combines the strengths of
pre-training on videos and post-training through RL. It maintains the
generalizability acquired from large-scale real-world videos while enhancing
its interactivity through RL in simulation environments. Specifically, we
introduce two innovations: an Anchor-Guided Distribution Matching strategy,
which stabilizes learning and models diverse motion patterns through
anchor-based supervision; and a Residual-Attention Module, which obtains
reactive behaviors from simulation environments without erasing the model's
pretrained knowledge. Moreover, we establish a comprehensive end-to-end
evaluation benchmark, NavBench-GS, built on photorealistic 3DGS reconstructions
of real-world scenes that incorporate physical interactions. It can
systematically assess the generalizability and safety of navigation foundation
models. Extensive experiments show that S2E mitigates the diminishing returns
often seen when scaling with offline data alone. We perform a thorough analysis
of the benefits of Reinforcement Learning compared to Supervised Fine-Tuning in
the context of post-training for robot learning. Our findings emphasize the
crucial role of integrating interactive online experiences to effectively scale
foundation models in Robotics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法因3D训练数据不足难以生成泛化表示，而CLIP在图像-文本对上的预训练提供了广泛泛化能力。

Method: 提出DAC框架，利用MLLM描述已知类别信息以适配CLIP，并通过AB-LoRA技术减少过拟合。

Result: 在四个开放集3DOR数据集上平均mAP提升10.01%，并在图像和跨数据集实验中验证泛化能力。

Conclusion: DAC展示了仅用多视角图像实现高效开放集3D物体检索的潜力，并显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Open-set 3D object retrieval (3DOR) is an emerging task aiming to retrieve 3D
objects of unseen categories beyond the training set. Existing methods
typically utilize all modalities (i.e., voxels, point clouds, multi-view
images) and train specific backbones before fusion. However, they still
struggle to produce generalized representations due to insufficient 3D training
data. Being contrastively pre-trained on web-scale image-text pairs, CLIP
inherently produces generalized representations for a wide range of downstream
tasks. Building upon it, we present a simple yet effective framework named
Describe, Adapt and Combine (DAC) by taking only multi-view images for open-set
3DOR. DAC innovatively synergizes a CLIP model with a multi-modal large
language model (MLLM) to learn generalized 3D representations, where the MLLM
is used for dual purposes. First, it describes the seen category information to
align with CLIP's training objective for adaptation during training. Second, it
provides external hints about unknown objects complementary to visual cues
during inference. To improve the synergy, we introduce an Additive-Bias
Low-Rank adaptation (AB-LoRA), which alleviates overfitting and further
enhances the generalization to unseen categories. With only multi-view images,
DAC significantly surpasses prior arts by an average of +10.01\% mAP on four
open-set 3DOR datasets. Moreover, its generalization is also validated on
image-based and cross-dataset setups. Code is available at

Conclusion: VAGU填补了视频异常检测领域的空白，GtS和JeAUG为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) aims to identify anomalous events in videos and
accurately determine their time intervals. Current VAD methods mainly fall into
two categories: traditional DNN-based approaches that focus on temporal
localization, and LLM-based approaches that emphasize semantic understanding.
Both anomaly understanding and grounding are essential for comprehensive video
anomaly detection and can complement each other. However, no existing model or
dataset supports both tasks simultaneously. To address this, we introduce VAGU
(Video Anomaly Grounding and Understanding), the first benchmark to integrate
both tasks. Each VAGU instance includes annotations for anomaly category,
semantic explanation, precise temporal grounding and Video QA. We also provide
multiple-choice Video QA for objective evaluation. Based on this dataset, we
propose Glance then Scrutinize (GtS), a training-free framework guided by
textual prompts. The framework first enables coarse localization of
high-probability anomalous regions, followed by detailed anomaly interpretation
and temporal boundary refinement. Additionally, we propose the JeAUG metric,
which jointly evaluates semantic interpretability and temporal precision,
overcoming the limitations of traditional metrics. Extensive experiments verify
the effectiveness of our benchmark, framework, and evaluation metric.

Abstract: Active Learning (AL) has emerged as a powerful approach for minimizing
labeling costs by selectively sampling the most informative data for neural
network model development. Effective AL for large-scale vision-language models
necessitates addressing challenges in uncertainty estimation and efficient
sampling given the vast number of parameters involved. In this work, we
introduce a novel parameter-efficient learning methodology that incorporates
uncertainty calibration loss within the AL framework. We propose a
differentiable loss function that promotes uncertainty calibration for
effectively selecting fewer and most informative data samples for fine-tuning.
Through extensive experiments across several datasets and vision backbones, we
demonstrate that our solution can match and exceed the performance of complex
feature-based sampling techniques while being computationally very efficient.
Additionally, we investigate the efficacy of Prompt learning versus Low-rank
adaptation (LoRA) in sample selection, providing a detailed comparative
analysis of these methods in the context of efficient AL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Result: 实验表明，该方法在生成连贯且语义一致的烹饪过程图像上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Chain-of-Cooking模型有效解决了烹饪过程可视化中的语义和连贯性问题。

Abstract: Cooking process visualization is a promising task in the intersection of
image generation and food analysis, which aims to generate an image for each
cooking step of a recipe. However, most existing works focus on generating
images of finished foods based on the given recipes, and face two challenges to
visualize the cooking process. First, the appearance of ingredients changes
variously across cooking steps, it is difficult to generate the correct
appearances of foods that match the textual description, leading to semantic
inconsistency. Second, the current step might depend on the operations of
previous step, it is crucial to maintain the contextual coherence of images in
sequential order. In this work, we present a cooking process visualization
model, called Chain-of-Cooking. Specifically, to generate correct appearances
of ingredients, we present a Dynamic Patch Selection Module to retrieve
previously generated image patches as references, which are most related to
current textual contents. Furthermore, to enhance the coherence and keep the
rational order of generated images, we propose a Semantic Evolution Module and
a Bidirectional Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Guidance. To better utilize the
semantics of previous texts, the Semantic Evolution Module establishes the
semantical association between latent prompts and current cooking step, and
merges it with the latent features. Then the CoT Guidance updates the merged
features to guide the current cooking step remain coherent with the previous
step. Moreover, we construct a dataset named CookViz, consisting of
intermediate image-text pairs for the cooking process. Quantitative and
qualitative experiments show that our method outperforms existing methods in
generating coherent and semantic consistent cooking process.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种冲突抑制的深度伪造检测框架（CS-DFD），通过优化梯度冲突提升检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在联合训练原始和合成伪造图像时性能下降，这与直觉相悖，研究发现是梯度冲突导致。

Method: 提出CS-DFD框架，包含更新向量搜索（UVS）和冲突梯度减少（CGR）模块，分别优化梯度更新和特征嵌入。

Result: 在多个深度伪造基准测试中，CS-DFD实现了领域内检测和跨领域泛化的最佳性能。

Conclusion: CS-DFD通过抑制梯度冲突，显著提升了深度伪造检测的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Robust deepfake detection models must be capable of generalizing to
ever-evolving manipulation techniques beyond training data. A promising
strategy is to augment the training data with online synthesized fake images
containing broadly generalizable artifacts. However, in the context of deepfake
detection, it is surprising that jointly training on both original and online
synthesized forgeries may result in degraded performance. This contradicts the
common belief that incorporating more source-domain data should enhance
detection accuracy. Through empirical analysis, we trace this degradation to
gradient conflicts during backpropagation which force a trade-off between
source domain accuracy and target domain generalization. To overcome this
issue, we propose a Conflict-Suppressed Deepfake Detection (CS-DFD) framework
that explicitly mitigates the gradient conflict via two synergistic modules.
First, an Update Vector Search (UVS) module searches for an alternative update
vector near the initial gradient vector to reconcile the disparities of the
original and online synthesized forgeries. By further transforming the search
process into an extremum optimization problem, UVS yields the uniquely update
vector, which maximizes the simultaneous loss reductions for each data type.
Second, a Conflict Gradient Reduction (CGR) module enforces a low-conflict
feature embedding space through a novel Conflict Descent Loss. This loss
penalizes misaligned gradient directions and guides the learning of
representations with aligned, non-conflicting gradients. The synergy of UVS and
CGR alleviates gradient interference in both parameter optimization and
representation learning. Experiments on multiple deepfake benchmarks
demonstrate that CS-DFD achieves state-of-the-art performance in both in-domain
detection accuracy and cross-domain generalization.

Abstract: Attitude sensors determine the spacecraft attitude through the sensing of an
astronomical object, field or other phenomena. The Sun and fixed stars are the
two primary astronomical sensing objects. Attitude sensors are critical
components for the survival and knowledge improvement of spacecraft. Of these,
sun sensors are the most common and important sensor for spacecraft attitude
determination. The sun sensor measures the Sun vector in spacecraft
coordinates. The sun sensor calibration process is particularly difficult due
to the complex nature of the uncertainties involved. The uncertainties are
small, difficult to observe, and vary spatio-temporally over the lifecycle of
the sensor. In addition, the sensors are affected by numerous sources of
uncertainties, including manufacturing, electrical, environmental, and
interference sources. This motivates the development of advanced calibration
algorithms to minimize uncertainty over the sensor lifecycle and improve
accuracy. Although modeling and calibration techniques for sun sensors have
been explored extensively in the literature over the past two decades, there is
currently no resource that consolidates and systematically reviews this body of
work. The present review proposes a systematic mapping of sun sensor modeling
and calibration algorithms across a breadth of sensor configurations. It
specifically provides a comprehensive survey of each methodology, along with an
analysis of research gaps and recommendations for future directions in sun
sensor modeling and calibration techniques.

Conclusion: RelMap通过显式建模关系和语义先验，显著提升了在线地图构建的效果。

Abstract: Online high-definition (HD) map construction plays an increasingly important
role in scaling autonomous driving systems. Transformer-based methods have
become prevalent in online HD map construction; however, existing approaches
often neglect the inherent spatial and semantic relationships among map
elements, which limits their accuracy and generalization. To address this, we
propose RelMap, an end-to-end framework that enhances online map construction
by incorporating spatial relations and semantic priors. We introduce a
Class-aware Spatial Relation Prior, which explicitly encodes relative
positional dependencies between map elements using a learnable class-aware
relation encoder. Additionally, we propose a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based
Semantic Prior, which routes features to class-specific experts based on
predicted class probabilities, refining instance feature decoding. Our method
is compatible with both single-frame and temporal perception backbones,
achieving state-of-the-art performance on both the nuScenes and Argoverse 2
datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNN在资源受限平台上部署时面临尺寸和复杂性挑战，现有剪枝技术忽略特征图间的结构依赖，导致剪枝效果不佳。

Method: LinDeps利用主元QR分解检测并剪枝线性依赖的滤波器，并通过信号恢复机制调整下一层核以保持性能。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和ImageNet上的实验显示，LinDeps提高了现有剪枝技术的压缩率，同时保持性能，并在低资源设置中显著提升推理速度。

Conclusion: LinDeps是当前和未来剪枝技术的重要补充，为CNN剪枝设定了新的标准。

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are widely used in many computer vision
tasks. Yet, their increasing size and complexity pose significant challenges
for efficient deployment on resource-constrained platforms. Hence, network
pruning has emerged as an effective way of reducing the size and computational
requirements of neural networks by removing redundant or unimportant
parameters. However, a fundamental challenge with pruning consists in optimally
removing redundancies without degrading performance. Most existing pruning
techniques overlook structural dependencies across feature maps within a layer,
resulting in suboptimal pruning decisions. In this work, we introduce LinDeps,
a novel post-pruning method, i.e., a pruning method that can be applied on top
of any pruning technique, which systematically identifies and removes redundant
filters via linear dependency analysis. Particularly, LinDeps applies pivoted
QR decomposition to feature maps to detect and prune linearly dependent
filters. Then, a novel signal recovery mechanism adjusts the next layer's
kernels to preserve compatibility and performance without requiring any
fine-tuning. Our experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet with VGG and ResNet
backbones demonstrate that LinDeps improves compression rates of existing
pruning techniques while preserving performances, leading to a new state of the
art in CNN pruning. We also benchmark LinDeps in low-resource setups where no
retraining can be performed, which shows significant pruning improvements and
inference speedups over a state-of-the-art method. LinDeps therefore
constitutes an essential add-on for any current or future pruning technique.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TARS是一种新的多模态大语言模型优化策略，通过动态调整偏好信号减少幻觉，显著提升视觉语言推理的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有直接偏好优化（DPO）方法在处理幻觉问题时依赖静态监督信号，容易过拟合，导致视觉信息的基础不牢。

Method: 提出TARS，将DPO重新定义为最小-最大优化问题，通过最大化语义约束下的分布偏移模拟对齐不确定性，同时最小化偏好损失。

Result: TARS在多个幻觉基准测试中表现优异，仅需4.8k偏好样本，将幻觉率从26.4%降至13.2%，认知值从2.5降至0.4。

Conclusion: TARS通过动态优化偏好信号，显著减少多模态推理中的幻觉，性能优于标准DPO，与GPT-4o相当。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) enable vision-language reasoning,
yet often generate plausible outputs that are factually incorrect or visually
ungrounded, thereby compromising their reliability. Direct preference
optimization (DPO) is a common strategy for correcting hallucinations by
aligning model outputs with human preferences. Existing DPO strategies
typically treat hallucination-related preferences as fixed targets, relying on
static supervision signals during training. This approach tends to overfit to
superficial linguistic cues in preference data, leading to distributional
rigidity and spurious correlations that impair grounding in causally relevant
visual information. To overcome this limitation, we propose TARS, a
token-adaptive preference strategy that reformulates DPO as a min-max
optimization problem. TARS maximizes token-level distributional shifts under
semantic constraints to simulate alignment uncertainty, and simultaneously
minimizes the expected preference loss under these controlled perturbations.
This joint objective preserves causal grounding while mitigating overfitting to
preference patterns, thereby reducing hallucinations in multimodal reasoning.
We evaluate TARS on multiple hallucination benchmarks and find consistently
strong performance. Using only 4.8k preference samples and no expert feedback,
TARS reduces hallucination rates from 26.4% to 13.2% and decreases cognition
value from 2.5 to 0.4. It outperforms standard DPO and matches GPT-4o on
several key metrics.

Result: 综述了最新技术，识别了当前挑战和现有方法的局限性。

Conclusion: 提出了未来研究方向，旨在推动WSSS领域的进一步发展。

Abstract: Unlike fully supervised semantic segmentation, weakly supervised semantic
segmentation (WSSS) relies on weaker forms of supervision to perform dense
prediction tasks. Among the various types of weak supervision, WSSS with image
level annotations is considered both the most challenging and the most
practical, attracting significant research attention. Therefore, in this
review, we focus on WSSS with image level annotations. Additionally, this
review concentrates on mainstream research directions, deliberately omitting
less influential branches.
  Given the rapid development of new methods and the limitations of existing
surveys in capturing recent trends, there is a pressing need for an updated and
comprehensive review. Our goal is to fill this gap by synthesizing the latest
advancements and state-of-the-art techniques in WSSS with image level labels.
  Basically, we provide a comprehensive review of recent advancements in WSSS
with image level labels, categorizing existing methods based on the types and
levels of additional supervision involved. We also examine the challenges of
applying advanced methods to domain specific datasets in WSSS,a topic that
remains underexplored. Finally, we discuss the current challenges, evaluate the
limitations of existing approaches, and outline several promising directions
for future research. This review is intended for researchers who are already
familiar with the fundamental concepts of WSSS and are seeking to deepen their
understanding of current advances and methodological innovations.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在身份保持、高保真图像生成和可控老化进程三个方面表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了更真实、个性化的面部老化效果，为细粒度控制提供了新思路。

Abstract: We present a novel approach to face aging that addresses the limitations of
current methods which treat aging as a global, homogeneous process. Existing
techniques using GANs and diffusion models often condition generation on a
reference image and target age, neglecting that facial regions age
heterogeneously due to both intrinsic chronological factors and extrinsic
elements like sun exposure. Our method leverages latent diffusion models to
selectively age specific facial regions using local aging signs. This approach
provides significantly finer-grained control over the generation process,
enabling more realistic and personalized aging. We employ a latent diffusion
refiner to seamlessly blend these locally aged regions, ensuring a globally
consistent and natural-looking synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate that
our method effectively achieves three key criteria for successful face aging:
robust identity preservation, high-fidelity and realistic imagery, and a
natural, controllable aging progression.

Result: 在九个基准数据集上表现优异，AUC分数分别提升25.3%、20.4%和14.8%。

Conclusion: SSTrack通过自监督学习有效减少对标注的依赖，性能显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: The success of visual tracking has been largely driven by datasets with
manual box annotations. However, these box annotations require tremendous human
effort, limiting the scale and diversity of existing tracking datasets. In this
work, we present a novel Self-Supervised Tracking framework named
\textbf{{\tracker}}, designed to eliminate the need of box annotations.
Specifically, a decoupled spatio-temporal consistency training framework is
proposed to learn rich target information across timestamps through global
spatial localization and local temporal association. This allows for the
simulation of appearance and motion variations of instances in real-world
scenarios. Furthermore, an instance contrastive loss is designed to learn
instance-level correspondences from a multi-view perspective, offering robust
instance supervision without additional labels. This new design paradigm
enables {\tracker} to effectively learn generic tracking representations in a
self-supervised manner, while reducing reliance on extensive box annotations.
Extensive experiments on nine benchmark datasets demonstrate that {\tracker}
surpasses \textit{SOTA} self-supervised tracking methods, achieving an
improvement of more than 25.3\%, 20.4\%, and 14.8\% in AUC (AO) score on the
GOT10K, LaSOT, TrackingNet datasets, respectively. Code:

Result: DeepLabv3在低对比度边界的分割任务中表现更优，证明了简单模型的潜力。

Conclusion: 在特定生物医学应用中，简单且适应性强的模型可能比复杂模型更实用，且开源实现支持进一步研究。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation requires not only accuracy but also robustness
under challenging imaging conditions. In this study, we show that a carefully
configured DeepLabv3 model can achieve high performance in segmenting induced
pluripotent stem (iPS) cell colonies, and, under our experimental conditions,
outperforms large-scale foundation models such as SAM2 and its medical variant
MedSAM2 without structural modifications. These results suggest that, for
specialized tasks characterized by subtle, low-contrast boundaries, increased
model complexity does not necessarily translate to better performance. Our work
revisits the assumption that ever-larger and more generalized architectures are
always preferable, and provides evidence that appropriately adapted, simpler
models may offer strong accuracy and practical reliability in domain-specific
biomedical applications. We also offer an open-source implementation that
includes strategies for small datasets and domain-specific encoding, with the
aim of supporting further advances in semantic segmentation for regenerative
medicine and related fields.

Conclusion: 合成数据方法有效提升了模型的泛化能力，适用于风力涡轮机检测任务。

Abstract: For the autonomous drone-based inspection of wind turbine (WT) blades,
accurate detection of the WT and its key features is essential for safe drone
positioning and collision avoidance. Existing deep learning methods typically
rely on manually labeled real-world images, which limits both the quantity and
the diversity of training datasets in terms of weather conditions, lighting,
turbine types, and image complexity. In this paper, we propose a method to
generate synthetic training data that allows controlled variation of visual and
environmental factors, increasing the diversity and hence creating challenging
learning scenarios. Furthermore, we train a YOLOv11 feature detection network
solely on synthetic WT images with a modified loss function, to detect WTs and
their key features within an image. The resulting network is evaluated both
using synthetic images and a set of real-world WT images and shows promising
performance across both synthetic and real-world data, achieving a Pose
mAP50-95 of 0.97 on real images never seen during training.

Motivation: 工业异常检测对制造系统的安全和可靠性至关重要，但现有MLLMs在IAD中表现有限，需领域特定优化。

Method: 提出EMIT框架，包括多任务IAD数据集构建、GPT生成文本描述补充缺陷图像、软提示和热图引导对比嵌入，以及难度感知GRPO策略。

Result: 在MMAD基准测试中，EMIT显著提升MLLMs的IAD性能，平均提升7.77%。

Conclusion: EMIT通过创新优化策略有效解决了MLLMs在IAD中的局限性，为工业应用提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection (IAD) plays a crucial role in maintaining the
safety and reliability of manufacturing systems. While multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) show strong vision-language reasoning abilities, their
effectiveness in IAD remains limited without domain-specific adaptation. In
this work, we propose EMIT, a unified framework that enhances MLLMs for IAD via
difficulty-aware group relative policy optimization (GRPO). EMIT constructs a
multi-task IAD dataset and utilizes GPT-generated object text descriptions to
compensate for missing defective images. For few-shot anomaly detection, it
integrates a soft prompt and heatmap-guided contrastive embeddings derived from
patch-level comparisons. To better handle difficult data samples, i.e., cases
where the MLLM struggles to generate correct answers, we propose a
difficulty-aware GRPO that extends the original GRPO by incorporating a
response resampling strategy to ensure the inclusion of correct answers in the
sampled responses, as well as an advantage reweighting mechanism to strengthen
learning from such difficult data samples. Extensive experiments on the MMAD
benchmark demonstrate that EMIT significantly enhances the IAD performance of
MLLMs, achieving an average improvement of 7.77\% over the base model
(InternVL3-8B) across seven tasks.

Result: 实验表明，GuidPaint在定性和定量评估中均优于现有的上下文感知修复方法。

Conclusion: GuidPaint提供了一种高效且无需训练的修复方法，显著提升了修复质量，同时降低了计算成本。

Abstract: In recent years, diffusion models have been widely adopted for image
inpainting tasks due to their powerful generative capabilities, achieving
impressive results. Existing multimodal inpainting methods based on diffusion
models often require architectural modifications and retraining, resulting in
high computational cost. In contrast, context-aware diffusion inpainting
methods leverage the model's inherent priors to adjust intermediate denoising
steps, enabling high-quality inpainting without additional training and
significantly reducing computation. However, these methods lack fine-grained
control over the masked regions, often leading to semantically inconsistent or
visually implausible content. To address this issue, we propose GuidPaint, a
training-free, class-guided image inpainting framework. By incorporating
classifier guidance into the denoising process, GuidPaint enables precise
control over intermediate generations within the masked areas, ensuring both
semantic consistency and visual realism. Furthermore, it integrates stochastic
and deterministic sampling, allowing users to select preferred intermediate
results and deterministically refine them. Experimental results demonstrate
that GuidPaint achieves clear improvements over existing context-aware
inpainting methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

continuous evolution of deep model architectures has driven innovation in VAD
methodologies, significantly enhancing feature representation and scene
adaptability, thereby improving algorithm generalization and expanding
application boundaries. More importantly, the rapid development of multi-modal
large language (MLLMs) and large language models (LLMs) has introduced new
opportunities and challenges to the VAD field. Under the support of MLLMs and
LLMs, VAD has undergone significant transformations in terms of data
annotation, input modalities, model architectures, and task objectives. The

LLM-based VAD methods, offering a thorough analysis of the new VAD paradigms
empowered by LLMs, constructing a classification system, and comparing their
strengths and weaknesses. Building on this foundation, this paper focuses on
current VAD methods based on MLLMs/LLMs. Finally, based on the trajectory of
technological advancements and existing bottlenecks, this paper distills key
challenges and outlines future research directions, offering guidance for the

### [45] [Automated Detection of Antarctic Benthic Organisms in High-Resolution In Situ Imagery to Aid Biodiversity Monitoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21665)
*Cameron Trotter,Huw Griffiths,Tasnuva Ming Khan,Rowan Whittle*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对南极底栖生物监测的计算机视觉框架，解决了海洋生态图像分析中的关键挑战，并在25种形态类型上表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 南极底栖生物多样性监测对理解气候变化驱动的生态变化至关重要，但传统手动标注方法效率低下。

Method: 结合分辨率保持分块、空间数据增强、微调和后处理技术，构建了一个定制化的目标检测框架。

Result: 在检测中等和大型生物方面表现优异，但对小型和稀有类群的检测仍有挑战。

Conclusion: 该框架为未来机器辅助的底栖生物多样性监测研究提供了可扩展的基础。

Abstract: Monitoring benthic biodiversity in Antarctica is vital for understanding
ecological change in response to climate-driven pressures. This work is
typically performed using high-resolution imagery captured in situ, though
manual annotation of such data remains laborious and specialised, impeding
large-scale analysis. We present a tailored object detection framework for
identifying and classifying Antarctic benthic organisms in high-resolution
towed camera imagery, alongside the first public computer vision dataset for
benthic biodiversity monitoring in the Weddell Sea. Our approach addresses key
challenges associated with marine ecological imagery, including limited
annotated data, variable object sizes, and complex seafloor structure. The
proposed framework combines resolution-preserving patching, spatial data
augmentation, fine-tuning, and postprocessing via Slicing Aided Hyper
Inference. We benchmark multiple object detection architectures and demonstrate
strong performance in detecting medium and large organisms across 25
fine-grained morphotypes, significantly more than other works in this area.
Detection of small and rare taxa remains a challenge, reflecting limitations in
current detection architectures. Our framework provides a scalable foundation
for future machine-assisted in situ benthic biodiversity monitoring research.

### [46] [APT: Improving Diffusion Models for High Resolution Image Generation with Adaptive Path Tracing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21690)
*Sangmin Han,Jinho Jeong,Jinwoo Kim,Seon Joo Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: APT框架通过统计匹配和尺度感知调度解决了基于patch方法中的分布偏移和单调性问题，提升了高分辨率图像生成的细节和速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 固定分辨率的Latent Diffusion Models在高分辨率图像生成中存在局限，而训练方法成本高，patch方法虽流行但存在分布偏移和单调性问题。

Method: 提出APT框架，结合Statistical Matching和Scale-aware Scheduling，优化patch分布一致性和单调性。

Result: APT生成更清晰的高分辨率图像细节，同时加快采样速度，质量损失小。

Conclusion: APT为高分辨率图像生成提供了实用且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) are generally trained at fixed resolutions,
limiting their capability when scaling up to high-resolution images. While
training-based approaches address this limitation by training on
high-resolution datasets, they require large amounts of data and considerable
computational resources, making them less practical. Consequently,
training-free methods, particularly patch-based approaches, have become a
popular alternative. These methods divide an image into patches and fuse the
denoising paths of each patch, showing strong performance on high-resolution
generation. However, we observe two critical issues for patch-based approaches,
which we call ``patch-level distribution shift" and ``increased patch
monotonicity." To address these issues, we propose Adaptive Path Tracing (APT),
a framework that combines Statistical Matching to ensure patch distributions
remain consistent in upsampled latents and Scale-aware Scheduling to deal with
the patch monotonicity. As a result, APT produces clearer and more refined
details in high-resolution images. In addition, APT enables a shortcut
denoising process, resulting in faster sampling with minimal quality
degradation. Our experimental results confirm that APT produces more detailed
outputs with improved inference speed, providing a practical approach to
high-resolution image generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种分步框架，通过身份阻断和医学语义补偿实现医学图像的灵活去标识化，同时保留医学语义。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像的去标识化方法未能兼顾隐私保护与医学语义保留，且缺乏灵活性。

Method: 分两步：身份阻断（调整隐私级别）和医学语义补偿（利用预训练医学基础模型）；引入特征解耦策略去除残留身份信息。

Result: 在七个数据集和三个下游任务中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该框架在隐私保护和医学语义保留方面达到最优性能。

Abstract: Medical imaging has significantly advanced computer-aided diagnosis, yet its
re-identification (ReID) risks raise critical privacy concerns, calling for
de-identification (DeID) techniques. Unfortunately, existing DeID methods
neither particularly preserve medical semantics, nor are flexibly adjustable
towards different privacy levels. To address these issues, we propose a
divide-and-conquer framework comprising two steps: (1) Identity-Blocking, which
blocks varying proportions of identity-related regions, to achieve different
privacy levels; and (2) Medical-Semantics-Compensation, which leverages
pre-trained Medical Foundation Models (MFMs) to extract medical semantic
features to compensate the blocked regions. Moreover, recognizing that features
from MFMs may still contain residual identity information, we introduce a
Minimum Description Length principle-based feature decoupling strategy, to
effectively decouple and discard such identity components. Extensive
evaluations against existing approaches across seven datasets and three
downstream tasks, demonstrates our state-of-the-art performance.

Motivation: 水下图像因光吸收、散射、海洋生物和碎片导致视觉退化，增强图像对路径检测和自主导航等任务至关重要。

Method: 提出了一种针对水下环境的评估框架，通过度量分析评估现有方法的优缺点。

Result: 框架为增强方法提供了上下文感知的基准，并验证了视觉改进对SLAM算法性能的影响。

Conclusion: 该框架为水下图像增强技术的实际应用提供了可靠的评估标准。

Abstract: We introduce local matching stability and furthest matchable frame as
quantitative measures for evaluating the success of underwater image
enhancement. This enhancement process addresses visual degradation caused by
light absorption, scattering, marine growth, and debris. Enhanced imagery plays
a critical role in downstream tasks such as path detection and autonomous
navigation for underwater vehicles, relying on robust feature extraction and
frame matching. To assess the impact of enhancement techniques on
frame-matching performance, we propose a novel evaluation framework tailored to
underwater environments. Through metric-based analysis, we identify strengths
and limitations of existing approaches and pinpoint gaps in their assessment of
real-world applicability. By incorporating a practical matching strategy, our
framework offers a robust, context-aware benchmark for comparing enhancement
methods. Finally, we demonstrate how visual improvements affect the performance
of a complete real-world algorithm -- Simultaneous Localization and Mapping
(SLAM) -- reinforcing the framework's relevance to operational underwater
scenarios.

TL;DR: 论文通过神经科学启发的消融实验，分析了三种检测Transformer模型（DETR、DDETR、DINO）内部组件的作用，揭示了模型对消融的敏感性和冗余性，并提出了优化透明度和效率的见解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 增强复杂模型（如检测Transformer）的可解释性和透明度，填补了理解内部组件作用的研究空白。

Method: 采用神经科学中的消融实验方法，系统地消融关键组件（如查询嵌入、MHSA和MHCA层），并在COCO数据集上评估性能（gIoU和F1-score）。

Result: 发现模型对消融的敏感性不同：DETR对编码器MHSA和解码器MHCA敏感，DDETR因多尺度可变形注意力更鲁棒，DINO因知识分布机制最具韧性。同时揭示了结构冗余。

Conclusion: 研究明确了内部组件对模型性能的贡献，为优化透明度和效率提供了见解，并发布了DeepDissect库以促进未来研究。

Abstract: In recent years, Explainable AI has gained traction as an approach to
enhancing model interpretability and transparency, particularly in complex
models such as detection transformers. Despite rapid advancements, a
substantial research gap remains in understanding the distinct roles of
internal components - knowledge that is essential for improving transparency
and efficiency. Inspired by neuroscientific ablation studies, which investigate
the functions of brain regions through selective impairment, we systematically
analyze the impact of ablating key components in three state-of-the-art
detection transformer models: Detection transformer (DETR), deformable
detection transformer (DDETR), and DETR with improved denoising anchor boxes
(DINO). The ablations target query embeddings, encoder and decoder multi-head
self-attentions (MHSA) as well as decoder multi-head cross-attention (MHCA)
layers. We evaluate the effects of these ablations on the performance metrics
gIoU and F1-score, quantifying effects on both the classification and
regression sub-tasks on the COCO dataset. To facilitate reproducibility and
future research, we publicly release the DeepDissect library. Our findings
reveal model-specific resilience patterns: while DETR is particularly sensitive
to ablations in encoder MHSA and decoder MHCA, DDETR's multi-scale deformable
attention enhances robustness, and DINO exhibits the greatest resilience due to
its look-forward twice update rule, which helps distributing knowledge across
blocks. These insights also expose structural redundancies, particularly in
DDETR's and DINO's decoder MHCA layers, highlighting opportunities for model
simplification without sacrificing performance. This study advances XAI for
DETRs by clarifying the contributions of internal components to model
performance, offering insights to optimize and improve transparency and
efficiency in critical applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出SAMITE模型，基于SAM2改进，通过原型记忆库和位置提示生成器解决目标遮挡和干扰问题，提升跟踪性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉目标跟踪方法在时间依赖性和泛化性上存在不足，且难以应对遮挡和干扰。

Method: 基于SAM2构建SAMITE模型，引入原型记忆库量化跟踪结果的正确性，并生成位置提示以减少干扰。

Result: 在六个基准测试中表现优越。

Conclusion: SAMITE通过改进记忆和位置提示机制，有效提升了跟踪的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Visual Object Tracking (VOT) is widely used in applications like autonomous
driving to continuously track targets in videos. Existing methods can be
roughly categorized into template matching and autoregressive methods, where
the former usually neglects the temporal dependencies across frames and the
latter tends to get biased towards the object categories during training,
showing weak generalizability to unseen classes. To address these issues, some
methods propose to adapt the video foundation model SAM2 for VOT, where the
tracking results of each frame would be encoded as memory for conditioning the
rest of frames in an autoregressive manner. Nevertheless, existing methods fail
to overcome the challenges of object occlusions and distractions, and do not
have any measures to intercept the propagation of tracking errors. To tackle
them, we present a SAMITE model, built upon SAM2 with additional modules,
including: (1) Prototypical Memory Bank: We propose to quantify the
feature-wise and position-wise correctness of each frame's tracking results,
and select the best frames to condition subsequent frames. As the features of
occluded and distracting objects are feature-wise and position-wise inaccurate,
their scores would naturally be lower and thus can be filtered to intercept
error propagation; (2) Positional Prompt Generator: To further reduce the
impacts of distractors, we propose to generate positional mask prompts to
provide explicit positional clues for the target, leading to more accurate
tracking. Extensive experiments have been conducted on six benchmarks, showing
the superiority of SAMITE. The code is available at
https://github.com/Sam1224/SAMITE.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态学习中，视觉编码后的空间和语义损失是主要挑战，现有方法存在向量间隙和语义差异，导致信息丢失。

Method: 提出MAGE框架，引入智能对齐网络（IAN）实现维度和语义对齐，采用交叉熵和均方误差的混合训练策略。

Result: MAGE在多个评估基准（MME、MMBench、SEED）上表现优于同类工作。

Conclusion: MAGE通过创新的对齐机制和训练策略，有效提升了多模态模型的性能，扩展了输出能力边界。

Abstract: In the latest advancements in multimodal learning, effectively addressing the
spatial and semantic losses of visual data after encoding remains a critical
challenge. This is because the performance of large multimodal models is
positively correlated with the coupling between visual encoders and large
language models. Existing approaches often face issues such as vector gaps or
semantic disparities, resulting in information loss during the propagation
process. To address these issues, we propose MAGE (Multimodal Alignment and
Generation Enhancement), a novel framework that bridges the semantic spaces of
vision and text through an innovative alignment mechanism. By introducing the
Intelligent Alignment Network (IAN), MAGE achieves dimensional and semantic
alignment. To reduce the gap between synonymous heterogeneous data, we employ a
training strategy that combines cross-entropy and mean squared error,
significantly enhancing the alignment effect. Moreover, to enhance MAGE's
"Any-to-Any" capability, we developed a fine-tuning dataset for multimodal
tool-calling instructions to expand the model's output capability boundaries.
Finally, our proposed multimodal large model architecture, MAGE, achieved
significantly better performance compared to similar works across various
evaluation benchmarks, including MME, MMBench, and SEED. Complete code and
appendix are available at: https://github.com/GTCOM-NLP/MAGE.

*Shijie Wang,Jian Shi,Haojie Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AdvRF提出了一种对抗性重建反馈框架，旨在学习类别无关的差异表示，以解决现有细粒度图像检索方法对预定义类别的依赖问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有细粒度图像检索方法依赖预定义类别监督，导致检索表示中引入类别特定语义，阻碍了对未见类别的泛化能力。

Method: AdvRF通过协同检索模型的类别感知差异定位与重建模型的类别无关特征学习，将FGIR重新定义为视觉差异重建任务。

Result: AdvRF在细粒度和粗粒度数据集上均表现出色。

Conclusion: AdvRF通过对抗性重建反馈机制，成功学习到类别无关的差异表示，提升了检索模型的泛化能力。

Abstract: Existing fine-grained image retrieval (FGIR) methods predominantly rely on
supervision from predefined categories to learn discriminative representations
for retrieving fine-grained objects. However, they inadvertently introduce
category-specific semantics into the retrieval representation, creating
semantic dependencies on predefined classes that critically hinder
generalization to unseen categories. To tackle this, we propose AdvRF, a novel
adversarial reconstruction feedback framework aimed at learning
category-agnostic discrepancy representations. Specifically, AdvRF reformulates
FGIR as a visual discrepancy reconstruction task via synergizing category-aware
discrepancy localization from retrieval models with category-agnostic feature
learning from reconstruction models. The reconstruction model exposes residual
discrepancies overlooked by the retrieval model, forcing it to improve
localization accuracy, while the refined signals from the retrieval model guide
the reconstruction model to improve its reconstruction ability. Consequently,
the retrieval model localizes visual differences, while the reconstruction
model encodes these differences into category-agnostic representations. This
representation is then transferred to the retrieval model through knowledge
distillation for efficient deployment. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations
demonstrate that our AdvRF achieves impressive performance on both widely-used
fine-grained and coarse-grained datasets.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于少量样本的强化学习框架（RLVR），用于卫星图像任务，无需标注数据，仅需轻量级规则奖励。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决遥感等专业领域标注数据稀缺且昂贵的问题，提升模型的推理能力。

Method: 采用1-shot RLVR范式，结合策略梯度优化，仅需少量样本即可对齐模型输出。

Result: 实验表明，即使仅用1个样本也能显著提升性能，128样本可媲美数千标注样本的模型。

Conclusion: RLVR框架为数据稀缺领域提供了一种高效、低成本的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language and vision-language models have enabled
strong reasoning capabilities, yet they remain impractical for specialized
domains like remote sensing, where annotated data is scarce and expensive. We
present the first few-shot reinforcement learning with verifiable reward (RLVR)
framework for satellite imagery that eliminates the need for caption
supervision--relying solely on lightweight, rule-based binary or IoU-based
rewards. Adapting the "1-shot RLVR" paradigm from language models to
vision-language models, we employ policy-gradient optimization with as few as
one curated example to align model outputs for satellite reasoning tasks.
Comprehensive experiments across multiple remote sensing benchmarks--including
classification, visual question answering, and grounding--show that even a
single example yields substantial improvements over the base model. Scaling to
128 examples matches or exceeds models trained on thousands of annotated
samples. While the extreme one-shot setting can induce mild, task-specific
overfitting, our approach consistently demonstrates robust generalization and
efficiency across diverse tasks. Further, we find that prompt design and loss
weighting significantly influence training stability and final accuracy. Our
method enables cost-effective and data-efficient development of
domain-specialist vision-language reasoning models, offering a pragmatic recipe
for data-scarce fields: start from a compact VLM, curate a handful of
reward-checkable cases, and train via RLVR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 驾驶员疲劳是交通事故的主要原因，现有深度学习模型计算量大，不适合资源有限的嵌入式设备。

Result: 在基准数据集上表现优异，显著降低计算复杂性和延迟。

Conclusion: LiteFat为嵌入式设备提供了实时、高效的疲劳检测解决方案。

Abstract: Detecting driver fatigue is critical for road safety, as drowsy driving
remains a leading cause of traffic accidents. Many existing solutions rely on
computationally demanding deep learning models, which result in high latency
and are unsuitable for embedded robotic devices with limited resources (such as
intelligent vehicles/cars) where rapid detection is necessary to prevent
accidents. This paper introduces LiteFat, a lightweight spatio-temporal graph
learning model designed to detect driver fatigue efficiently while maintaining
high accuracy and low computational demands. LiteFat involves converting
streaming video data into spatio-temporal graphs (STG) using facial landmark
detection, which focuses on key motion patterns and reduces unnecessary data
processing. LiteFat uses MobileNet to extract facial features and create a
feature matrix for the STG. A lightweight spatio-temporal graph neural network
is then employed to identify signs of fatigue with minimal processing and low
latency. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that LiteFat performs
competitively while significantly decreasing computational complexity and
latency as compared to current state-of-the-art methods. This work enables the
development of real-time, resource-efficient human fatigue detection systems
that can be implemented upon embedded robotic devices.

Motivation: 标准ViT存在参数冗余和计算成本高的问题，现有方法局限于静态压缩或固定计算深度。

Method: 提出MoR-ViT框架，采用token级动态递归机制，使每个token自适应确定处理深度。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K上实现SOTA准确率，参数减少70%，推理加速2.5倍，优于DynamicViT和TinyViT。

Conclusion: 动态递归是高效ViT的有效策略，为可扩展和可部署的深度学习模型开辟新途径。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved remarkable success in image
recognition, yet standard ViT architectures are hampered by substantial
parameter redundancy and high computational cost, limiting their practical
deployment. While recent efforts on efficient ViTs primarily focus on static
model compression or token-level sparsification, they remain constrained by
fixed computational depth for all tokens. In this work, we present MoR-ViT, a
novel vision transformer framework that, for the first time, incorporates a
token-level dynamic recursion mechanism inspired by the Mixture-of-Recursions
(MoR) paradigm. This approach enables each token to adaptively determine its
processing depth, yielding a flexible and input-dependent allocation of
computational resources. Extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K and transfer
benchmarks demonstrate that MoR-ViT not only achieves state-of-the-art accuracy
with up to 70% parameter reduction and 2.5x inference acceleration, but also
outperforms leading efficient ViT baselines such as DynamicViT and TinyViT
under comparable conditions. These results establish dynamic recursion as an
effective strategy for efficient vision transformers and open new avenues for
scalable and deployable deep learning models in real-world scenarios.

Method: 提出AU-LLM框架，通过增强融合投影器（EFP）将3D-CNN提取的中高层视觉特征融合为信息密集的token，供LLM进行推理。

Result: 在CASME II和SAMM数据集上，AU-LLM通过LOSO和跨域协议测试，达到了新的最优性能。

Conclusion: AU-LLM展示了LLM在微表情分析中的巨大潜力，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: The detection of micro-expression Action Units (AUs) is a formidable
challenge in affective computing, pivotal for decoding subtle, involuntary
human emotions. While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate profound
reasoning abilities, their application to the fine-grained, low-intensity
domain of micro-expression AU detection remains unexplored. This paper pioneers
this direction by introducing \textbf{AU-LLM}, a novel framework that for the
first time uses LLM to detect AUs in micro-expression datasets with subtle
intensities and the scarcity of data. We specifically address the critical
vision-language semantic gap, the \textbf{Enhanced Fusion Projector (EFP)}. The
EFP employs a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to intelligently fuse mid-level
(local texture) and high-level (global semantics) visual features from a
specialized 3D-CNN backbone into a single, information-dense token. This
compact representation effectively empowers the LLM to perform nuanced
reasoning over subtle facial muscle movements.Through extensive evaluations on
the benchmark CASME II and SAMM datasets, including stringent
Leave-One-Subject-Out (LOSO) and cross-domain protocols, AU-LLM establishes a
new state-of-the-art, validating the significant potential and robustness of
LLM-based reasoning for micro-expression analysis. The codes are available at

Conclusion: MSGCoOp在少样本和跨域泛化任务中表现出色，且计算高效。

Abstract: Vision-language pre-trained models (VLMs) such as CLIP have demonstrated
remarkable zero-shot generalization, and prompt learning has emerged as an
efficient alternative to full fine-tuning. However, existing methods often
struggle with generalization to novel classes, a phenomenon attributed to
overfitting on seen classes and forgetting general knowledge. Furthermore,
recent approaches that improve generalization often introduce complex
architectures or heavy computational overhead. In this paper, we propose a
Multiple Semantic-Guided Context Optimization (MSGCoOp) framework to enhance
few-shot generalization while maintaining computational efficiency. Our
approach leverages an ensemble of parallel learnable context vectors to capture
diverse semantic aspects. To enrich these prompts, we introduce a semantic
guidance mechanism that aligns them with comprehensive class descriptions
automatically generated by a Large Language Model (LLM). Furthermore, a
diversity regularization loss encourages the prompts to learn complementary and
orthogonal features, preventing them from collapsing into redundant
representations. Extensive experiments on 11 benchmark datasets show that
MSGCoOp significantly improves performance on base-to-novel generalization,
achieving an average harmonic mean improvement of 1.10\% over the strong KgCoOp
baseline. Our method also demonstrates enhanced robustness in cross-domain
generalization tasks. Our code is avaliable at:

Abstract: Medical image-language pre-training aims to align medical images with
clinically relevant text to improve model performance on various downstream
tasks. However, existing models often struggle with the variability and
ambiguity inherent in medical data, limiting their ability to capture nuanced
clinical information and uncertainty. This work introduces an uncertainty-aware
medical image-text pre-training model that enhances generalization capabilities
in medical image analysis. Building on previous methods and focusing on Chest
X-Rays, our approach utilizes structured text reports generated by a large
language model (LLM) to augment image data with clinically relevant context.
These reports begin with a definition of the disease, followed by the
`appearance' section to highlight critical regions of interest, and finally
`observations' and `verdicts' that ground model predictions in clinical
semantics. By modeling both inter- and intra-modal uncertainty, our framework
captures the inherent ambiguity in medical images and text, yielding improved
representations and performance on downstream tasks. Our model demonstrates
significant advances in medical image-text pre-training, obtaining
state-of-the-art performance on multiple downstream tasks.

TL;DR: HunyuanWorld 1.0是一个结合视频和3D方法优势的框架，用于从文本或图像生成沉浸式、可探索和交互的3D场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有世界生成方法在3D一致性和渲染效率上的不足，以及训练数据和内存效率的限制。

Method: 采用语义分层的3D网格表示，利用全景图像作为360度世界代理，实现语义感知的世界分解与重建。

Result: 在生成连贯、可探索和交互的3D世界方面达到最先进性能，适用于虚拟现实、游戏开发等应用。

Conclusion: HunyuanWorld 1.0成功结合了两种方法的优势，为3D世界生成提供了高效且多样化的解决方案。

Abstract: Creating immersive and playable 3D worlds from texts or images remains a
fundamental challenge in computer vision and graphics. Existing world
generation approaches typically fall into two categories: video-based methods
that offer rich diversity but lack 3D consistency and rendering efficiency, and
3D-based methods that provide geometric consistency but struggle with limited
training data and memory-inefficient representations. To address these
limitations, we present HunyuanWorld 1.0, a novel framework that combines the
best of both worlds for generating immersive, explorable, and interactive 3D
scenes from text and image conditions. Our approach features three key
advantages: 1) 360{\deg} immersive experiences via panoramic world proxies; 2)
mesh export capabilities for seamless compatibility with existing computer
graphics pipelines; 3) disentangled object representations for augmented
interactivity. The core of our framework is a semantically layered 3D mesh
representation that leverages panoramic images as 360{\deg} world proxies for
semantic-aware world decomposition and reconstruction, enabling the generation
of diverse 3D worlds. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance in generating coherent, explorable, and
interactive 3D worlds while enabling versatile applications in virtual reality,
physical simulation, game development, and interactive content creation.

<details>

Motivation: 尽管在内容审核和对齐方面取得了进展，但大型语言模型和文本到图像系统仍容易被非专家用户通过提示攻击绕过安全机制。

Method: 通过多轮叙事升级、词汇伪装、暗示链、虚构冒充和微妙语义编辑等技术，对流行的API进行实证案例分析，提出统一的提示级越狱策略分类。

Result: 研究发现，从输入过滤到输出验证的每个审核阶段都可能被可访问的策略绕过。

Conclusion: 论文强调了开发上下文感知防御的紧迫性，以应对这些越狱策略在现实场景中的易复制性。

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in alignment and content moderation, large
language models (LLMs) and text-to-image (T2I) systems remain vulnerable to
prompt-based attacks known as jailbreaks. Unlike traditional adversarial
examples requiring expert knowledge, many of today's jailbreaks are low-effort,
high-impact crafted by everyday users with nothing more than cleverly worded
prompts. This paper presents a systems-style investigation into how non-experts
reliably circumvent safety mechanisms through techniques such as multi-turn
narrative escalation, lexical camouflage, implication chaining, fictional
impersonation, and subtle semantic edits. We propose a unified taxonomy of
prompt-level jailbreak strategies spanning both text-output and T2I models,
grounded in empirical case studies across popular APIs. Our analysis reveals
that every stage of the moderation pipeline, from input filtering to output
validation, can be bypassed with accessible strategies. We conclude by
highlighting the urgent need for context-aware defenses that reflect the ease
with which these jailbreaks can be reproduced in real-world settings.

### [61] [Cross-Architecture Distillation Made Simple with Redundancy Suppression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21844)
*Weijia Zhang,Yuehao Liu,Wu Ran,Chao Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种简单的跨架构知识蒸馏方法，通过冗余信息抑制实现知识迁移，避免了复杂模块和参数冗余。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法因引入复杂模块和架构定制设计而效率低下，限制了其适用性。

Method: 提出冗余抑制蒸馏（RSD）损失，包括跨架构不变性最大化和特征去相关目标，并设计轻量模块解耦RSD目标与学生内部表示。

Result: 在CIFAR-100和ImageNet-1k基准测试中优于OFA方法，且参数开销更小。

Conclusion: 该方法简单高效，可作为跨架构知识蒸馏的强基线。

Abstract: We describe a simple method for cross-architecture knowledge distillation,
where the knowledge transfer is cast into a redundant information suppression
formulation. Existing methods introduce sophisticated modules,
architecture-tailored designs, and excessive parameters, which impair their
efficiency and applicability. We propose to extract the architecture-agnostic
knowledge in heterogeneous representations by reducing the redundant
architecture-exclusive information. To this end, we present a simple redundancy
suppression distillation (RSD) loss, which comprises cross-architecture
invariance maximisation and feature decorrelation objectives. To prevent the
student from entirely losing its architecture-specific capabilities, we further
design a lightweight module that decouples the RSD objective from the student's
internal representations. Our method is devoid of the architecture-specific
designs and complex operations in the pioneering method of OFA. It outperforms
OFA on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1k benchmarks with only a fraction of their
parameter overhead, which highlights its potential as a simple and strong
baseline to the cross-architecture distillation community.

### [62] [Unleashing the Power of Motion and Depth: A Selective Fusion Strategy for RGB-D Video Salient Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21857)
*Jiahao He,Daerji Suolang,Keren Fu,Qijun Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种选择性跨模态融合框架（SMFNet），用于RGB-D视频显著目标检测（VSOD），通过像素级选择性融合策略（PSF）和多维选择性注意力模块（MSAM）优化运动信息和深度信息的融合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RGB-D VSOD模型在利用运动信息和深度信息时未考虑其在不同场景中的贡献差异，限制了性能提升。

Method: 提出SMFNet框架，包含PSF策略（基于实际贡献选择性融合光流和深度）和MSAM模块（多维增强特征表示）。

Result: 在RDVS和DVisal数据集上全面评估，SMFNet优于19种现有模型，并在合成深度视频数据集上验证了有效性。

Conclusion: SMFNet通过选择性融合和多维注意力机制显著提升了RGB-D VSOD的性能，为未来研究提供了新基准。

Abstract: Applying salient object detection (SOD) to RGB-D videos is an emerging task
called RGB-D VSOD and has recently gained increasing interest, due to
considerable performance gains of incorporating motion and depth and that RGB-D
videos can be easily captured now in daily life. Existing RGB-D VSOD models
have different attempts to derive motion cues, in which extracting motion
information explicitly from optical flow appears to be a more effective and
promising alternative. Despite this, there remains a key issue that how to
effectively utilize optical flow and depth to assist the RGB modality in SOD.
Previous methods always treat optical flow and depth equally with respect to
model designs, without explicitly considering their unequal contributions in
individual scenarios, limiting the potential of motion and depth. To address
this issue and unleash the power of motion and depth, we propose a novel
selective cross-modal fusion framework (SMFNet) for RGB-D VSOD, incorporating a
pixel-level selective fusion strategy (PSF) that achieves optimal fusion of
optical flow and depth based on their actual contributions. Besides, we propose
a multi-dimensional selective attention module (MSAM) to integrate the fused
features derived from PSF with the remaining RGB modality at multiple
dimensions, effectively enhancing feature representation to generate refined
features. We conduct comprehensive evaluation of SMFNet against 19
state-of-the-art models on both RDVS and DVisal datasets, making the evaluation
the most comprehensive RGB-D VSOD benchmark up to date, and it also
demonstrates the superiority of SMFNet over other models. Meanwhile, evaluation
on five video benchmark datasets incorporating synthetic depth validates the
efficacy of SMFNet as well. Our code and benchmark results are made publicly
available at https://github.com/Jia-hao999/SMFNet.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vid-TTA是一种轻量级的测试时自适应框架，通过自监督辅助任务优化视频编辑，提升时间一致性和减少提示过拟合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频编辑方法存在时间不一致性和对简单提示的过拟合问题，且学习型方法计算资源需求高、数据稀缺。

Method: 提出Vid-TTA框架，结合运动感知帧重建和提示扰动重建策略，通过元学习动态平衡损失。

Result: 实验表明Vid-TTA显著提升时间一致性，减少提示过拟合，同时保持低计算开销。

Conclusion: Vid-TTA为现有视频编辑模型提供即插即用的性能提升。

Abstract: Video editing is a critical component of content creation that transforms raw
footage into coherent works aligned with specific visual and narrative
objectives. Existing approaches face two major challenges: temporal
inconsistencies due to failure in capturing complex motion patterns, and
overfitting to simple prompts arising from limitations in UNet backbone
architectures. While learning-based methods can enhance editing quality, they
typically demand substantial computational resources and are constrained by the
scarcity of high-quality annotated data. In this paper, we present Vid-TTA, a
lightweight test-time adaptation framework that personalizes optimization for
each test video during inference through self-supervised auxiliary tasks. Our
approach incorporates a motion-aware frame reconstruction mechanism that
identifies and preserves crucial movement regions, alongside a prompt
perturbation and reconstruction strategy that strengthens model robustness to
diverse textual descriptions. These innovations are orchestrated by a
meta-learning driven dynamic loss balancing mechanism that adaptively adjusts
the optimization process based on video characteristics. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Vid-TTA significantly improves video temporal consistency and
mitigates prompt overfitting while maintaining low computational overhead,
offering a plug-and-play performance boost for existing video editing models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在利用视觉线索进行消歧时效果不佳，且单一方向假设可能导致性能下降。

Method: 提出双模型框架，分别学习头部到指尖和手腕到指尖方向，引入高斯射线热图表示和CLIP感知集成模块，并添加物体中心预测任务。

Result: 在YouRefIt数据集上，0.25 IoU阈值下性能提升了约4 mAP。

Conclusion: 双模型框架和多模态集成显著提升了指向性理解的准确性。

Abstract: We address the problem of Embodied Reference Understanding, which involves
predicting the object that a person in the scene is referring to through both
pointing gesture and language. Accurately identifying the referent requires
multimodal understanding: integrating textual instructions, visual pointing,
and scene context. However, existing methods often struggle to effectively
leverage visual clues for disambiguation. We also observe that, while the
referent is often aligned with the head-to-fingertip line, it occasionally
aligns more closely with the wrist-to-fingertip line. Therefore, relying on a
single line assumption can be overly simplistic and may lead to suboptimal
performance. To address this, we propose a dual-model framework, where one
model learns from the head-to-fingertip direction and the other from the
wrist-to-fingertip direction. We further introduce a Gaussian ray heatmap
representation of these lines and use them as input to provide a strong
supervisory signal that encourages the model to better attend to pointing cues.
To combine the strengths of both models, we present the CLIP-Aware Pointing
Ensemble module, which performs a hybrid ensemble based on CLIP features.
Additionally, we propose an object center prediction head as an auxiliary task
to further enhance referent localization. We validate our approach through
extensive experiments and analysis on the benchmark YouRefIt dataset, achieving
an improvement of approximately 4 mAP at the 0.25 IoU threshold.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 克服传统顺序文本到视觉管道的局限性，提供更一致和沉浸式的叙事体验。

Method: 结合Narrator（大型语言模型）生成文本和提示，Director管理动态场景图，Narrative Arc Controller指导故事结构，Affective Tone Mapper确保情感一致性。

Result: 在多样化叙事提示的定性评估中，Aether Weaver在叙事深度、视觉保真度和情感共鸣方面优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为快速创意原型设计和沉浸式叙事体验提供了强大平台。

Abstract: We introduce Aether Weaver, a novel, integrated framework for multimodal
narrative co-generation that overcomes limitations of sequential text-to-visual
pipelines. Our system concurrently synthesizes textual narratives, dynamic
scene graph representations, visual scenes, and affective soundscapes, driven
by a tightly integrated, co-generation mechanism. At its core, the Narrator, a
large language model, generates narrative text and multimodal prompts, while
the Director acts as a dynamic scene graph manager, and analyzes the text to
build and maintain a structured representation of the story's world, ensuring
spatio-temporal and relational consistency for visual rendering and subsequent
narrative generation. Additionally, a Narrative Arc Controller guides the
high-level story structure, influencing multimodal affective consistency,
further complemented by an Affective Tone Mapper that ensures congruent
emotional expression across all modalities. Through qualitative evaluations on
a diverse set of narrative prompts encompassing various genres, we demonstrate
that Aether Weaver significantly enhances narrative depth, visual fidelity, and
emotional resonance compared to cascaded baseline approaches. This integrated
framework provides a robust platform for rapid creative prototyping and
immersive storytelling experiences.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度伪造技术对数字媒体真实性构成威胁，现有检测器在真实场景中的有效性尚未验证。

Method: 提出一种模拟真实场景的测试方法，使用先进生成技术创建包含50万张高质量深度伪造图像的数据集。

Result: 测试显示，不到一半的检测器AUC超过60%，最低为50%，且图像处理会显著降低性能。

Conclusion: 深度伪造检测仍具挑战性，需进一步改进检测器以应对真实场景。

Abstract: Deepfakes powered by advanced machine learning models present a significant
and evolving threat to identity verification and the authenticity of digital
media. Although numerous detectors have been developed to address this problem,
their effectiveness has yet to be tested when applied to real-world data. In
this work we evaluate modern deepfake detectors, introducing a novel testing
procedure designed to mimic real-world scenarios for deepfake detection. Using
state-of-the-art deepfake generation methods, we create a comprehensive dataset
containing more than 500,000 high-quality deepfake images. Our analysis shows
that detecting deepfakes still remains a challenging task. The evaluation shows
that in fewer than half of the deepfake detectors tested achieved an AUC score
greater than 60%, with the lowest being 50%. We demonstrate that basic image
manipulations, such as JPEG compression or image enhancement, can significantly
reduce model performance. All code and data are publicly available at

Motivation: 研究AI在病理学中是否学习到种族偏见及其潜在形态特征。

Method: 使用多站点数据集和注意力机制，评估三种数据整理策略。

Result: 模型能预测种族（AUC: 0.799, 0.762），但整体性能下降（AUC: 0.663）。表皮是关键特征。

Conclusion: 需谨慎数据整理和偏见缓解，以确保AI在病理学中的公平应用。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has demonstrated success in computational
pathology (CPath) for disease detection, biomarker classification, and
prognosis prediction. However, its potential to learn unintended demographic
biases, particularly those related to social determinants of health, remains
understudied. This study investigates whether deep learning models can predict
self-reported race from digitized dermatopathology slides and identifies
potential morphological shortcuts. Using a multisite dataset with a racially
diverse population, we apply an attention-based mechanism to uncover
race-associated morphological features. After evaluating three dataset curation
strategies to control for confounding factors, the final experiment showed that
White and Black demographic groups retained high prediction performance (AUC:
0.799, 0.762), while overall performance dropped to 0.663. Attention analysis
revealed the epidermis as a key predictive feature, with significant
performance declines when these regions were removed. These findings highlight
the need for careful data curation and bias mitigation to ensure equitable AI
deployment in pathology. Code available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字化艺术作品分析需要结合视觉解读和丰富的艺术、历史知识，现有方法常依赖外部链接（如Wikidata），限制了适用范围。

Method: ArtSeek包含多模态检索模块、对比多任务分类网络和基于上下文的推理策略，使用WikiFragments数据集支持知识推理。

Result: 在多个基准测试中达到最先进水平，如风格分类F1提升8.4%，ArtPedia上的标题生成BLEU@1提升7.1。

Conclusion: ArtSeek能解析视觉主题、推断历史背景，适用于缺乏外部知识的艺术作品，并可推广至其他需要外部知识的领域。

Abstract: Analyzing digitized artworks presents unique challenges, requiring not only
visual interpretation but also a deep understanding of rich artistic,
contextual, and historical knowledge. We introduce ArtSeek, a multimodal
framework for art analysis that combines multimodal large language models with
retrieval-augmented generation. Unlike prior work, our pipeline relies only on
image input, enabling applicability to artworks without links to Wikidata or
Wikipedia-common in most digitized collections. ArtSeek integrates three key
components: an intelligent multimodal retrieval module based on late
interaction retrieval, a contrastive multitask classification network for
predicting artist, genre, style, media, and tags, and an agentic reasoning
strategy enabled through in-context examples for complex visual question
answering and artwork explanation via Qwen2.5-VL. Central to this approach is
WikiFragments, a Wikipedia-scale dataset of image-text fragments curated to
support knowledge-grounded multimodal reasoning. Our framework achieves
state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks, including a +8.4% F1
improvement in style classification over GraphCLIP and a +7.1 BLEU@1 gain in
captioning on ArtPedia. Qualitative analyses show that ArtSeek can interpret
visual motifs, infer historical context, and retrieve relevant knowledge, even
for obscure works. Though focused on visual arts, our approach generalizes to
other domains requiring external knowledge, supporting scalable multimodal AI
research. Both the dataset and the source code will be made publicly available

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 眼底图像分析存在小病灶区域和疾病间差异细微的挑战，导致模型预测准确性下降和过拟合。

Method: 提出SwinECAT模型，结合Swin Attention捕捉局部和长距离依赖，ECA Attention优化特征通道。

Result: 在EDID数据集上，SwinECAT实现了88.29%的准确率，加权F1分数0.88，宏观F1分数0.90，显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: SwinECAT在9类眼底疾病分类中表现最佳，为公共数据集上的最高性能。

Abstract: In recent years, artificial intelligence has been increasingly applied in the
field of medical imaging. Among these applications, fundus image analysis
presents special challenges, including small lesion areas in certain fundus
diseases and subtle inter-disease differences, which can lead to reduced
prediction accuracy and overfitting in the models. To address these challenges,
this paper proposes the Transformer-based model SwinECAT, which combines the
Shifted Window (Swin) Attention with the Efficient Channel Attention (ECA)
Attention. SwinECAT leverages the Swin Attention mechanism in the Swin
Transformer backbone to effectively capture local spatial structures and
long-range dependencies within fundus images. The lightweight ECA mechanism is
incorporated to guide the SwinECAT's attention toward critical feature
channels, enabling more discriminative feature representation. In contrast to
previous studies that typically classify fundus images into 4 to 6 categories,
this work expands fundus disease classification to 9 distinct types, thereby
enhancing the granularity of diagnosis. We evaluate our method on the Eye
Disease Image Dataset (EDID) containing 16,140 fundus images for 9-category
classification. Experimental results demonstrate that SwinECAT achieves 88.29\%
accuracy, with weighted F1-score of 0.88 and macro F1-score of 0.90. The
classification results of our proposed model SwinECAT significantly outperform
the baseline Swin Transformer and multiple compared baseline models. To our
knowledge, this represents the highest reported performance for 9-category
classification on this public dataset.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了MMAT-1M，一个百万规模的多模态代理调优数据集，旨在提升多模态大语言模型在思维链、反思和动态工具使用方面的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态领域缺乏大规模高质量的代理调优数据集，限制了多模态大语言模型的潜力。

Method: 通过四阶段数据引擎构建MMAT-1M数据集：1) 收集公开多模态问答对；2) 使用GPT-4o生成理性并动态整合API调用和RAG信息；3) 通过反思优化理性；4) 可选地将多轮对话压缩为单轮格式。

Result: 在MMAT-1M上微调的多模态模型性能显著提升，例如InternVL2.5-8B-RR在多个基准测试中平均提升2.7%，在Dyn-VQA上提升8.8%。

Conclusion: MMAT-1M有效提升了多模态推理和工具使用能力，数据集已公开。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), enhanced through agent tuning, have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and tool
utilization, significantly surpassing the performance of standalone models.
However, the multimodal domain still lacks a large-scale, high-quality agent
tuning dataset to unlock the full potential of multimodal large language
models. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMAT-1M, the first million-scale
multimodal agent tuning dataset designed to support CoT, reflection, and
dynamic tool usage. Our dataset is constructed through a novel four-stage data
engine: 1) We first curate publicly available multimodal datasets containing
question-answer pairs; 2) Then, leveraging GPT-4o, we generate rationales for
the original question-answer pairs and dynamically integrate API calls and
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) information through a multi-turn paradigm;
3) Furthermore, we refine the rationales through reflection to ensure logical
consistency and accuracy, creating a multi-turn dialogue dataset with both
Rationale and Reflection (RR); 4) Finally, to enhance efficiency, we optionally
compress multi-turn dialogues into a One-turn Rationale and Reflection (ORR)
format. By fine-tuning open-source multimodal models on the MMAT-1M, we observe
significant performance gains. For instance, the InternVL2.5-8B-RR model
achieves an average improvement of 2.7% across eight public benchmarks and 8.8%
on the RAG benchmark Dyn-VQA, demonstrating the dataset's effectiveness in
enhancing multimodal reasoning and tool-based capabilities. The dataset is
publicly available at https://github.com/VIS-MPU-Agent/MMAT-1M.

Motivation: 现有方法在评估艺术体育表现时，难以捕捉多模态交互和长期动态变化。

Method: 引入多模态注意力一致性机制，结合视觉和音频信息，使用局部查询编码模块和两级评分。

Result: 在RG和Fis-V数据集上表现显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: LMAC-Net有效解决了多模态对齐和长期动态建模问题。

Abstract: Long-term action quality assessment (AQA) focuses on evaluating the quality
of human activities in videos lasting up to several minutes. This task plays an
important role in the automated evaluation of artistic sports such as rhythmic
gymnastics and figure skating, where both accurate motion execution and
temporal synchronization with background music are essential for performance
assessment. However, existing methods predominantly fall into two categories:
unimodal approaches that rely solely on visual features, which are inadequate
for modeling multimodal cues like music; and multimodal approaches that
typically employ simple feature-level contrastive fusion, overlooking deep
cross-modal collaboration and temporal dynamics. As a result, they struggle to
capture complex interactions between modalities and fail to accurately track
critical performance changes throughout extended sequences. To address these
challenges, we propose the Long-term Multimodal Attention Consistency Network
(LMAC-Net). LMAC-Net introduces a multimodal attention consistency mechanism to
explicitly align multimodal features, enabling stable integration of visual and
audio information and enhancing feature representations. Specifically, we
introduce a multimodal local query encoder module to capture temporal semantics
and cross-modal relations, and use a two-level score evaluation for
interpretable results. In addition, attention-based and regression-based losses
are applied to jointly optimize multimodal alignment and score fusion.
Experiments conducted on the RG and Fis-V datasets demonstrate that LMAC-Net
significantly outperforms existing methods, validating the effectiveness of our
proposed approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 后训练量化（PTQ）在数据受限（尤其是隐私约束下）时效果不佳，而现有数据无关量化（DFQ）方法生成的合成图像与量化模型泛化性之间的关系尚未充分研究。

Method: 提出mixup-class prompt策略，通过融合多个类别标签生成多样且鲁棒的合成数据，结合梯度范数和泛化误差分析提供定量见解。

Result: 在CNN和ViT上的实验表明，该方法优于现有DFQ方法（如GenQ），并在极低位宽（如W2A4）场景下达到新SOTA精度。

Conclusion: mixup-class prompt显著提升了PTQ的性能和稳定性，为数据受限场景下的量化提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) improves efficiency but struggles with
limited calibration data, especially under privacy constraints. Data-free
quantization (DFQ) mitigates this by generating synthetic images using
generative models such as generative adversarial networks (GANs) and
text-conditioned latent diffusion models (LDMs), while applying existing PTQ
algorithms. However, the relationship between generated synthetic images and
the generalizability of the quantized model during PTQ remains underexplored.
Without investigating this relationship, synthetic images generated by previous
prompt engineering methods based on single-class prompts suffer from issues
such as polysemy, leading to performance degradation. We propose
\textbf{mixup-class prompt}, a mixup-based text prompting strategy that fuses
multiple class labels at the text prompt level to generate diverse, robust
synthetic data. This approach enhances generalization, and improves
optimization stability in PTQ. We provide quantitative insights through
gradient norm and generalization error analysis. Experiments on convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs) show that our method
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art DFQ methods like GenQ. Furthermore,
it pushes the performance boundary in extremely low-bit scenarios, achieving
new state-of-the-art accuracy in challenging 2-bit weight, 4-bit activation
(W2A4) quantization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需阴影掩码的自适应门控双分支注意力机制（AGBA）和基于扩散的频率对比融合网络（FCFN），用于阴影去除，在复杂场景中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有阴影去除方法依赖难以获取的阴影掩码，而局部对比信息等内在图像线索在复杂场景中易受干扰，难以区分真实阴影与其他视觉元素。

Method: 采用AGBA动态过滤和重加权对比先验，结合FCFN利用高频和对比线索引导生成过程。

Result: 在无掩码方法中达到最优性能，与基于掩码的方法竞争性相当。

Conclusion: AGBA和FCFN的组合有效解决了阴影去除中的复杂场景挑战，提升了无掩码方法的性能。

Abstract: Existing shadow removal methods often rely on shadow masks, which are
challenging to acquire in real-world scenarios. Exploring intrinsic image cues,
such as local contrast information, presents a potential alternative for
guiding shadow removal in the absence of explicit masks. However, the cue's
inherent ambiguity becomes a critical limitation in complex scenes, where it
can fail to distinguish true shadows from low-reflectance objects and intricate
background textures. To address this motivation, we propose the Adaptive Gated
Dual-Branch Attention (AGBA) mechanism. AGBA dynamically filters and re-weighs
the contrast prior to effectively disentangle shadow features from confounding
visual elements. Furthermore, to tackle the persistent challenge of restoring
soft shadow boundaries and fine-grained details, we introduce a diffusion-based
Frequency-Contrast Fusion Network (FCFN) that leverages high-frequency and
contrast cues to guide the generative process. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results among mask-free
approaches while maintaining competitive performance relative to mask-based
methods.

<details>

Motivation: 像素级标签稀缺，尤其在工业烟雾等领域，获取详细标注困难。现有弱监督方法因监督差距和模型偏差，存在前景覆盖不全、边界不准等问题。

Result: 新框架直接针对共现问题，无需外部监督，提高了伪掩码的准确性和覆盖范围。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了弱监督语义分割中的共现问题，提升了在工业烟雾等领域的性能。

Abstract: Scarcity of pixel-level labels is a significant challenge in practical
scenarios. In specific domains like industrial smoke, acquiring such detailed
annotations is particularly difficult and often requires expert knowledge. To
alleviate this, weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) has emerged as a
promising approach. However, due to the supervision gap and inherent bias in
models trained with only image level labels, existing WSSS methods suffer from
limitations such as incomplete foreground coverage, inaccurate object
boundaries, and spurious correlations, especially in our domain, where
emissions are always spatially coupled with chimneys.
  Previous solutions typically rely on additional priors or external knowledge
to mitigate these issues, but they often lack scalability and fail to address
the model's inherent bias toward co-occurring context. To address this, we
propose a novel WSSS framework that directly targets the co-occurrence problem
without relying on external supervision. Unlike prior methods that adopt a
single network, we employ a teacher-student framework that combines CNNs and
ViTs. We introduce a knowledge transfer loss that enforces cross-architecture
consistency by aligning internal representations. Additionally, we incorporate
post-processing techniques to address partial coverage and further improve
pseudo mask quality.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖精确姿态信息，实际应用中获取困难且易受噪声影响，限制了方法的实用性。

Method: 扩展视角域重建预训练至全景域，引入RoPE滚动机制建模全景图像的水平周期性。

Result: PanoSplatt3R在无姿态信息下，生成高质量新视图和深度估计精度均显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PanoSplatt3R展示了无需姿态信息的全景重建方法的巨大潜力，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Wide-baseline panorama reconstruction has emerged as a highly effective and
pivotal approach for not only achieving geometric reconstruction of the
surrounding 3D environment, but also generating highly realistic and immersive
novel views. Although existing methods have shown remarkable performance across
various benchmarks, they are predominantly reliant on accurate pose
information. In real-world scenarios, the acquisition of precise pose often
requires additional computational resources and is highly susceptible to noise.
These limitations hinder the broad applicability and practicality of such
methods. In this paper, we present PanoSplatt3R, an unposed wide-baseline
panorama reconstruction method. We extend and adapt the foundational
reconstruction pretrainings from the perspective domain to the panoramic
domain, thus enabling powerful generalization capabilities. To ensure a
seamless and efficient domain-transfer process, we introduce RoPE rolling that
spans rolled coordinates in rotary positional embeddings across different
attention heads, maintaining a minimal modification to RoPE's mechanism, while
modeling the horizontal periodicity of panorama images. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that PanoSplatt3R, even in the absence of pose
information, significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. This
superiority is evident in both the generation of high-quality novel views and
the accuracy of depth estimation, thereby showcasing its great potential for
practical applications. Project page: https://npucvr.github.io/PanoSplatt3R

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心血管疾病是全球主要死因，早期检测至关重要。心电图（ECG）图像在临床中广泛使用，但传统方法依赖专家解读，耗时且资源密集。

Method: 采用预处理管道减少视觉噪声，并使用两阶段微调策略：先在合成和外部数据集上微调，再在目标数据集上优化。模型基于ConvNeXt架构。

Result: 在公开验证集和私有测试集上分别达到AUROC分数0.9688和0.9677，表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了作为临床工作流程中自动化ECG解释工具的潜力。

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading global cause of death, and
early detection is essential to improve patient outcomes. Electrocardiograms
(ECGs), especially 12-lead ECGs, play a key role in the identification of CVDs.
These are routinely interpreted by human experts, a process that is
time-consuming and requires expert knowledge. Historical research in this area
has focused on automatic ECG interpretation from digital signals, with recent
deep learning approaches achieving strong results. In practice, however, most
ECG data in clinical practice are stored or shared in image form. To bridge
this gap, we propose a deep learning framework designed specifically to
classify paper-like ECG images into five main diagnostic categories. Our method
was the winning entry to the 2024 British Heart Foundation Open Data Science
Challenge. It addresses two main challenges of paper ECG classification: visual
noise (e.g., shadows or creases) and the need to detect fine-detailed waveform
patterns. We propose a pre-processing pipeline that reduces visual noise and a
two-stage fine-tuning strategy: the model is first fine-tuned on synthetic and
external ECG image datasets to learn domain-specific features, and then further
fine-tuned on the target dataset to enhance disease-specific recognition. We
adopt the ConvNeXt architecture as the backbone of our model. Our method
achieved AUROC scores of 0.9688 on the public validation set and 0.9677 on the
private test set of the British Heart Foundation Open Data Science Challenge,
highlighting its potential as a practical tool for automated ECG interpretation
in clinical workflows.

Motivation: 事件相机具有高动态范围和精细时间分辨率，但在语义分割中面临稀疏噪声和模态差异的挑战。

Method: 提出EIFNet，包括自适应事件特征细化模块（AEFRM）、模态自适应重校准模块（MARM）和多头注意力门控融合模块（MGFM）。

Result: 在DDD17-Semantic和DSEC-Semantic数据集上达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: EIFNet有效解决了事件相机在语义分割中的挑战，展示了多模态融合的潜力。

Abstract: Event-based semantic segmentation explores the potential of event cameras,
which offer high dynamic range and fine temporal resolution, to achieve robust
scene understanding in challenging environments. Despite these advantages, the
task remains difficult due to two main challenges: extracting reliable features
from sparse and noisy event streams, and effectively fusing them with dense,
semantically rich image data that differ in structure and representation. To
address these issues, we propose EIFNet, a multi-modal fusion network that
combines the strengths of both event and frame-based inputs. The network
includes an Adaptive Event Feature Refinement Module (AEFRM), which improves
event representations through multi-scale activity modeling and spatial
attention. In addition, we introduce a Modality-Adaptive Recalibration Module
(MARM) and a Multi-Head Attention Gated Fusion Module (MGFM), which align and
integrate features across modalities using attention mechanisms and gated
fusion strategies. Experiments on DDD17-Semantic and DSEC-Semantic datasets
show that EIFNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating its
effectiveness in event-based semantic segmentation.

Result: 在Micro-Action 52和iMiGUE数据集上，MMN取得了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: MMN通过显式建模细微运动线索，显著提升了微动作识别的准确性。

Abstract: Micro-Actions (MAs) are an important form of non-verbal communication in
social interactions, with potential applications in human emotional analysis.
However, existing methods in Micro-Action Recognition often overlook the
inherent subtle changes in MAs, which limits the accuracy of distinguishing MAs
with subtle changes. To address this issue, we present a novel Motion-guided
Modulation Network (MMN) that implicitly captures and modulates subtle motion
cues to enhance spatial-temporal representation learning. Specifically, we
introduce a Motion-guided Skeletal Modulation module (MSM) to inject motion
cues at the skeletal level, acting as a control signal to guide spatial
representation modeling. In parallel, we design a Motion-guided Temporal
Modulation module (MTM) to incorporate motion information at the frame level,
facilitating the modeling of holistic motion patterns in micro-actions.
Finally, we propose a motion consistency learning strategy to aggregate the
motion cues from multi-scale features for micro-action classification.
Experimental results on the Micro-Action 52 and iMiGUE datasets demonstrate
that MMN achieves state-of-the-art performance in skeleton-based micro-action
recognition, underscoring the importance of explicitly modeling subtle motion
cues. The code will be available at https://github.com/momiji-bit/MMN.

Result: ZIUM在多种机器遗忘场景中表现优异，攻击成功率高且攻击时间显著减少。

Conclusion: ZIUM为机器遗忘模型的安全风险提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) removes specific data points or concepts from deep
learning models to enhance privacy and prevent sensitive content generation.
Adversarial prompts can exploit unlearned models to generate content containing
removed concepts, posing a significant security risk. However, existing
adversarial attack methods still face challenges in generating content that
aligns with an attacker's intent while incurring high computational costs to
identify successful prompts. To address these challenges, we propose ZIUM, a
Zero-shot Intent-aware adversarial attack on Unlearned Models, which enables
the flexible customization of target attack images to reflect an attacker's
intent. Additionally, ZIUM supports zero-shot adversarial attacks without
requiring further optimization for previously attacked unlearned concepts. The
evaluation across various MU scenarios demonstrated ZIUM's effectiveness in
successfully customizing content based on user-intent prompts while achieving a
superior attack success rate compared to existing methods. Moreover, its
zero-shot adversarial attack significantly reduces the attack time for
previously attacked unlearned concepts.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的方法来标记和锁定计算机视觉模型，以保护知识产权，无需微调或重新训练，且对模型性能影响极小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 保护模型所有者的知识产权，防止未经授权的使用。

Method: 通过直接修改少量模型权重实现标记和锁定，锁定模型需在输入图像中插入特定触发补丁才能使用。

Result: 实验证明方法有效，对模型性能影响小，且具有可计算的最坏情况误报率保证。

Conclusion: 新方法为保护预训练模型提供了高效且可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce new methods of staining and locking computer vision models, to
protect their owners' intellectual property. Staining, also known as
watermarking, embeds secret behaviour into a model which can later be used to
identify it, while locking aims to make a model unusable unless a secret
trigger is inserted into input images. Unlike existing methods, our algorithms
can be used to stain and lock pre-trained models without requiring fine-tuning
or retraining, and come with provable, computable guarantees bounding their
worst-case false positive rates. The stain and lock are implemented by directly
modifying a small number of the model's weights and have minimal impact on the
(unlocked) model's performance. Locked models are unlocked by inserting a small
`trigger patch' into the corner of the input image. We present experimental
results showing the efficacy of our methods and demonstrating their practical
performance on a variety of computer vision models.

Conclusion: CEDANet展示了公民科学与弱监督领域适应的可扩展性和成本效益，适用于数据稀缺的环境监测任务。

Abstract: Industrial smoke segmentation is critical for air-quality monitoring and
environmental protection but is often hampered by the high cost and scarcity of
pixel-level annotations in real-world settings. We introduce CEDANet, a
human-in-the-loop, class-aware domain adaptation framework that uniquely
integrates weak, citizen-provided video-level labels with adversarial feature
alignment. Specifically, we refine pseudo-labels generated by a source-trained
segmentation model using citizen votes, and employ class-specific domain
discriminators to transfer rich source-domain representations to the industrial
domain. Comprehensive experiments on SMOKE5K and custom IJmond datasets
demonstrate that CEDANet achieves an F1-score of 0.414 and a smoke-class IoU of
0.261 with citizen feedback, vastly outperforming the baseline model, which
scored 0.083 and 0.043 respectively. This represents a five-fold increase in
F1-score and a six-fold increase in smoke-class IoU. Notably, CEDANet with
citizen-constrained pseudo-labels achieves performance comparable to the same
architecture trained on limited 100 fully annotated images with F1-score of
0.418 and IoU of 0.264, demonstrating its ability to reach small-sampled fully
supervised-level accuracy without target-domain annotations. Our research
validates the scalability and cost-efficiency of combining citizen science with
weakly supervised domain adaptation, offering a practical solution for complex,
data-scarce environmental monitoring applications.

Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）在视觉理解和多模态推理方面表现出色，但常出现幻觉现象，即生成的文本与视觉内容不一致。现有方法多为文本中心，视觉语义对齐的挑战限制了其效果。

Conclusion: ViHallu通过视觉中心的方法有效缓解了LVLMs的幻觉问题，并发布了相关数据集ViHallu-Instruction。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in visual understanding and multimodal reasoning. However, LVLMs
frequently exhibit hallucination phenomena, manifesting as the generated
textual responses that demonstrate inconsistencies with the provided visual
content. Existing hallucination mitigation methods are predominantly
text-centric, the challenges of visual-semantic alignment significantly limit
their effectiveness, especially when confronted with fine-grained visual
understanding scenarios. To this end, this paper presents ViHallu, a
Vision-Centric Hallucination mitigation framework that enhances visual-semantic
alignment through Visual Variation Image Generation and Visual Instruction
Construction. ViHallu introduces \textbf{\textit{visual variation images}} with
controllable visual alterations while maintaining the overall image structure.
These images, combined with carefully constructed visual instructions, enable
LVLMs to better understand fine-grained visual content through fine-tuning,
allowing models to more precisely capture the correspondence between visual
content and text, thereby enhancing visual-semantic alignment. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmarks show that ViHallu effectively enhances
models' fine-grained visual understanding while significantly reducing
hallucination tendencies. Furthermore, we release ViHallu-Instruction, a visual
instruction dataset specifically designed for hallucination mitigation and
visual-semantic alignment. Code is available at

Abstract: Recent dense audio-visual (AV) models achieve impressive retrieval and
emergent localization, but almost all evidence comes from English-centric,
caption-rich web video. It is unclear whether these objectives survive in
low-resource, code-switched, and noisy multilingual settings that typify
developing regions. We show they do**-**and that the choice of aggregation
function becomes even more critical. Using a multilingual subset of Project
Vaani spanning dozens of Indian languages and dialectal variants, we compare
three contrastive objectives: (i) a global mean-pooled loss (CLIP-style), (ii)
a dense max-mean token matcher (DenseAV-style), and (iii) a simple hybrid
(motivated by frozen-vision alignment strategies). The dense objective delivers
a +59% relative R@1 (Audio Visual) improvement over global pooling and
substantially lower mean/median ranks, while consistently producing sharp
zero-shot localization heatmaps of spoken objects-despite keeping the vision
backbone entirely frozen (no LoRA / partial fine-tuning). Our results
demonstrate that dense token routing is not a luxury of high-resource English
corpora; it is more decisive when annotations and acoustic cleanliness are
scarce. We release the codebase and trained models.

Abstract: We propose a novel segmentation-based explainable artificial intelligence
(XAI) method for neural networks working on point cloud classification. As one
building block of this method, we propose a novel point-shifting mechanism to
introduce perturbations in point cloud data. Recently, AI has seen an
exponential growth. Hence, it is important to understand the decision-making
process of AI algorithms when they are applied in critical areas. Our work
focuses on explaining AI algorithms that classify point cloud data. An
important aspect of the methods used for explaining AI algorithms is their
ability to produce explanations that are easy for humans to understand. This
allows them to analyze the AI algorithms better and make appropriate decisions
based on that analysis. Therefore, in this work, we intend to generate
meaningful explanations that can be easily interpreted by humans. The point
cloud data we consider represents 3D objects such as cars, guitars, and
laptops. We make use of point cloud segmentation models to generate
explanations for the working of classification models. The segments are used to
introduce perturbations into the input point cloud data and generate saliency
maps. The perturbations are introduced using the novel point-shifting mechanism
proposed in this work which ensures that the shifted points no longer influence
the output of the classification algorithm. In contrast to previous methods,
the segments used by our method are meaningful, i.e. humans can easily
interpret the meaning of the segments. Thus, the benefit of our method over
other methods is its ability to produce more meaningful saliency maps. We
compare our method with the use of classical clustering algorithms to generate
explanations. We also analyze the saliency maps generated for example inputs
using our method to demonstrate the usefulness of the method in generating
meaningful explanations.

Conclusion: 浅层网络通过创新的位置感知技术可以在少样本学习中实现高性能，验证了研究假设。

Abstract: Deep learning has witnessed the extensive utilization across a wide spectrum
of domains, including fine-grained few-shot learning (FGFSL) which heavily
depends on deep backbones. Nonetheless, shallower deep backbones such as
ConvNet-4, are not commonly preferred because they're prone to extract a larger
quantity of non-abstract visual attributes. In this paper, we initially
re-evaluate the relationship between network depth and the ability to fully
encode few-shot instances, and delve into whether shallow deep architecture
could effectuate comparable or superior performance to mainstream deep
backbone. Fueled by the inspiration from vanilla ConvNet-4, we introduce a
location-aware constellation network (LCN-4), equipped with a cutting-edge
location-aware feature clustering module. This module can proficiently encoder
and integrate spatial feature fusion, feature clustering, and recessive feature
location, thereby significantly minimizing the overall loss. Specifically, we
innovatively put forward a general grid position encoding compensation to
effectively address the issue of positional information missing during the
feature extraction process of specific ordinary convolutions. Additionally, we
further propose a general frequency domain location embedding technique to
offset for the location loss in clustering features. We have carried out
validation procedures on three representative fine-grained few-shot benchmarks.
Relevant experiments have established that LCN-4 notably outperforms the
ConvNet-4 based State-of-the-Arts and achieves performance that is on par with
or superior to most ResNet12-based methods, confirming the correctness of our
conjecture.

object-level semantics; and 2D-3D OVS, a 2D-3D open-vocabulary semantic module
that lifts 2D features into 3D by learning fused descriptors integrating
spatial, geometric, and semantic cues. Unlike prior methods, Ov3R incorporates
CLIP semantics directly into the reconstruction process, enabling globally

Conclusion: MetaLab在小样本图像识别中表现出高精度、鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Difficult few-shot image recognition has significant application prospects,
yet remaining the substantial technical gaps with the conventional large-scale
image recognition. In this paper, we have proposed an efficient original method
for few-shot image recognition, called CIELab-Guided Coherent Meta-Learning
(MetaLab). Structurally, our MetaLab comprises two collaborative neural
networks: LabNet, which can perform domain transformation for the CIELab color
space and extract rich grouped features, and coherent LabGNN, which can
facilitate mutual learning between lightness graph and color graph. For
sufficient certification, we have implemented extensive comparative studies on
four coarse-grained benchmarks, four fine-grained benchmarks, and four
cross-domain few-shot benchmarks. Specifically, our method can achieve high
accuracy, robust performance, and effective generalization capability with
one-shot sample per class. Overall, all experiments have demonstrated that our
MetaLab can approach 99\% $\uparrow\downarrow$ accuracy, reaching the human
recognition ceiling with little visual deviation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决离散自回归建模在图像生成中的累积误差和信息丢失问题，提升生成质量和指令遵循能力。

Method: 结合语义图像分词器、统一的自回归模型和离线扩散解码器，利用强化学习优化生成过程。

Result: X-Omni在7B语言模型上实现了图像生成任务的SOTA性能，生成高质量图像并具备强指令遵循能力。

Conclusion: 强化学习能有效提升离散自回归建模的生成质量，X-Omni框架为图像与语言生成提供了统一解决方案。

Abstract: Numerous efforts have been made to extend the ``next token prediction''
paradigm to visual contents, aiming to create a unified approach for both image
generation and understanding. Nevertheless, attempts to generate images through
autoregressive modeling with discrete tokens have been plagued by issues such
as low visual fidelity, distorted outputs, and failure to adhere to complex
instructions when rendering intricate details. These shortcomings are likely
attributed to cumulative errors during autoregressive inference or information
loss incurred during the discretization process. Probably due to this
challenge, recent research has increasingly shifted toward jointly training
image generation with diffusion objectives and language generation with
autoregressive objectives, moving away from unified modeling approaches. In
this work, we demonstrate that reinforcement learning can effectively mitigate
artifacts and largely enhance the generation quality of a discrete
autoregressive modeling method, thereby enabling seamless integration of image
and language generation. Our framework comprises a semantic image tokenizer, a
unified autoregressive model for both language and images, and an offline
diffusion decoder for image generation, termed X-Omni. X-Omni achieves
state-of-the-art performance in image generation tasks using a 7B language
model, producing images with high aesthetic quality while exhibiting strong
capabilities in following instructions and rendering long texts.

*Nisarg A. Shah,Bardia Safaei,Shameema Sikder,S. Swaroop Vedula,Vishal M. Patel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StepAL是一种针对手术视频步骤识别的主动学习框架，通过整合步骤感知特征表示和熵加权聚类策略，选择需要标注的完整视频，显著减少了标注成本并提高了识别准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统主动学习方法在手术视频步骤识别中表现不佳，因为它们通常选择单个帧或片段标注，而手术视频需要完整上下文。StepAL旨在解决这一问题。

Method: StepAL结合步骤感知特征表示（利用伪标签捕捉视频内步骤分布）和熵加权聚类策略，优先选择不确定且步骤多样的视频进行标注。

Result: 在Cataract-1k和Cataract-101数据集上的实验表明，StepAL在减少标注视频数量的同时，显著提高了步骤识别的准确性。

Conclusion: StepAL为手术视频分析提供了一种高效的主动学习方法，降低了开发计算机辅助手术系统的标注负担。

Abstract: Active learning (AL) can reduce annotation costs in surgical video analysis
while maintaining model performance. However, traditional AL methods, developed
for images or short video clips, are suboptimal for surgical step recognition
due to inter-step dependencies within long, untrimmed surgical videos. These
methods typically select individual frames or clips for labeling, which is
ineffective for surgical videos where annotators require the context of the
entire video for annotation. To address this, we propose StepAL, an active
learning framework designed for full video selection in surgical step
recognition. StepAL integrates a step-aware feature representation, which
leverages pseudo-labels to capture the distribution of predicted steps within
each video, with an entropy-weighted clustering strategy. This combination
prioritizes videos that are both uncertain and exhibit diverse step
compositions for annotation. Experiments on two cataract surgery datasets
(Cataract-1k and Cataract-101) demonstrate that StepAL consistently outperforms
existing active learning approaches, achieving higher accuracy in step
recognition with fewer labeled videos. StepAL offers an effective approach for
efficient surgical video analysis, reducing the annotation burden in developing
computer-assisted surgical systems.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于运动引导的少样本视频目标分割（FSVOS）方法，并引入MOVE数据集。现有方法多关注静态对象类别，而忽略了视频中的动态信息。通过评估6种现有方法，发现其难以解决运动引导FSVOS问题，因此提出了DMA基线方法，实验证明其性能优越。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有FSVOS方法主要关注静态对象类别，忽略了视频中的动态运动模式，限制了在需要运动理解的场景中的应用。

Method: 提出MOVE数据集，并评估6种现有方法。在此基础上，提出Decoupled Motion Appearance Network（DMA）作为基线方法。

Result: 实验表明，现有方法在运动引导FSVOS任务中表现不佳，而DMA方法在少样本运动理解中表现优越。

Conclusion: DMA方法为运动引导FSVOS提供了有效的解决方案，为未来研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: This work addresses motion-guided few-shot video object segmentation (FSVOS),
which aims to segment dynamic objects in videos based on a few annotated
examples with the same motion patterns. Existing FSVOS datasets and methods
typically focus on object categories, which are static attributes that ignore
the rich temporal dynamics in videos, limiting their application in scenarios
requiring motion understanding. To fill this gap, we introduce MOVE, a
large-scale dataset specifically designed for motion-guided FSVOS. Based on
MOVE, we comprehensively evaluate 6 state-of-the-art methods from 3 different
related tasks across 2 experimental settings. Our results reveal that current
methods struggle to address motion-guided FSVOS, prompting us to analyze the
associated challenges and propose a baseline method, Decoupled Motion
Appearance Network (DMA). Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves
superior performance in few shot motion understanding, establishing a solid
foundation for future research in this direction.

TL;DR: MetaCLIP 2提出了一种从全球网络数据中训练CLIP的方法，解决了多语言数据处理的挑战，并在多项任务中超越了现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决CLIP在多语言数据上的训练挑战，包括数据点处理和多语言性能下降问题。

Method: 通过最小化必要改动，设计了一种从全球网络数据训练CLIP的配方，实现英语和非英语数据的互惠。

Result: MetaCLIP 2在零样本ImageNet分类和多语言基准测试中表现优异，超越了现有模型。

Conclusion: MetaCLIP 2为多语言CLIP训练提供了有效方案，并在性能上实现了突破。

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) is a popular foundation model,
supporting from zero-shot classification, retrieval to encoders for multimodal
large language models (MLLMs). Although CLIP is successfully trained on
billion-scale image-text pairs from the English world, scaling CLIP's training
further to learning from the worldwide web data is still challenging: (1) no
curation method is available to handle data points from non-English world; (2)
the English performance from existing multilingual CLIP is worse than its
English-only counterpart, i.e., "curse of multilinguality" that is common in
LLMs. Here, we present MetaCLIP 2, the first recipe training CLIP from scratch
on worldwide web-scale image-text pairs. To generalize our findings, we conduct
rigorous ablations with minimal changes that are necessary to address the above
challenges and present a recipe enabling mutual benefits from English and
non-English world data. In zero-shot ImageNet classification, MetaCLIP 2
ViT-H/14 surpasses its English-only counterpart by 0.8% and mSigLIP by 0.7%,
and surprisingly sets new state-of-the-art without system-level confounding
factors (e.g., translation, bespoke architecture changes) on multilingual
benchmarks, such as CVQA with 57.4%, Babel-ImageNet with 50.2% and XM3600 with
64.3% on image-to-text retrieval.

Abstract: We study the problem of sweeping a pseudoline arrangement with $n$
$x$-monotone curves with a rope (an $x$-monotone curve that connects the points
at infinity). The rope can move by flipping over a face of the arrangement,
replacing parts of it from the lower to the upper chain of the face. Counting
as length of the rope the number of edges, what rope-length can be needed in
such a sweep? We show that all such arrangements can be swept with rope-length
at most $2n-2$, and for some arrangements rope-length at least $7(n-2)/4+1$ is
required. We also discuss some complexity issues around the problem of
computing a sweep with the shortest rope-length.

Abstract: Tactile sensing plays a fundamental role in enabling robots to navigate
dynamic and unstructured environments, particularly in applications such as
delicate object manipulation, surface exploration, and human-robot interaction.
In this paper, we introduce a passive soft robotic fingertip with integrated
tactile sensing, fabricated using a 3D-printed elastomer lattice with embedded
air channels. This sensorization approach, termed fluidic innervation,
transforms the lattice into a tactile sensor by detecting pressure changes
within sealed air channels, providing a simple yet robust solution to tactile
sensing in robotics. Unlike conventional methods that rely on complex materials
or designs, fluidic innervation offers a simple, scalable, single-material
fabrication process. We characterize the sensors' response, develop a geometric
model to estimate tip displacement, and train a neural network to accurately
predict contact location and contact force. Additionally, we integrate the
fingertip with an admittance controller to emulate spring-like behavior,
demonstrate its capability for environment exploration through tactile
feedback, and validate its durability under high impact and cyclic loading
conditions. This tactile sensing technique offers advantages in terms of
simplicity, adaptability, and durability and opens up new opportunities for
versatile robotic manipulation.

Result: 实验表明，该方法比模型驱动方法精度提高26%，比学习驱动方法提高15%。

Conclusion: 该方法为低成本陀螺仪在自主平台中的导航提供了更准确和鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: An accurate initial heading angle is essential for efficient and safe
navigation across diverse domains. Unlike magnetometers, gyroscopes can provide
accurate heading reference independent of the magnetic disturbances in a
process known as gyrocompassing. Yet, accurate and timely gyrocompassing, using
low-cost gyroscopes, remains a significant challenge in scenarios where
external navigation aids are unavailable. Such challenges are commonly
addressed in real-world applications such as autonomous vehicles, where size,
weight, and power limitations restrict sensor quality, and noisy measurements
severely degrade gyrocompassing performance. To cope with this challenge, we
propose a novel diffusion denoiser-aided gyrocompass approach. It integrates a
diffusion-based denoising framework with an enhanced learning-based heading
estimation model. The diffusion denoiser processes raw inertial sensor signals
before input to the deep learning model, resulting in accurate gyrocompassing.
Experiments using both simulated and real sensor data demonstrate that our
proposed approach improves gyrocompassing accuracy by 26% compared to
model-based gyrocompassing and by 15% compared to other learning-driven
approaches. This advancement holds particular significance for ensuring
accurate and robust navigation in autonomous platforms that incorporate
low-cost gyroscopes within their navigation systems.

Abstract: Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) is a powerful approach for
controlling highly dynamic robotic systems, as it accounts for system dynamics
and optimizes control inputs at each step. However, its high computational
complexity makes implementation on resource-constrained microcontrollers

Abstract: Terrestrial-aerial bimodal vehicles, which integrate the high mobility of
aerial robots with the long endurance of ground robots, offer significant
potential for autonomous exploration. Given the inherent energy and time
constraints in practical exploration tasks, we present a hierarchical framework
for the bimodal vehicle to utilize its flexible locomotion modalities for
exploration. Beginning with extracting environmental information to identify
informative regions, we generate a set of potential bimodal viewpoints. To
adaptively manage energy and time constraints, we introduce an extended Monte
Carlo Tree Search approach that strategically optimizes both modality selection

Conclusion: 增强穿戴者对机器人的感知和定期校准身体感知对有效训练和开发更自然的辅助技术至关重要。

Abstract: Advances in wearable robotics challenge the traditional definition of human
motor systems, as wearable robots redefine body structure, movement capability,
and perception of their own bodies. We measured gait performance and perceived
body images via Selected Coefficient of Perceived Motion, SCoMo, after each
training session. Based on human motor learning theory extended to wearer-robot
systems, we hypothesized that learning the perceived body image when walking
with a robotic leg co-evolves with the actual gait improvement and becomes more
certain and more accurate to the actual motion. Our result confirmed that motor
learning improved both physical and perceived gait pattern towards normal,
indicating that via practice the wearers incorporated the robotic leg into
their sensorimotor systems to enable wearer-robot movement coordination.
However, a persistent discrepancy between perceived and actual motion remained,
likely due to the absence of direct sensation and control of the prosthesis
from wearers. Additionally, the perceptual overestimation at the later training
sessions might limit further motor improvement. These findings suggest that
enhancing the human sense of wearable robots and frequent calibrating
perception of body image are essential for effective training with lower limb
wearable robots and for developing more embodied assistive technologies.

Result: 在1dB信噪比下，平均角度误差为4度，95%的定位精度在5度以内，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在噪声环境下实现了高精度的声源定位，为机器人交互提供了可靠支持。

Abstract: This paper presents a sound source localization strategy that relies on a
microphone array embedded in an unmanned ground vehicle and an asynchronous
close-talking microphone near the operator. A signal coarse alignment strategy
is combined with a time-domain acoustic echo cancellation algorithm to estimate
a time-frequency ideal ratio mask to isolate the target speech from
interferences and environmental noise. This allows selective sound source
localization, and provides the robot with the direction of arrival of sound
from the active operator, which enables rich interaction in noisy scenarios.
Results demonstrate an average angle error of 4 degrees and an accuracy within
5 degrees of 95\% at a signal-to-noise ratio of 1dB, which is significantly
superior to the state-of-the-art localization methods.

Conclusion: 这些发现为理解具身认知的未充分探索特征提供了潜力。

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated that the dynamics of physical systems can be
utilized for the desired information processing under the framework of physical
reservoir computing (PRC). Robots with soft bodies are examples of such
physical systems, and their nonlinear body-environment dynamics can be used to
compute and generate the motor signals necessary for the control of their own
behavior. In this simulation study, we extend this approach to control and
embed not only one but also multiple behaviors into a type of soft robot called
a tensegrity robot. The resulting system, consisting of the robot and the
environment, is a multistable dynamical system that converges to different
attractors from varying initial conditions. Furthermore, attractor analysis
reveals that there exist "untrained attractors" in the state space of the
system outside the training data. These untrained attractors reflect the
intrinsic properties and structures of the tensegrity robot and its
interactions with the environment. The impacts of these recent findings in PRC
remain unexplored in embodied AI research. We here illustrate their potential
to understand various features of embodied cognition that have not been fully
addressed to date.

Result: 实验表明，该规划器通过简单调整RTG即可实现动态权衡，并在不同RTG设置下优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 所提规划器在实际应用中可靠且实用，能灵活适应不同任务需求。

Abstract: A drone trajectory planner should be able to dynamically adjust the
safety-efficiency trade-off according to varying mission requirements in
unknown environments. Although traditional polynomial-based planners offer
computational efficiency and smooth trajectory generation, they require expert
knowledge to tune multiple parameters to adjust this trade-off. Moreover, even
with careful tuning, the resulting adjustment may fail to achieve the desired
trade-off. Similarly, although reinforcement learning-based planners are
adaptable in unknown environments, they do not explicitly address the
safety-efficiency trade-off. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a
Decision Transformer-based trajectory planner that leverages a single
parameter, Return-to-Go (RTG), as a \emph{temperature parameter} to dynamically
adjust the safety-efficiency trade-off. In our framework, since RTG intuitively
measures the safety and efficiency of a trajectory, RTG tuning does not require
expert knowledge. We validate our approach using Gazebo simulations in both
structured grid and unstructured random environments. The experimental results
demonstrate that our planner can dynamically adjust the safety-efficiency
trade-off by simply tuning the RTG parameter. Furthermore, our planner
outperforms existing baseline methods across various RTG settings, generating
safer trajectories when tuned for safety and more efficient trajectories when
tuned for efficiency. Real-world experiments further confirm the reliability
and practicality of our proposed planner.

Abstract: This work focuses on multi-floor indoor exploration, which remains an open
area of research. Compared to traditional methods, recent learning-based
explorers have demonstrated significant potential due to their robust
environmental learning and modeling capabilities, but most are restricted to 2D
environments. In this paper, we proposed a learning-integrated topological
explorer, LITE, for multi-floor indoor environments. LITE decomposes the
environment into a floor-stair topology, enabling seamless integration of
learning or non-learning-based 2D exploration methods for 3D exploration. As we
incrementally build floor-stair topology in exploration using YOLO11-based
instance segmentation model, the agent can transition between floors through a
finite state machine. Additionally, we implement an attention-based 2D
exploration policy that utilizes an attention mechanism to capture spatial
dependencies between different regions, thereby determining the next global
goal for more efficient exploration. Extensive comparison and ablation studies
conducted on the HM3D and MP3D datasets demonstrate that our proposed 2D
exploration policy significantly outperforms all baseline explorers in terms of
exploration efficiency. Furthermore, experiments in several 3D multi-floor
environments indicate that our framework is compatible with various 2D
exploration methods, facilitating effective multi-floor indoor exploration.
Finally, we validate our method in the real world with a quadruped robot,
highlighting its strong generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Human demonstration data is often ambiguous and incomplete, motivating
imitation learning approaches that also exhibit reliable planning behavior. A
common paradigm to perform planning-from-demonstration involves learning a
reward function via Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) then deploying this
reward via Model Predictive Control (MPC). Towards unifying these methods, we
derive a replacement of the policy in IRL with a planning-based agent. With
connections to Adversarial Imitation Learning, this formulation enables
end-to-end interactive learning of planners from observation-only
demonstrations. In addition to benefits in interpretability, complexity, and
safety, we study and observe significant improvements on sample efficiency,

TL;DR: UniDomain框架通过预训练PDDL领域，从机器人操作演示中提取原子领域，支持在线任务规划，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs和VLMs在长时程结构和符号基础方面的不足，以及现有方法在泛化能力上的限制。

Method: 从12,393个操作视频中提取原子领域，构建统一领域，并融合为高质量元领域以支持组合泛化。

Result: 在零样本任务中，UniDomain实现了58%更高的任务成功率和160%的计划最优性提升。

Conclusion: UniDomain在复杂任务规划中表现出色，支持组合泛化，优于现有基线。

Abstract: Robotic task planning in real-world environments requires reasoning over
implicit constraints from language and vision. While LLMs and VLMs offer strong
priors, they struggle with long-horizon structure and symbolic grounding.
Existing methods that combine LLMs with symbolic planning often rely on
handcrafted or narrow domains, limiting generalization. We propose UniDomain, a
framework that pre-trains a PDDL domain from robot manipulation demonstrations
and applies it for online robotic task planning. It extracts atomic domains
from 12,393 manipulation videos to form a unified domain with 3137 operators,
2875 predicates, and 16481 causal edges. Given a target class of tasks, it
retrieves relevant atomics from the unified domain and systematically fuses
them into high-quality meta-domains to support compositional generalization in
planning. Experiments on diverse real-world tasks show that UniDomain solves
complex, unseen tasks in a zero-shot manner, achieving up to 58% higher task
success and 160% improvement in plan optimality over state-of-the-art LLM and
LLM-PDDL baselines.

limitations. The environment taken as reference in this work is the highly
challenging case of underground tunnels. We also highlight potential new
research areas still under-explored.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of autonomous driving technology,
vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication has emerged as a key enabler for
extending perception range and enhancing driving safety by providing visibility
beyond the line of sight. However, integrating multi-source sensor data from
both ego-vehicles and infrastructure under real-world constraints, such as
limited communication bandwidth and dynamic environments, presents significant
technical challenges. To facilitate research in this area, we organized the
End-to-End Autonomous Driving through V2X Cooperation Challenge, which features
two tracks: cooperative temporal perception and cooperative end-to-end
planning. Built on the UniV2X framework and the V2X-Seq-SPD dataset, the
challenge attracted participation from over 30 teams worldwide and established
a unified benchmark for evaluating cooperative driving systems. This paper
describes the design and outcomes of the challenge, highlights key research
problems including bandwidth-aware fusion, robust multi-agent planning, and
heterogeneous sensor integration, and analyzes emerging technical trends among
top-performing solutions. By addressing practical constraints in communication
and data fusion, the challenge contributes to the development of scalable and
reliable V2X-cooperative autonomous driving systems.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于场景-对象的可靠性评估框架和姿态优化策略，显著提升了动态环境下的SLAM定位精度和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SLAM方法在动态环境中因假设静态环境而存在定位漂移问题，现有系统在视角突变和移动物体处理上仍有不足。

Method: 结合当前帧质量指标和场景变化评估SLAM稳定性，并利用可靠帧信息优化相机姿态估计。

Result: 在TUM RGB-D数据集上的实验表明，该方法在动态场景下显著提高了定位精度和系统鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 提出的框架和策略有效解决了动态环境中的SLAM定位问题，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) plays a vital role in
real-time localization for autonomous systems. However, traditional SLAM
methods, which assume a static environment, often suffer from significant
localization drift in dynamic scenarios. While recent advancements have
improved SLAM performance in such environments, these systems still struggle
with localization drift, particularly due to abrupt viewpoint changes and
poorly characterized moving objects. In this paper, we propose a novel
scene-object-based reliability assessment framework that comprehensively
evaluates SLAM stability through both current frame quality metrics and scene
changes relative to reliable reference frames. Furthermore, to tackle the lack
of error correction mechanisms in existing systems when pose estimation becomes
unreliable, we employ a pose refinement strategy that leverages information
from reliable frames to optimize camera pose estimation, effectively mitigating
the adverse effects of dynamic interference. Extensive experiments on the TUM
RGB-D datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves substantial improvements
in localization accuracy and system robustness under challenging dynamic
scenarios.

Motivation: 在障碍密集环境中，无人机的通信受限，需通过多跳网络解决通信问题，但网络设计和动态连接维护是两大挑战。

Method: 提出基于最小边RRT算法的约束搜索方法设计网络拓扑，并采用分布式模型预测控制策略协调运动，确保距离和视线连接约束。

Result: 理论保证无人机轨迹无碰撞且始终保持团队视线连接，仿真和硬件实验验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法高效解决了多无人机在障碍环境中的通信网络部署和动态连接问题。

Abstract: A reliable communication network is essential for multiple UAVs operating
within obstacle-cluttered environments, where limited communication due to
obstructions often occurs. A common solution is to deploy intermediate UAVs to
relay information via a multi-hop network, which introduces two challenges: (i)
how to design the structure of multihop networks; and (ii) how to maintain
connectivity during collaborative motion. To this end, this work first proposes
an efficient constrained search method based on the minimumedge RRT? algorithm,
to find a spanning-tree topology that requires a less number of UAVs for the
deployment task. Then, to achieve this deployment, a distributed model
predictive control strategy is proposed for the online motion coordination. It
explicitly incorporates not only the inter-UAV and UAVobstacle distance
constraints, but also the line-of-sight (LOS) connectivity constraint. These
constraints are well-known to be nonlinear and often tackled by various
approximations. In contrast, this work provides a theoretical guarantee that
all agent trajectories are ensured to be collision-free with a teamwise LOS
connectivity at all time. Numerous simulations are performed in 3D valley-like
environments, while hardware experiments validate its dynamic adaptation when
the deployment position changes online.

Abstract: Mobile manipulation is a critical capability for robots operating in diverse,
real-world environments. However, manipulating deformable objects and materials
remains a major challenge for existing robot learning algorithms. While various
benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate manipulation strategies with rigid
objects, there is still a notable lack of standardized benchmarks that address
mobile manipulation tasks involving deformable objects.
  To address this gap, we introduce MoDeSuite, the first Mobile Manipulation
Deformable Object task suite, designed specifically for robot learning.
MoDeSuite consists of eight distinct mobile manipulation tasks covering both
elastic objects and deformable objects, each presenting a unique challenge
inspired by real-world robot applications. Success in these tasks requires
effective collaboration between the robot's base and manipulator, as well as
the ability to exploit the deformability of the objects. To evaluate and
demonstrate the use of the proposed benchmark, we train two state-of-the-art
reinforcement learning algorithms and two imitation learning algorithms,
highlighting the difficulties encountered and showing their performance in
simulation. Furthermore, we demonstrate the practical relevance of the suite by
deploying the trained policies directly into the real world with the Spot
robot, showcasing the potential for sim-to-real transfer. We expect that
MoDeSuite will open a novel research domain in mobile manipulation involving
deformable objects. Find more details, code, and videos at

Conclusion: ExamPPO为自动驾驶决策系统的安全性和智能性评估提供了统一且可复现的解决方案。

Abstract: Scientific testing techniques are essential for ensuring the safe operation
of autonomous vehicles (AVs), with high-risk, highly interactive scenarios
being a primary focus. To address the limitations of existing testing methods,
such as their heavy reliance on high-quality test data, weak interaction
capabilities, and low adversarial robustness, this paper proposes ExamPPO, an
interactive adversarial testing framework that enables scenario-adaptive and
intensity-controllable evaluation of autonomous vehicles. The framework models
the Surrounding Vehicle (SV) as an intelligent examiner, equipped with a
multi-head attention-enhanced policy network, enabling context-sensitive and
sustained behavioral interventions. A scalar confrontation factor is introduced
to modulate the intensity of adversarial behaviors, allowing continuous,
fine-grained adjustment of test difficulty. Coupled with structured evaluation
metrics, ExamPPO systematically probes AV's robustness across diverse scenarios
and strategies. Extensive experiments across multiple scenarios and AV
strategies demonstrate that ExamPPO can effectively modulate adversarial
behavior, expose decision-making weaknesses in tested AVs, and generalize
across heterogeneous environments, thereby offering a unified and reproducible
solution for evaluating the safety and intelligence of autonomous
decision-making systems.

Abstract: Testing and evaluating automated driving systems (ADS) in interactions with
vulnerable road users (VRUs), such as cyclists, are essential for improving the
safety of VRUs, but often lack realism. This paper presents and validates a
coupled in-the-loop test environment that integrates a Cyclist-in-the Loop test
bench with a Vehicle-in-the-Loop test bench via a virtual environment (VE)
developed in Unreal Engine 5. The setup enables closed-loop, bidirectional
interaction between a real human cyclist and a real automated vehicle under
safe and controllable conditions. The automated vehicle reacts to cyclist
gestures via stimulated camera input, while the cyclist, riding a stationary
bicycle, perceives and reacts to the vehicle in the VE in real time. Validation
experiments are conducted using a real automated shuttle bus with a
track-and-follow function, performing three test maneuvers - straight-line
driving with stop, circular track driving, and double lane change - on a
proving ground and in the coupled in-the-loop test environment. The performance
is evaluated by comparing the resulting vehicle trajectories in both
environments. Additionally, the introduced latencies of individual components
in the test setup are measured. The results demonstrate the feasibility of the
approach and highlight its strengths and limitations for realistic ADS
evaluation.

Abstract: One major recurring challenge in deploying manipulation robots is determining
the optimal placement of manipulators to maximize performance. This challenge
is exacerbated in complex, cluttered agricultural environments of high-value
crops, such as flowers, fruits, and vegetables, that could greatly benefit from
robotic systems tailored to their specific requirements. However, the design of
such systems remains a challenging, intuition-driven process, limiting the
affordability and adoption of robotics-based automation by domain experts like
farmers. To address this challenge, we propose a four-part design optimization
methodology for automating the development of task-specific robotic systems.
This framework includes (a) a robot design model, (b) task and environment
representations for simulation, (c) task-specific performance metrics, and (d)
optimization algorithms for refining configurations. We demonstrate our
framework by optimizing a dual-arm robotic system for pepper harvesting using
two off-the-shelf redundant manipulators. To enhance performance, we introduce
novel task metrics that leverage self-motion manifolds to characterize
manipulator redundancy comprehensively. Our results show that our framework
achieves simultaneous improvements in reachability success rates and
improvements in dexterity. Specifically, our approach improves reachability
success by at least 14\% over baseline methods and achieves over 30\%
improvement in dexterity based on our task-specific metric.

Conclusion: 本文方法为冗余机械臂提供了全局IK解，解决了传统方法的局限性，并在多种场景中验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Redundant manipulators are well understood to offer infinite joint
configurations for achieving a desired end-effector pose. The multiplicity of
inverse kinematics (IK) solutions allows for the simultaneous solving of
auxiliary tasks like avoiding joint limits or obstacles. However, the most
widely used IK solvers are numerical gradient-based iterative methods that
inherently return a locally optimal solution. In this work, we explore the
computation of self-motion manifolds (SMMs), which represent the set of all
joint configurations that solve the inverse kinematics problem for redundant
manipulators. Thus, SMMs are global IK solutions for redundant manipulators. We
focus on task redundancies of dimensionality 1, introducing a novel ODE
formulation for computing SMMs using standard explicit fixed-step ODE
integrators. We also address the challenge of ``inducing'' redundancy in
otherwise non-redundant manipulators assigned to tasks naturally described by
one degree of freedom less than the non-redundant manipulator. Furthermore,
recognizing that SMMs can consist of multiple disconnected components, we
propose methods for searching for these separate SMM components. Our
formulations and algorithms compute accurate SMM solutions without requiring
additional IK refinement, and we extend our methods to prismatic joint systems
-- an area not covered in current SMM literature. This manuscript presents the
derivation of these methods and several examples that show how the methods work
and their limitations.

Abstract: Retinal vein cannulation (RVC) is a minimally invasive microsurgical
procedure for treating retinal vein occlusion (RVO), a leading cause of vision
impairment. However, the small size and fragility of retinal veins, coupled
with the need for high-precision, tremor-free needle manipulation, create
significant technical challenges. These limitations highlight the need for
robotic assistance to improve accuracy and stability. This study presents an
automated robotic system with a top-down microscope and B-scan optical
coherence tomography (OCT) imaging for precise depth sensing. Deep
learning-based models enable real-time needle navigation, contact detection,
and vein puncture recognition, using a chicken embryo model as a surrogate for
human retinal veins. The system autonomously detects needle position and
puncture events with 85% accuracy. The experiments demonstrate notable
reductions in navigation and puncture times compared to manual methods. Our
results demonstrate the potential of integrating advanced imaging and deep
learning to automate microsurgical tasks, providing a pathway for safer and
more reliable RVC procedures with enhanced precision and reproducibility.

Abstract: Model predictive control (MPC) combined with reduced-order template models
has emerged as a powerful tool for trajectory optimization in dynamic legged
locomotion. However, loco-manipulation tasks performed by legged robots
introduce additional complexity, necessitating computationally efficient MPC
algorithms capable of handling high-degree-of-freedom (DoF) models. This letter
presents a computationally efficient nonlinear MPC (NMPC) framework tailored
for loco-manipulation tasks of quadrupedal robots equipped with robotic
manipulators whose dynamics are non-negligible relative to those of the
quadruped. The proposed framework adopts a decomposition strategy that couples
locomotion template models -- such as the single rigid body (SRB) model -- with
a full-order dynamic model of the robotic manipulator for torque-level control.
This decomposition enables efficient real-time solution of the NMPC problem in
a receding horizon fashion at 60 Hz. The optimal state and input trajectories
generated by the NMPC for locomotion are tracked by a low-level nonlinear
whole-body controller (WBC) running at 500 Hz, while the optimal torque
commands for the manipulator are directly applied. The layered control
architecture is validated through extensive numerical simulations and hardware
experiments on a 15-kg Unitree Go2 quadrupedal robot augmented with a 4.4-kg
4-DoF Kinova arm. Given that the Kinova arm dynamics are non-negligible
relative to the Go2 base, the proposed NMPC framework demonstrates robust
stability in performing diverse loco-manipulation tasks, effectively handling
external disturbances, payload variations, and uneven terrain.

Conclusion: Mass-Spring Net是一种高效且准确的布料模拟方法，优于基于图和神经ODE的架构。

Abstract: Materials used in real clothing exhibit remarkable complexity and spatial
variation due to common processes such as stitching, hemming, dyeing, printing,
padding, and bonding. Simulating these materials, for instance using finite
element methods, is often computationally demanding and slow. Worse, such
methods can suffer from numerical artifacts called ``membrane locking'' that
makes cloth appear artificially stiff. Here we propose a general framework,
called Mass-Spring Net, for learning a simple yet efficient surrogate model
that captures the effects of these complex materials using only motion
observations. The cloth is discretized into a mass-spring network with unknown
material parameters that are learned directly from the motion data, using a
novel force-and-impulse loss function. Our approach demonstrates the ability to
accurately model spatially varying material properties from a variety of data
sources, and immunity to membrane locking which plagues FEM-based simulations.
Compared to graph-based networks and neural ODE-based architectures, our method
achieves significantly faster training times, higher reconstruction accuracy,
and improved generalization to novel dynamic scenarios.

Abstract: 3D creation has always been a unique human strength, driven by our ability to
deconstruct and reassemble objects using our eyes, mind and hand. However,
current 3D design tools struggle to replicate this natural process, requiring
considerable artistic expertise and manual labor. This paper introduces BANG, a
novel generative approach that bridges 3D generation and reasoning, allowing
for intuitive and flexible part-level decomposition of 3D objects. At the heart
of BANG is "Generative Exploded Dynamics", which creates a smooth sequence of
exploded states for an input geometry, progressively separating parts while
preserving their geometric and semantic coherence.
  BANG utilizes a pre-trained large-scale latent diffusion model, fine-tuned
for exploded dynamics with a lightweight exploded view adapter, allowing
precise control over the decomposition process. It also incorporates a temporal
attention module to ensure smooth transitions and consistency across time. BANG
enhances control with spatial prompts, such as bounding boxes and surface
regions, enabling users to specify which parts to decompose and how. This
interaction can be extended with multimodal models like GPT-4, enabling
2D-to-3D manipulations for more intuitive and creative workflows.
  The capabilities of BANG extend to generating detailed part-level geometry,
associating parts with functional descriptions, and facilitating
component-aware 3D creation and manufacturing workflows. Additionally, BANG
offers applications in 3D printing, where separable parts are generated for
easy printing and reassembly. In essence, BANG enables seamless transformation
from imaginative concepts to detailed 3D assets, offering a new perspective on
creation that resonates with human intuition.
