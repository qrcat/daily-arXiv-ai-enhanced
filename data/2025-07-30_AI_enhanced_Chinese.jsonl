At the heart\nof BANG is \"Generative Exploded Dynamics\", which creates a smooth sequence of\nexploded states for an input geometry, progressively separating parts while\npreserving their geometric and semantic coherence.\n  BANG utilizes a pre-trained large-scale latent diffusion model, fine-tuned\nfor exploded dynamics with a lightweight exploded view adapter, allowing\nprecise control over the decomposition process. It also incorporates a temporal\nattention module to ensure smooth transitions and consistency across time. BANG\nenhances control with spatial prompts, such as bounding boxes and surface\nregions, enabling users to specify which parts to decompose and how.

While enabling users to edit charts based on\nhigh-level intentions is of great practical value, existing methods primarily\nrely on natural language instructions, which are often too ambiguous to support\nfine-grained editing. In this work, we introduce a novel paradigm for\nmultimodal chart editing, where user intent is expressed through a combination\nof natural language and visual indicators that explicitly highlight the\nelements to be modified. To support this paradigm, we present\nChart$\\text{M}^3$, a new benchmark for Multimodal chart editing with\nMulti-level complexity and Multi-perspective evaluation. Chart$\\text{M}^3$\ncontains 1,000 samples spanning four levels of editing difficulty. Each sample\nincludes triplets in the form of (chart, code, multimodal instructions).

Similarly, although reinforcement learning-based planners are\nadaptable in unknown environments, they do not explicitly address the\nsafety-efficiency trade-off.

In our framework, since RTG intuitively\nmeasures the safety and efficiency of a trajectory, RTG tuning does not require\nexpert knowledge. We validate our approach using Gazebo simulations in both\nstructured grid and unstructured random environments. The experimental results\ndemonstrate that our planner can dynamically adjust the safety-efficiency\ntrade-off by simply tuning the RTG parameter.

However, existing methods often construct BEV\nrepresentations by collapsing extracted object features, neglecting intrinsic\nenvironmental contexts, such as roads and pavements. This hinders detectors\nfrom comprehensively perceiving the characteristics of the physical world. To\nalleviate this, we introduce a multi-task learning framework, Collaborative\nPerceiver (CoP), that leverages spatial occupancy as auxiliary information to\nmine consistent structural and conceptual similarities shared between 3D object\ndetection and occupancy prediction tasks, bridging gaps in spatial\nrepresentations and feature refinement. To this end, we first propose a\npipeline to generate dense occupancy ground truths incorporating local density\ninformation (LDO) for reconstructing detailed environmental information. Next,\nwe employ a voxel-height-guided sampling (VHS) strategy to distill fine-grained\nlocal features according to distinct object properties. Furthermore, we develop\na global-local collaborative feature fusion (CFF) module that seamlessly\nintegrates complementary knowledge between both tasks, thus composing more\nrobust BEV representations.

The framework comprises three modules: the\nLatent Prior Extractor (LPE) predicts the LDP by supervising domain shifts; the\nDomain Compensation Module (DCM) adjusts feature representations to mitigate\ndomain shifts; and the Diffusion Prior Estimator (DPE) leverages a diffusion\nprocess to estimate the LDP without requiring paired samples.

The multiplicity of\ninverse kinematics (IK) solutions allows for the simultaneous solving of\nauxiliary tasks like avoiding joint limits or obstacles.

In this work, we explore the\ncomputation of self-motion manifolds (SMMs), which represent the set of all\njoint configurations that solve the inverse kinematics problem for redundant\nmanipulators. Thus, SMMs are global IK solutions for redundant manipulators. We\nfocus on task redundancies of dimensionality 1, introducing a novel ODE\nformulation for computing SMMs using standard explicit fixed-step ODE\nintegrators. We also address the challenge of ``inducing'' redundancy in\notherwise non-redundant manipulators assigned to tasks naturally described by\none degree of freedom less than the non-redundant manipulator. Furthermore,\nrecognizing that SMMs can consist of multiple disconnected components, we\npropose methods for searching for these separate SMM components. Our\nformulations and algorithms compute accurate SMM solutions without requiring\nadditional IK refinement, and we extend our methods to prismatic joint systems\n-- an area not covered in current SMM literature.

Learned Bird's-Eye View (BEV) encoders are commonly used to fuse\nmultiple inputs, and a vector decoder predicts a vectorized map representation\nfrom the latent BEV grid. However, traditional map construction models provide\ndeterministic point estimates, failing to capture uncertainty and the inherent\nambiguities of real-world environments, such as occlusions and missing lane\nmarkings. We propose MapDiffusion, a novel generative approach that leverages\nthe diffusion paradigm to learn the full distribution of possible vectorized\nmaps. Instead of predicting a single deterministic output from learned queries,\nMapDiffusion iteratively refines randomly initialized queries, conditioned on a\nBEV latent grid, to generate multiple plausible map samples. This allows\naggregating samples to improve prediction accuracy and deriving uncertainty\nestimates that directly correlate with scene ambiguity. Extensive experiments\non the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that MapDiffusion achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance in online map construction, surpassing the baseline by 5% in\nsingle-sample performance.

In\ngeneral, current approaches, which rely on intra-image pixel-wise consistency\ntraining via pseudo-labeling, overlook the consistency at more comprehensive\nsemantic levels (e.g., object region) and suffer from severe discrepancy of\nextracted features resulting from an imbalanced number of labeled and unlabeled\ndata. To overcome these limitations, we present a new \\underline{Du}al\n\\underline{C}ross-\\underline{i}mage \\underline{S}emantic\n\\underline{C}onsistency (DuCiSC) learning framework, for semi-supervised\nmedical image segmentation. Concretely, beyond enforcing pixel-wise semantic\nconsistency, DuCiSC proposes dual paradigms to encourage region-level semantic\nconsistency across: 1) labeled and unlabeled images; and 2) labeled and fused\nimages, by explicitly aligning their prototypes. Relying on the dual paradigms,\nDuCiSC can effectively establish consistent cross-image semantics via prototype\nrepresentations, thereby addressing the feature discrepancy issue. Moreover, we\ndevise a novel self-aware confidence estimation strategy to accurately select\nreliable pseudo labels, allowing for exploiting the training dynamics of\nunlabeled data. Our DuCiSC method is extensively validated on four datasets,\nincluding two popular binary benchmarks in segmenting the left atrium and\npancreas, a multi-class Automatic Cardiac Diagnosis Challenge dataset, and a\nchallenging scenario of segmenting the inferior alveolar nerve that features\ncomplicated anatomical structures, showing superior segmentation results over\nprevious state-of-the-art approaches.

Existing methods\ntypically utilize all modalities (i.e., voxels, point clouds, multi-view\nimages) and train specific backbones before fusion. However, they still\nstruggle to produce generalized representations due to insufficient 3D training\ndata. Being contrastively pre-trained on web-scale image-text pairs, CLIP\ninherently produces generalized representations for a wide range of downstream\ntasks. Building upon it, we present a simple yet effective framework named\nDescribe, Adapt and Combine (DAC) by taking only multi-view images for open-set\n3DOR. DAC innovatively synergizes a CLIP model with a multi-modal large\nlanguage model (MLLM) to learn generalized 3D representations, where the MLLM\nis used for dual purposes. First, it describes the seen category information to\nalign with CLIP's training objective for adaptation during training. Second, it\nprovides external hints about unknown objects complementary to visual cues\nduring inference. To improve the synergy, we introduce an Additive-Bias\nLow-Rank adaptation (AB-LoRA), which alleviates overfitting and further\nenhances the generalization to unseen categories.

A promising\nstrategy is to augment the training data with online synthesized fake images\ncontaining broadly generalizable artifacts.

The Sun and fixed stars are the\ntwo primary astronomical sensing objects. Attitude sensors are critical\ncomponents for the survival and knowledge improvement of spacecraft. Of these,\nsun sensors are the most common and important sensor for spacecraft attitude\ndetermination. The sun sensor measures the Sun vector in spacecraft\ncoordinates. The sun sensor calibration process is particularly difficult due\nto the complex nature of the uncertainties involved. The uncertainties are\nsmall, difficult to observe, and vary spatio-temporally over the lifecycle of\nthe sensor. In addition, the sensors are affected by numerous sources of\nuncertainties, including manufacturing, electrical, environmental, and\ninterference sources. This motivates the development of advanced calibration\nalgorithms to minimize uncertainty over the sensor lifecycle and improve\naccuracy.

Our experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet with VGG and ResNet\nbackbones demonstrate that LinDeps improves compression rates of existing\npruning techniques while preserving performances, leading to a new state of the\nart in CNN pruning.

Existing RGB-D VSOD models\nhave different attempts to derive motion cues, in which extracting motion\ninformation explicitly from optical flow appears to be a more effective and\npromising alternative. Despite this, there remains a key issue that how to\neffectively utilize optical flow and depth to assist the RGB modality in SOD.\nPrevious methods always treat optical flow and depth equally with respect to\nmodel designs, without explicitly considering their unequal contributions in\nindividual scenarios, limiting the potential of motion and depth.

We conduct comprehensive evaluation of SMFNet against 19\nstate-of-the-art models on both RDVS and DVisal datasets, making the evaluation\nthe most comprehensive RGB-D VSOD benchmark up to date, and it also\ndemonstrates the superiority of SMFNet over other models.

However, existing methods often struggle to effectively\nleverage visual clues for disambiguation.

Therefore, relying on a\nsingle line assumption can be overly simplistic and may lead to suboptimal\nperformance. To address this, we propose a dual-model framework, where one\nmodel learns from the head-to-fingertip direction and the other from the\nwrist-to-fingertip direction.

Among these applications, fundus image analysis\npresents special challenges, including small lesion areas in certain fundus\ndiseases and subtle inter-disease differences, which can lead to reduced\nprediction accuracy and overfitting in the models. To address these challenges,\nthis paper proposes the Transformer-based model SwinECAT, which combines the\nShifted Window (Swin) Attention with the Efficient Channel Attention (ECA)\nAttention. SwinECAT leverages the Swin Attention mechanism in the Swin\nTransformer backbone to effectively capture local spatial structures and\nlong-range dependencies within fundus images. The lightweight ECA mechanism is\nincorporated to guide the SwinECAT's attention toward critical feature\nchannels, enabling more discriminative feature representation. In contrast to\nprevious studies that typically classify fundus images into 4 to 6 categories,\nthis work expands fundus disease classification to 9 distinct types, thereby\nenhancing the granularity of diagnosis. We evaluate our method on the Eye\nDisease Image Dataset (EDID) containing 16,140 fundus images for 9-category\nclassification.

However, due to the supervision gap and inherent bias in\nmodels trained with only image level labels, existing WSSS methods suffer from\nlimitations such as incomplete foreground coverage, inaccurate object\nboundaries, and spurious correlations, especially in our domain, where\nemissions are always spatially coupled with chimneys.\n  Previous solutions typically rely on additional priors or external knowledge\nto mitigate these issues, but they often lack scalability and fail to address\nthe model's inherent bias toward co-occurring context. To address this, we\npropose a novel WSSS framework that directly targets the co-occurrence problem\nwithout relying on external supervision. Unlike prior methods that adopt a\nsingle network, we employ a teacher-student framework that combines CNNs and\nViTs. We introduce a knowledge transfer loss that enforces cross-architecture\nconsistency by aligning internal representations. Additionally, we incorporate\npost-processing techniques to address partial coverage and further improve\npseudo mask quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408CNN\u548cViT\u7684\u5e08\u751f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u70df\u96fe\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u56e0\u5171\u73b0\u95ee\u9898\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u6807\u7b7e\u7a00\u7f3a\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u70df\u96fe\u7b49\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u83b7\u53d6\u8be6\u7ec6\u6807\u6ce8\u56f0\u96be\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u76d1\u7763\u5dee\u8ddd\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u524d\u666f\u8986\u76d6\u4e0d\u5168\u3001\u8fb9\u754c\u4e0d\u51c6\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5e08\u751f\u6846\u67b6\u7ed3\u5408CNN\u548cViT\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u77e5\u8bc6\u8f6c\u79fb\u635f\u5931\u4ee5\u5bf9\u9f50\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u52a0\u5165\u540e\u5904\u7406\u6280\u672f\u63d0\u5347\u4f2a\u63a9\u7801\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\u76f4\u63a5\u9488\u5bf9\u5171\u73b0\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5916\u90e8\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u4f2a\u63a9\u7801\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u8986\u76d6\u8303\u56f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u7684\u5171\u73b0\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u70df\u96fe\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

In real-world scenarios, the acquisition of precise pose often\nrequires additional computational resources and is highly susceptible to noise.\nThese limitations hinder the broad applicability and practicality of such\nmethods. In this paper, we present PanoSplatt3R, an unposed wide-baseline\npanorama reconstruction method.

Nevertheless, attempts to generate images through\nautoregressive modeling with discrete tokens have been plagued by issues such\nas low visual fidelity, distorted outputs, and failure to adhere to complex\ninstructions when rendering intricate details. These shortcomings are likely\nattributed to cumulative errors during autoregressive inference or information\nloss incurred during the discretization process. Probably due to this\nchallenge, recent research has increasingly shifted toward jointly training\nimage generation with diffusion objectives and language generation with\nautoregressive objectives, moving away from unified modeling approaches. In\nthis work, we demonstrate that reinforcement learning can effectively mitigate\nartifacts and largely enhance the generation quality of a discrete\nautoregressive modeling method, thereby enabling seamless integration of image\nand language generation.

In zero-shot ImageNet classification, MetaCLIP 2\nViT-H/14 surpasses its English-only counterpart by 0.8% and mSigLIP by 0.7%,\nand surprisingly sets new state-of-the-art without system-level confounding\nfactors (e.g., translation, bespoke architecture changes) on multilingual\nbenchmarks, such as CVQA with 57.4%, Babel-ImageNet with 50.2% and XM3600 with\n64.3% on image-to-text retrieval.", "AI": {"tldr": "MetaCLIP 2\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4ece\u5168\u7403\u7f51\u7edc\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u8bad\u7ec3CLIP\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u9879\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3CLIP\u5728\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6570\u636e\u70b9\u5904\u7406\u548c\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5fc5\u8981\u6539\u52a8\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4ece\u5168\u7403\u7f51\u7edc\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3CLIP\u7684\u914d\u65b9\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u82f1\u8bed\u548c\u975e\u82f1\u8bed\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4e92\u60e0\u3002", "result": "MetaCLIP 2\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672cImageNet\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "MetaCLIP 2\u4e3a\u591a\u8bed\u8a00CLIP\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7a81\u7834\u3002"}}
