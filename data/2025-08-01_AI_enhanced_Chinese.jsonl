Although the topology of the graph is fixed,\nwe have control over the edge-weight assignment $w:E\\to \\mathbb{R}_{\\ge 0}$,\nand hope to have grid distances be asymptotically isometric to Euclidean\ndistances, that is, for all grid points $u,v$, $\\mathrm{dist}_w(u,v) = (1\\pm\no(1))\\|u-v\\|_2$. We give three methods for solving this problem, each\nattractive in its own way.\n  * Our first construction is based on an embedding of the recursive,\nnon-periodic pinwheel tiling of Radin and Conway into the integer grid.\nDistances in the pinwheel graph are asymptotically isometric to Euclidean\ndistances, but no explicit bound on the rate of convergence was known. We prove\nthat the multiplicative distortion of the pinwheel graph is\n$(1+1/\\Theta(\\log^\\xi \\log D))$, where $D$ is the Euclidean distance and\n$\\xi=\\Theta(1)$. The pinwheel tiling approach is conceptually simple, but can\nbe improved quantitatively.\n  * Our second construction is based on a hierarchical arrangement of\n\"highways.\" It is simple, achieving stretch $(1 + 1/\\Theta(D^{1/9}))$, which\nconverges doubly exponentially faster than the pinwheel tiling approach.\n  * The first two methods are deterministic. An even simpler approach is to\nsample the edge weights independently from a common distribution $\\mathscr{D}$.\nWhether there exists a distribution $\\mathscr{D}^*$ that makes grid distances\nEuclidean, asymptotically and in expectation, is major open problem in the\ntheory of first passage percolation. Previous experiments show that when\n$\\mathscr{D}$ is a Fisher distribution, grid distances are within 1\\% of\nEuclidean. We demonstrate experimentally that this level of accuracy can be\nachieved by a simple 2-point distribution that assigns weights 0.41 or 4.75\nwith probability 44\\% and 56\\%, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u65e0\u9650\u6574\u6570\u7f51\u683c\u56fe\u4e0a\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u975e\u5468\u671f\u6027\u98ce\u8f66\u5e73\u94fa\u7684\u6784\u9020\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u9ad8\u901f\u516c\u8def\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u6784\u9020\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u968f\u673a\u8fb9\u6743\u91cd\u5206\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u76ee\u6807\u662f\u4f7f\u7f51\u683c\u8ddd\u79bb\u6e10\u8fd1\u7b49\u8ddd\u4e8e\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u8ddd\u79bb\uff0c\u5373\u7f51\u683c\u70b9\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\u4e0e\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u6bd4\u503c\u8d8b\u8fd1\u4e8e1\u3002", "method": "1. \u57fa\u4e8e\u98ce\u8f66\u5e73\u94fa\u7684\u6784\u9020\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u5931\u771f\u7387\u4e3a(1+1/\u0398(log^\u03be log D))\uff1b2. \u57fa\u4e8e\u9ad8\u901f\u516c\u8def\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u6784\u9020\uff0c\u5931\u771f\u7387\u4e3a(1 + 1/\u0398(D^{1/9}))\uff1b3. \u968f\u673a\u8fb9\u6743\u91cd\u5206\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7b80\u5355\u4e24\u70b9\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u98ce\u8f66\u5e73\u94fa\u65b9\u6cd5\u5931\u771f\u7387\u8f83\u4f4e\u4f46\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u6162\uff1b\u9ad8\u901f\u516c\u8def\u65b9\u6cd5\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u66f4\u5feb\uff1b\u968f\u673a\u5206\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5355\u4e24\u70b9\u5206\u5e03\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e861%\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e09\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5404\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u98ce\u8f66\u5e73\u94fa\u6982\u5ff5\u7b80\u5355\uff0c\u9ad8\u901f\u516c\u8def\u65b9\u6cd5\u6536\u655b\u5feb\uff0c\u968f\u673a\u65b9\u6cd5\u7b80\u5355\u4e14\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6548\u679c\u826f\u597d\u3002"}}

At the root of this trend is a fundamental advantage held by those\nmanipulating media: equal access to a distribution of what we consider\nauthentic (i.e., \"natural\") video. In this paper, we show how coding very\nsubtle, noise-like modulations into the illumination of a scene can help combat\nthis advantage by creating an information asymmetry that favors verification.\nOur approach effectively adds a temporal watermark to any video recorded under\ncoded illumination. However, rather than encoding a specific message, this\nwatermark encodes an image of the unmanipulated scene as it would appear lit\nonly by the coded illumination. We show that even when an adversary knows that\nour technique is being used, creating a plausible coded fake video amounts to\nsolving a second, more difficult version of the original adversarial content\ncreation problem at an information disadvantage.

Synthetic\ndata methods are gaining prominence due to the cost and complexity of gathering\nreal-world data, but they demand a high degree of realism and controllability\nto be useful. This work introduces two novel methods for synthetic data\ngeneration in autonomous driving and medical image analysis, namely MObI and\nAnydoorMed, respectively. MObI is a first-of-its-kind framework for Multimodal\nObject Inpainting that leverages a diffusion model to produce realistic and\ncontrollable object inpaintings across perceptual modalities, demonstrated\nsimultaneously for camera and lidar. Given a single reference RGB image, MObI\nenables seamless object insertion into existing multimodal scenes at a\nspecified 3D location, guided by a bounding box, while maintaining semantic\nconsistency and multimodal coherence. Unlike traditional inpainting methods\nthat rely solely on edit masks, this approach uses 3D bounding box conditioning\nto ensure accurate spatial positioning and realistic scaling. AnydoorMed\nextends this paradigm to the medical imaging domain, focusing on\nreference-guided inpainting for mammography scans. It leverages a\ndiffusion-based model to inpaint anomalies with impressive detail preservation,\nmaintaining the reference anomaly's structural integrity while semantically\nblending it with the surrounding tissue.

Recent research has\ndemonstrated that combining large language models (LLMs) with vision-language\nmodels (VLMs) makes open-set recognition possible without the need for\npredefined class labels. However, the existing methods are often limited in\nharnessing the power of LLMs at the classification phase, and also rely heavily\non the guessed class names provided by an LLM without thorough analysis and\nrefinement.

Current AV planning systems typically\nrely on rigid rules, which struggle to balance these competing considerations\nand can lead to behaviour that misaligns with human expectations. This paper\nproposes a novel reasons-based trajectory evaluation framework that\noperationalises the tracking condition of Meaningful Human Control (MHC). The\nframework models the reasons of human agents, such as regulatory compliance, as\nquantifiable functions and evaluates how well candidate AV trajectories align\nwith these reasons.

We further enhance expressiveness and disentangle motion\nlatents from identity cues by supervising their learning with a dual GAN\ndecoder, alongside spatial and color augmentations. By embedding the driving\nmotion into a 1D latent vector and controlling motion via cross-attention\nrather than additive spatial guidance, our design eliminates the transmission\nof spatial-aligned structural clues from the driving condition to the diffusion\nbackbone, substantially mitigating identity leakage. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that X-NeMo surpasses state-of-the-art baselines, producing highly\nexpressive animations with superior identity resemblance.

To address the above challenges, we propose an adversarial-guided\ndiffusion (AGD) approach for adversarial attack MLLMs. We introduce\nadversarial-guided noise to ensure attack efficacy. A key observation in our\ndesign is that, unlike most traditional adversarial attacks which embed\nhigh-frequency perturbations directly into the clean image, AGD injects target\nsemantics into the noise component of the reverse diffusion. Since the added\nnoise in a diffusion model spans the entire frequency spectrum, the adversarial\nsignal embedded within it also inherits this full-spectrum property.\nImportantly, during reverse diffusion, the adversarial image is formed as a\nlinear combination of the clean image and the noise.

CITRAS is compact (73.7x15.6x2.1\nmm), lightweight (491 mg), and low-power (32 mW), enabling seamless integration\nwith miniature robotic platforms. The segmented compliant structure passively\nbends in response to environmental stimuli, achieving accurate hinge angle\nmeasurements with maximum errors of just 0.79 degree (quasistatic bending) and\n3.58 degree (dynamic bending). Experimental evaluations demonstrate CITRAS'\nmultifunctional tactile perception capabilities: predicting base-to-tip\ndistances with 7.75 % error, estimating environmental gap widths with 6.73 %\nerror, and distinguishing surface textures through differential sensor\nresponse. The future integration of this bioinspired tactile antenna in\ninsect-scale robots addresses critical sensing gaps, promising enhanced\nautonomous exploration, obstacle avoidance, and environmental mapping in\ncomplex, confined environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aCITRAS\u7684\u4eff\u751f\u89e6\u89c9\u4f20\u611f\u5668\uff0c\u7075\u611f\u6765\u81ea\u7f8e\u6d32\u87d1\u8782\u7684\u89e6\u89d2\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5fae\u578b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u56e0\u5c3a\u5bf8\u3001\u91cd\u91cf\u548c\u529f\u7387\u9650\u5236\u800c\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u89e6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u7f8e\u6d32\u87d1\u8782\u901a\u8fc7\u89e6\u89d2\u83b7\u53d6\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u89e6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6280\u672f\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u5fae\u578b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u7c7b\u4f3c\u529f\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u6bb5\u67d4\u6027\u5c42\u538b\u4f20\u611f\u5668\uff08CITRAS\uff09\uff0c\u5185\u7f6e\u7535\u5bb9\u89d2\u5ea6\u4f20\u611f\u5668\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u8f7b\u91cf\u5316\u3001\u4f4e\u529f\u8017\u7684\u7279\u70b9\u3002", "result": "CITRAS\u5728\u9759\u6001\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u5f2f\u66f2\u65f6\u7684\u89d2\u5ea6\u6d4b\u91cf\u8bef\u5dee\u5206\u522b\u4ec5\u4e3a0.79\u5ea6\u548c3.58\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u8ddd\u79bb\u3001\u4f30\u7b97\u95f4\u9699\u5bbd\u5ea6\u548c\u533a\u5206\u8868\u9762\u7eb9\u7406\u3002", "conclusion": "CITRAS\u4e3a\u5fae\u578b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u591a\u529f\u80fd\u89e6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u63a2\u7d22\u548c\u907f\u969c\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

However, mapping a comprehensive and detailed\nCN atlas is challenging because of the unique anatomical structures of each CN\npair and the complexity of the skull base environment.In this work, we present\nwhat we believe to be the first study to develop a comprehensive diffusion\ntractography atlas for automated mapping of CN pathways in the human brain. The\nCN atlas is generated by fiber clustering by using the streamlines generated by\nmulti-parametric fiber tractography for each pair of CNs. Instead of disposable\nclustering, we explore a new strategy of multi-stage fiber clustering for\nmultiple analysis of approximately 1,000,000 streamlines generated from the 50\nsubjects from the Human Connectome Project (HCP). Quantitative and visual\nexperiments demonstrate that our CN atlas achieves high spatial correspondence\nwith expert manual annotations on multiple acquisition sites, including the HCP\ndataset, the Multi-shell Diffusion MRI (MDM) dataset and two clinical cases of\npituitary adenoma patients. The proposed CN atlas can automatically identify 8\nfiber bundles associated with 5 pairs of CNs, including the optic nerve CN II,\noculomotor nerve CN III, trigeminal nerve CN V and facial-vestibulocochlear\nnerve CN VII/VIII, and its robustness is demonstrated experimentally.

While traditional\nnumerical metrics like mean squared error (MSE) can quantify point-wise\naccuracy, they fail to evaluate the geometric structure of time series data,\nwhich is essential to understand temporal dynamics. To address this issue, we\npropose the time series Geometric Structure Index (TGSI), a novel evaluation\nmetric that transforms time series into images to leverage their inherent\ntwo-dimensional geometric representations. However, since the image\ntransformation process is non-differentiable, TGSI cannot be directly\nintegrated as a training loss. We further introduce the Shape-Aware Temporal\nLoss (SATL), a multi-component loss function operating in the time series\nmodality to bridge this gap and enhance structure modeling during training.\nSATL combines three components: a first-order difference loss that measures\nstructural consistency through the MSE between first-order differences, a\nfrequency domain loss that captures essential periodic patterns using the Fast\nFourier Transform while minimizing noise, and a perceptual feature loss that\nmeasures geometric structure difference in time-series by aligning temporal\nfeatures with geometric structure features through a pre-trained temporal\nfeature extractor and time-series image autoencoder. Experiments across\nmultiple datasets demonstrate that models trained with SATL achieve superior\nperformance in both MSE and the proposed TGSI metrics compared to baseline\nmethods, without additional computational cost during inference.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807TGSI\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570SATL\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u6355\u6349\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eSATL\u5728MSE\u548cTGSI\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6570\u503c\u6307\u6807\uff08\u5982MSE\uff09\u65e0\u6cd5\u8bc4\u4f30\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u800c\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u7406\u89e3\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTGSI\u6307\u6807\u5c06\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u56fe\u50cf\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1SATL\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff08\u5305\u542b\u4e00\u9636\u5dee\u5206\u635f\u5931\u3001\u9891\u57df\u635f\u5931\u548c\u611f\u77e5\u7279\u5f81\u635f\u5931\uff09\u4ee5\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u589e\u5f3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528SATL\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728MSE\u548cTGSI\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u65e0\u989d\u5916\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "SATL\u548cTGSI\u4e3a\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002"}}

To address this limitation, we build a large-scale\ngrasping-oriented affordance segmentation benchmark with human-like\ninstructions, named RAGNet. It contains 273k images, 180 categories, and 26k\nreasoning instructions. The images cover diverse embodied data domains, such as\nwild, robot, ego-centric, and even simulation data. They are carefully\nannotated with an affordance map, while the difficulty of language instructions\nis largely increased by removing their category name and only providing\nfunctional descriptions.

To this end, we propose a novel\nretrieval framework, Bidirectional Likelihood Estimation with MLLM (BLiM),\nwhich leverages both query and candidate likelihoods by training the model to\ngenerate text from a given video as well as video features from a given text.\nFurthermore, we introduce Candidate Prior Normalization (CPN), a simple yet\neffective training-free score calibration module designed to mitigate candidate\nprior bias in candidate likelihood. On four Text-Video Retrieval benchmarks,\nour BLiM equipped with CPN outperforms previous state-of-the-art models by 6.4\nR@1 on average, effectively alleviating candidate prior bias and emphasizing\nquery-candidate relevance. Our in-depth analysis across various multi-modal\ntasks beyond retrieval highlights the broad applicability of CPN which enhances\nvisual understanding by reducing reliance on textual priors.

However, the long\nvisual tokens of VLA models greatly increase computational costs. Current\nvisual token pruning methods in Vision-Language Models (VLM) rely on either\nvisual token similarity or visual-text attention, but both have shown poor\nperformance in autonomous driving scenarios. Given that human drivers\nconcentrate on relevant foreground areas while driving, we assert that\nretaining visual tokens containing this foreground information is essential for\neffective decision-making. Inspired by this, we propose FastDriveVLA, a novel\nreconstruction-based vision token pruning framework designed specifically for\nautonomous driving. FastDriveVLA includes a plug-and-play visual token pruner\ncalled ReconPruner, which prioritizes foreground information through MAE-style\npixel reconstruction.

To address this, we propose a hierarchical emotional understanding\nchain with learnable expert queries that progressively extracts multi-scale\nemotional features, thereby serving as a foundational step for unification.\nSimultaneously, we fuse these expert queries and emotional representations to\nguide the diffusion model in generating emotion-evoking images. To enhance the\ndiversity and fidelity of the generated emotional images, we further introduce\nthe emotional correlation coefficient and emotional condition loss into the\nfusion process. This step facilitates fusion and alignment for emotional\ngeneration guided by the understanding. In turn, we demonstrate that joint\ntraining allows the generation component to provide implicit feedback to the\nunderstanding part.

Most 3D\ndata simulation methods inject predefined physical priors but struggle to\ncapture the full complexity of real data. An optimal approach involves learning\nan implicit mapping from synthetic to realistic data in a data-driven manner,\nbut progress in this solution has met stagnation in recent studies. This work\nexplores a new solution path of data-driven 3D simulation, called\nStable-Sim2Real, based on a novel two-stage depth diffusion model. The initial\nstage finetunes Stable-Diffusion to generate the residual between the real and\nsynthetic paired depth, producing a stable but coarse depth, where some local\nregions may deviate from realistic patterns. To enhance this, both the\nsynthetic and initial output depth are fed into a second-stage diffusion, where\ndiffusion loss is adjusted to prioritize these distinct areas identified by a\n3D discriminator. We provide a new benchmark scheme to evaluate 3D data\nsimulation methods. Extensive experiments show that training the network with\nthe 3D simulated data derived from our method significantly enhances\nperformance in real-world 3D visual tasks.

Traditional\nmanual calibration methods are often time-consuming, labor-intensive, and may\nrequire road closures. This paper proposes MamV2XCalib, the first V2X-based\ninfrastructure camera calibration method with the assistance of vehicle-side\nLiDAR. MamV2XCalib only requires autonomous vehicles equipped with LiDAR to\ndrive near the cameras to be calibrated in the infrastructure, without the need\nfor specific reference objects or manual intervention. We also introduce a new\ntargetless LiDAR-camera calibration method, which combines multi-scale features\nand a 4D correlation volume to estimate the correlation between vehicle-side\npoint clouds and roadside images. We model the temporal information and\nestimate the rotation angles with Mamba, effectively addressing calibration\nfailures in V2X scenarios caused by defects in the vehicle-side data (such as\nocclusions) and large differences in viewpoint.

Recent studies\ndemonstrate that frequency features can not only enhance feature representation\nto compensate for appearance limitations but also perceive motion through\ndynamic variations in frequency energy.

Moreover, the gradient-based densification strategy designed for\nstatic scene reconstruction proves inadequate to address the absence of dynamic\ncontent. In light of these challenges, we propose a flow-empowered velocity\nfield modeling scheme tailored for Gaussian video reconstruction, dubbed\nFlowGaussian-VR. It consists of two core components: a velocity field rendering\n(VFR) pipeline which enables optical flow-based optimization, and a\nflow-assisted adaptive densification (FAD) strategy that adjusts the number and\nsize of Gaussians in dynamic regions. We validate our model's effectiveness on\nmulti-view dynamic reconstruction and novel view synthesis with multiple\nreal-world datasets containing challenging motion scenarios, demonstrating not\nonly notable visual improvements (over 2.5 dB gain in PSNR) and less blurry\nartifacts in dynamic textures, but also regularized and trackable per-Gaussian\ntrajectories.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aFlowGaussian-VR\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u901f\u5ea6\u573a\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u6d41\u8f85\u52a9\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u8fd0\u52a8\u548c\u5c3a\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u4e0b3D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f3D\u89c6\u9891\u91cd\u5efa\u5bf9VR/AR\u4e2d\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u6e32\u67d3\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u590d\u6742\u8fd0\u52a8\u548c\u5c3a\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "FlowGaussian-VR\u5305\u542b\u901f\u5ea6\u573a\u6e32\u67d3\uff08VFR\uff09\u7ba1\u9053\u548c\u6d41\u8f85\u52a9\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff08FAD\uff09\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u52a8\u6001\u5185\u5bb9\u91cd\u5efa\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff08PSNR\u589e\u76ca\u8d85\u8fc72.5 dB\uff09\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u7eb9\u7406\u6a21\u7cca\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u9ad8\u65af\u8f68\u8ff9\u66f4\u89c4\u5219\u53ef\u8ffd\u8e2a\u3002", "conclusion": "FlowGaussian-VR\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u8fd0\u52a8\u573a\u666f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Methods that use this approach combine\nthe power and flexibility of the functional map framework, with data-driven\nlearning for improved accuracy and generality. However, most existing methods\nin this area restrict the learning aspect only to the feature functions and\nstill rely on axiomatic modeling for formulating the training loss or for\nfunctional map regularization inside the networks. This limits both the\naccuracy and the applicability of the resulting approaches only to scenarios\nwhere assumptions of the axiomatic models hold. In this work, we show, for the\nfirst time, that both in-network regularization and functional map training can\nbe replaced with data-driven methods. For this, we first train a generative\nmodel of functional maps in the spectral domain using score-based generative\nmodeling, built from a large collection of high-quality maps. We then exploit\nthe resulting model to promote the structural properties of ground truth\nfunctional maps on new shape collections. Remarkably, we demonstrate that the\nlearned models are category-agnostic, and can fully replace commonly used\nstrategies such as enforcing Laplacian commutativity or orthogonality of\nfunctional maps. Our key technical contribution is a novel distillation\nstrategy from diffusion models in the spectral domain. Experiments demonstrate\nthat our learned regularization leads to better results than axiomatic\napproaches for zero-shot non-rigid shape matching.

To bridge this gap, we introduce the novel task of Sequential 3D\nGaussian Affordance Reasoning and establish SeqAffordSplat, a large-scale\nbenchmark featuring 1800+ scenes to support research on long-horizon affordance\nunderstanding in complex 3DGS environments. We then propose SeqSplatNet, an\nend-to-end framework that directly maps an instruction to a sequence of 3D\naffordance masks.

It also exhibits remarkable\ngeneralization to in-the-wild video inputs despite being trained exclusively on\nsynthetic data, paving the way for generating high-quality animated 3D content.\nProject page: https://gvfdiffusion.github.io/.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4ece\u5355\u89c6\u9891\u8f93\u5165\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u52a8\u60013D\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76f4\u63a5\u7f16\u7801\u9ad8\u65af\u6e85\u5c04\uff08GS\uff09\u53ca\u5176\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e864D\u6269\u6563\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u76f4\u63a54D\u6269\u6563\u5efa\u6a21\u56e0\u6570\u636e\u6784\u5efa\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u548c3D\u5f62\u72b6\u3001\u5916\u89c2\u53ca\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u9ad8\u7ef4\u8054\u5408\u8868\u793a\u800c\u6781\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165Direct 4DMesh-to-GS Variation Field VAE\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u7f16\u7801\u9ad8\u65af\u6e85\u5c04\u53ca\u5176\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u9010\u5b9e\u4f8b\u62df\u5408\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u9ad8\u65af\u53d8\u5316\u573a\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728Objaverse\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u771f\u5b9e\u89c6\u9891\u8f93\u5165\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u52a8\u60013D\u5185\u5bb9\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}
