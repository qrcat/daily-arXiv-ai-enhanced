### [1] [A Quality-Guided Mixture of Score-Fusion Experts Framework for Human Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00053)
*Jie Zhu,Yiyang Su,Minchul Kim,Anil Jain,Xiaoming Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为QME的新框架，通过可学习的分数融合策略提升全身生物识别性能，解决了传统方法中分数分布差异和数据质量变化的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统全身生物识别方法通过分数融合处理多模态数据，但忽略了各模态分数分布的差异，限制了性能提升。

Method: QME框架结合了Mixture of Experts (MoE)和两种新损失函数（伪质量损失和分数三元组损失），通过质量估计器和可学习分数融合策略优化性能。

Result: 在多个数据集上实现了最先进的性能，解决了模型在相似性分数域中的不对齐和数据质量变化等关键挑战。

Conclusion: QME框架在多模态和多模型场景下表现优异，为全身生物识别提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Whole-body biometric recognition is a challenging multimodal task that
integrates various biometric modalities, including face, gait, and body. This
integration is essential for overcoming the limitations of unimodal systems.
Traditionally, whole-body recognition involves deploying different models to
process multiple modalities, achieving the final outcome by score-fusion (e.g.,
weighted averaging of similarity matrices from each model). However, these
conventional methods may overlook the variations in score distributions of
individual modalities, making it challenging to improve final performance. In
this work, we present \textbf{Q}uality-guided \textbf{M}ixture of score-fusion
\textbf{E}xperts (QME), a novel framework designed for improving whole-body
biometric recognition performance through a learnable score-fusion strategy
using a Mixture of Experts (MoE). We introduce a novel pseudo-quality loss for
quality estimation with a modality-specific Quality Estimator (QE), and a score
triplet loss to improve the metric performance. Extensive experiments on
multiple whole-body biometric datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our
proposed approach, achieving state-of-the-art results across various metrics
compared to baseline methods. Our method is effective for multimodal and
multi-model, addressing key challenges such as model misalignment in the
similarity score domain and variability in data quality.

### [2] [Punching Bag vs. Punching Person: Motion Transferability in Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00085)
*Raiyaan Abdullah,Jared Claypoole,Michael Cogswell,Ajay Divakaran,Yogesh Rawat*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文探讨了动作识别模型在高层次动作概念跨多样上下文中的迁移能力，发现模型在新颖情境下性能显著下降，并提出了改进方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动作识别模型是否能有效迁移高层次动作概念（如“拳击”）到不同上下文（如“拳击人”），以评估其泛化能力。

Method: 引入了一个运动迁移性框架，使用三个数据集（Syn-TA、Kinetics400-TA、Something-Something-v2-TA）评估了13个先进模型。

Result: 模型在新颖情境下性能显著下降，尤其是多模态模型在细粒度动作上表现更差；Syn-TA数据集与真实数据集同样具有挑战性；大模型在空间线索主导时表现更好，但在时间推理上表现较差。

Conclusion: 通过解耦粗粒度和细粒度动作可以提高识别性能，该研究为动作识别中的运动迁移性评估提供了重要基准。

Abstract: Action recognition models demonstrate strong generalization, but can they
effectively transfer high-level motion concepts across diverse contexts, even
within similar distributions? For example, can a model recognize the broad
action "punching" when presented with an unseen variation such as "punching
person"? To explore this, we introduce a motion transferability framework with
three datasets: (1) Syn-TA, a synthetic dataset with 3D object motions; (2)
Kinetics400-TA; and (3) Something-Something-v2-TA, both adapted from natural
video datasets. We evaluate 13 state-of-the-art models on these benchmarks and
observe a significant drop in performance when recognizing high-level actions
in novel contexts. Our analysis reveals: 1) Multimodal models struggle more
with fine-grained unknown actions than with coarse ones; 2) The bias-free
Syn-TA proves as challenging as real-world datasets, with models showing
greater performance drops in controlled settings; 3) Larger models improve
transferability when spatial cues dominate but struggle with intensive temporal
reasoning, while reliance on object and background cues hinders generalization.
We further explore how disentangling coarse and fine motions can improve
recognition in temporally challenging datasets. We believe this study
establishes a crucial benchmark for assessing motion transferability in action
recognition. Datasets and relevant code:

### [3] [The Monado SLAM Dataset for Egocentric Visual-Inertial Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00088)
*Mateo de Mayo,Daniel Cremers,Taihú Pire*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了Monado SLAM数据集，旨在解决现有VIO/SLAM系统在头戴式设备应用中面临的挑战性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VIO/SLAM系统在头戴式设备应用中难以应对高动态运动、遮挡、低纹理环境等现实问题，缺乏相关数据集。

Method: 通过收集多款虚拟现实头戴设备的真实序列数据，构建Monado SLAM数据集。

Result: 发布了Monado SLAM数据集，采用CC BY 4.0许可，以推动VIO/SLAM研究。

Conclusion: Monado SLAM数据集填补了现有研究空白，有助于改进头戴式设备的跟踪系统。

Abstract: Humanoid robots and mixed reality headsets benefit from the use of
head-mounted sensors for tracking. While advancements in visual-inertial
odometry (VIO) and simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) have produced
new and high-quality state-of-the-art tracking systems, we show that these are
still unable to gracefully handle many of the challenging settings presented in
the head-mounted use cases. Common scenarios like high-intensity motions,
dynamic occlusions, long tracking sessions, low-textured areas, adverse
lighting conditions, saturation of sensors, to name a few, continue to be
covered poorly by existing datasets in the literature. In this way, systems may
inadvertently overlook these essential real-world issues. To address this, we
present the Monado SLAM dataset, a set of real sequences taken from multiple
virtual reality headsets. We release the dataset under a permissive CC BY 4.0
license, to drive advancements in VIO/SLAM research and development.

### [4] [Exploring the Feasibility of Deep Learning Techniques for Accurate Gender Classification from Eye Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00135)
*Basna Mohammed Salih Hasan,Ramadhan J. Mstafa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于卷积神经网络（CNN）的模型，利用眼周区域的颜色图像进行性别分类，在CVBL和（Female and Male）数据集上分别达到99%和96%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 性别分类在安全、人机交互等领域至关重要，但化妆品和伪装等因素会影响分类准确性，因此研究专注于眼周区域以提高分类效果。

Method: 使用CNN模型分析眼周区域的颜色图像，提取关键特征进行性别分类，并在两个数据集上进行验证。

Result: 模型在CVBL数据集上达到99%的准确率，在（Female and Male）数据集上达到96%的准确率，参数数量较少（7,235,089）。

Conclusion: 该模型在性别分类中表现出色，适用于安全和监控等实际应用。

Abstract: Gender classification has emerged as a crucial aspect in various fields,
including security, human-machine interaction, surveillance, and advertising.
Nonetheless, the accuracy of this classification can be influenced by factors
such as cosmetics and disguise. Consequently, our study is dedicated to
addressing this concern by concentrating on gender classification using color
images of the periocular region. The periocular region refers to the area
surrounding the eye, including the eyelids, eyebrows, and the region between
them. It contains valuable visual cues that can be used to extract key features
for gender classification. This paper introduces a sophisticated Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) model that utilizes color image databases to evaluate the
effectiveness of the periocular region for gender classification. To validate
the model's performance, we conducted tests on two eye datasets, namely CVBL
and (Female and Male). The recommended architecture achieved an outstanding
accuracy of 99% on the previously unused CVBL dataset while attaining a
commendable accuracy of 96% with a small number of learnable parameters
(7,235,089) on the (Female and Male) dataset. To ascertain the effectiveness of
our proposed model for gender classification using the periocular region, we
evaluated its performance through an extensive range of metrics and compared it
with other state-of-the-art approaches. The results unequivocally demonstrate
the efficacy of our model, thereby suggesting its potential for practical
application in domains such as security and surveillance.

### [5] [World Consistency Score: A Unified Metric for Video Generation Quality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00144)
*Akshat Rakheja,Aarsh Ashdhir,Aryan Bhattacharjee,Vanshika Sharma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: World Consistency Score (WCS) 是一种新的生成视频模型评估指标，强调视频内部的世界一致性，整合了四个可解释的子组件，并通过学习权重公式生成一致性分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频评估指标主要关注视觉保真度或提示对齐，忽略了视频的时空和物理一致性，WCS旨在填补这一空白。

Method: WCS 包含四个子指标（物体持久性、关系稳定性、因果合规性和闪烁惩罚），通过开源工具计算，并通过人类偏好数据学习权重。

Result: WCS 在多个基准测试中验证了其与人类评价的相关性，并与其他指标（如 FVD、CLIPScore）进行了比较。

Conclusion: WCS 提供了一个全面且可解释的框架，用于评估生成视频模型在保持世界一致性方面的能力。

Abstract: We introduce World Consistency Score (WCS), a novel unified evaluation metric
for generative video models that emphasizes internal world consistency of the
generated videos. WCS integrates four interpretable sub-components - object
permanence, relation stability, causal compliance, and flicker penalty - each
measuring a distinct aspect of temporal and physical coherence in a video.
These submetrics are combined via a learned weighted formula to produce a
single consistency score that aligns with human judgments. We detail the
motivation for WCS in the context of existing video evaluation metrics,
formalize each submetric and how it is computed with open-source tools
(trackers, action recognizers, CLIP embeddings, optical flow), and describe how
the weights of the WCS combination are trained using human preference data. We
also outline an experimental validation blueprint: using benchmarks like
VBench-2.0, EvalCrafter, and LOVE to test WCS's correlation with human
evaluations, performing sensitivity analyses, and comparing WCS against
established metrics (FVD, CLIPScore, VBench, FVMD). The proposed WCS offers a
comprehensive and interpretable framework for evaluating video generation
models on their ability to maintain a coherent "world" over time, addressing
gaps left by prior metrics focused only on visual fidelity or prompt alignment.

### [6] [GeoExplorer: Active Geo-localization with Curiosity-Driven Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00152)
*Li Mi,Manon Bechaz,Zeming Chen,Antoine Bosselut,Devis Tuia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoExplorer通过好奇心驱动的探索改进主动地理定位任务，提升了在陌生目标和环境中的鲁棒性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于距离奖励的强化学习方法在距离估计困难或面对陌生目标和环境时表现不佳，缺乏可靠的探索策略。

Method: 提出GeoExplorer，引入好奇心驱动的内在奖励，进行目标无关的多样化探索。

Result: 在四个AGL基准测试中验证了GeoExplorer的有效性和泛化能力，尤其在陌生目标和环境中表现突出。

Conclusion: 好奇心驱动的探索策略显著提升了AGL任务的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Active Geo-localization (AGL) is the task of localizing a goal, represented
in various modalities (e.g., aerial images, ground-level images, or text),
within a predefined search area. Current methods approach AGL as a
goal-reaching reinforcement learning (RL) problem with a distance-based reward.
They localize the goal by implicitly learning to minimize the relative distance
from it. However, when distance estimation becomes challenging or when
encountering unseen targets and environments, the agent exhibits reduced
robustness and generalization ability due to the less reliable exploration
strategy learned during training. In this paper, we propose GeoExplorer, an AGL
agent that incorporates curiosity-driven exploration through intrinsic rewards.
Unlike distance-based rewards, our curiosity-driven reward is goal-agnostic,
enabling robust, diverse, and contextually relevant exploration based on
effective environment modeling. These capabilities have been proven through
extensive experiments across four AGL benchmarks, demonstrating the
effectiveness and generalization ability of GeoExplorer in diverse settings,
particularly in localizing unfamiliar targets and environments.

### [7] [Robust 3D Object Detection using Probabilistic Point Clouds from Single-Photon LiDARs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00169)
*Bhavya Goyal,Felipe Gutierrez-Barragan,Wei Lin,Andreas Velten,Yin Li,Mohit Gupta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为概率点云（PPC）的新型3D场景表示方法，通过为每个点添加概率属性来封装原始数据中的测量不确定性，从而提升3D物体检测的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代LiDAR在远距离或低反射率物体等场景中会产生稀疏或错误的点云，这些误差会传播到下游感知模型中，导致精度下降。传统3D处理流程未保留原始测量中的不确定性信息。

Method: 提出PPC表示方法，为点云中的每个点添加概率属性，并基于PPC设计轻量级推理模块，用于鲁棒的3D物体检测。

Result: 通过仿真和实际数据验证，PPC方法在室内外场景中优于LiDAR及相机-LiDAR融合模型，尤其在处理小、远距离、低反射率物体及强环境光时表现更优。

Conclusion: PPC通过引入概率属性有效提升了3D物体检测的鲁棒性，尤其在复杂场景中表现突出。

Abstract: LiDAR-based 3D sensors provide point clouds, a canonical 3D representation
used in various scene understanding tasks. Modern LiDARs face key challenges in
several real-world scenarios, such as long-distance or low-albedo objects,
producing sparse or erroneous point clouds. These errors, which are rooted in
the noisy raw LiDAR measurements, get propagated to downstream perception
models, resulting in potentially severe loss of accuracy. This is because
conventional 3D processing pipelines do not retain any uncertainty information
from the raw measurements when constructing point clouds.
  We propose Probabilistic Point Clouds (PPC), a novel 3D scene representation
where each point is augmented with a probability attribute that encapsulates
the measurement uncertainty (or confidence) in the raw data. We further
introduce inference approaches that leverage PPC for robust 3D object
detection; these methods are versatile and can be used as computationally
lightweight drop-in modules in 3D inference pipelines. We demonstrate, via both
simulations and real captures, that PPC-based 3D inference methods outperform
several baselines using LiDAR as well as camera-LiDAR fusion models, across
challenging indoor and outdoor scenarios involving small, distant, and
low-albedo objects, as well as strong ambient light.

### [8] [On the Risk of Misleading Reports: Diagnosing Textual Biases in Multimodal Clinical AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00171)
*David Restrepo,Ira Ktena,Maria Vakalopoulou,Stergios Christodoulidis,Enzo Ferrante*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为选择性模态转移（SMS）的方法，用于量化视觉语言模型（VLMs）在二元分类任务中对图像和文本模态的依赖程度，揭示了模型对文本输入的显著偏好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床决策依赖于医学图像和相关临床报告的综合分析，但现有的视觉语言模型（VLMs）可能偏向于某一模态（如文本），而忽略关键的视觉信息。

Method: 通过选择性模态转移（SMS）方法，系统地交换样本中的图像或文本以暴露模态特异性偏差，评估了六个开源VLMs在两个医学影像数据集上的表现。

Result: 研究发现，模型在未扰动和扰动设置下均表现出对文本输入的显著依赖，视觉信息常被文本细节掩盖。

Conclusion: 强调了设计和评估真正整合视觉和文本线索的多模态医学模型的重要性。

Abstract: Clinical decision-making relies on the integrated analysis of medical images
and the associated clinical reports. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can
offer a unified framework for such tasks, they can exhibit strong biases toward
one modality, frequently overlooking critical visual cues in favor of textual
information. In this work, we introduce Selective Modality Shifting (SMS), a
perturbation-based approach to quantify a model's reliance on each modality in
binary classification tasks. By systematically swapping images or text between
samples with opposing labels, we expose modality-specific biases. We assess six
open-source VLMs-four generalist models and two fine-tuned for medical data-on
two medical imaging datasets with distinct modalities: MIMIC-CXR (chest X-ray)
and FairVLMed (scanning laser ophthalmoscopy). By assessing model performance
and the calibration of every model in both unperturbed and perturbed settings,
we reveal a marked dependency on text input, which persists despite the
presence of complementary visual information. We also perform a qualitative
attention-based analysis which further confirms that image content is often
overshadowed by text details. Our findings highlight the importance of
designing and evaluating multimodal medical models that genuinely integrate
visual and textual cues, rather than relying on single-modality signals.

### [9] [Graph Lineages and Skeletal Graph Products](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00197)
*Eric Mjolsness,Cory B. Scott*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文定义了一种结构化图谱系（graph lineages），用于描述层次化增长的图结构，并提出了低成本的“骨架”代数操作和类型构造器，适用于层次化模型架构和算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在为机器学习和计算科学中的层次化模型架构提供一种数学框架，通过图谱系和骨架操作实现高效的计算和建模。

Method: 定义了层次化增长的图谱系，引入骨架代数操作和类型构造器（如交叉积、盒积、不相交和等），并推导了空间高效的一元操作（如增厚和升级）。

Result: 提出了一种适用于层次化图谱系的代数类型理论，展示了其在深度神经网络和多网格数值方法中的应用。

Conclusion: 该方法为层次化模型架构和局部算法提供了高效的数学工具，适用于多种领域。

Abstract: Graphs, and sequences of growing graphs, can be used to specify the
architecture of mathematical models in many fields including machine learning
and computational science. Here we define structured graph "lineages" (ordered
by level number) that grow in a hierarchical fashion, so that: (1) the number
of graph vertices and edges increases exponentially in level number; (2)
bipartite graphs connect successive levels within a graph lineage and, as in
multigrid methods, can constrain matrices relating successive levels; (3) using
prolongation maps within a graph lineage, process-derived distance measures
between graphs at successive levels can be defined; (4) a category of "graded
graphs" can be defined, and using it low-cost "skeletal" variants of standard
algebraic graph operations and type constructors (cross product, box product,
disjoint sum, and function types) can be derived for graded graphs and hence
hierarchical graph lineages; (5) these skeletal binary operators have similar
but not identical algebraic and category-theoretic properties to their standard
counterparts; (6) graph lineages and their skeletal product constructors can
approach continuum limit objects. Additional space-efficient unary operators on
graded graphs are also derived: thickening, which creates a graph lineage of
multiscale graphs, and escalation to a graph lineage of search frontiers
(useful as a generalization of adaptive grids and in defining "skeletal"
functions). The result is an algebraic type theory for graded graphs and
(hierarchical) graph lineages. The approach is expected to be well suited to
defining hierarchical model architectures - "hierarchitectures" - and local
sampling, search, or optimization algorithms on them. We demonstrate such
application to deep neural networks (including visual and feature scale spaces)
and to multigrid numerical methods.

### [10] [Learning Personalised Human Internal Cognition from External Expressive Behaviours for Real Personality Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00205)
*Xiangyu Kong,Hengde Zhu,Haoqin Sun,Zhihao Guo,Jiayan Gu,Xinyi Ni,Wei Zhang,Shizhe Liu,Siyang Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于个性化内部认知的自动真实人格识别方法，通过模拟目标个体的内部认知，利用2D图神经网络从外部行为推断真实人格特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常作为外部观察者推断人格印象，与真实人格偏差较大，性能较差。本文受真实人格与内部认知关联的启发，提出新方法。

Method: 模拟个性化内部认知，将其表示为网络权重，构建包含二维节点和边特征矩阵的图，并提出2D-GNN进行人格推断。采用端到端策略联合训练模块。

Result: 通过模拟内部认知和2D-GNN，实现了更准确的真实人格识别。

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合内部认知模拟和图神经网络，显著提升了真实人格识别的性能。

Abstract: Automatic real personality recognition (RPR) aims to evaluate human real
personality traits from their expressive behaviours. However, most existing
solutions generally act as external observers to infer observers' personality
impressions based on target individuals' expressive behaviours, which
significantly deviate from their real personalities and consistently lead to
inferior recognition performance. Inspired by the association between real
personality and human internal cognition underlying the generation of
expressive behaviours, we propose a novel RPR approach that efficiently
simulates personalised internal cognition from easy-accessible external short
audio-visual behaviours expressed by the target individual. The simulated
personalised cognition, represented as a set of network weights that enforce
the personalised network to reproduce the individual-specific facial reactions,
is further encoded as a novel graph containing two-dimensional node and edge
feature matrices, with a novel 2D Graph Neural Network (2D-GNN) proposed for
inferring real personality traits from it. To simulate real personality-related
cognition, an end-to-end strategy is designed to jointly train our cognition
simulation, 2D graph construction, and personality recognition modules.

*Shayan Jalilian,Abdul Bais*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAM-PTx通过轻量级适配器设计将CLIP文本嵌入注入SAM的图像编码器，提升语义引导的分割性能，同时保持大部分架构冻结。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索语义文本提示在SAM中的潜力，弥补传统空间提示的不足。

Method: 提出Parallel-Text适配器，仅修改MLP并行分支，保留注意力路径以支持空间推理。

Result: 在COD10K、COCO和ADE20K数据集上，固定文本嵌入输入显著优于纯空间提示基线。

Conclusion: 语义条件集成是SAM高效适配的实用且可扩展路径。

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) has demonstrated impressive generalization
in prompt-based segmentation. Yet, the potential of semantic text prompts
remains underexplored compared to traditional spatial prompts like points and
boxes. This paper introduces SAM-PTx, a parameter-efficient approach for
adapting SAM using frozen CLIP-derived text embeddings as class-level semantic
guidance. Specifically, we propose a lightweight adapter design called
Parallel-Text that injects text embeddings into SAM's image encoder, enabling
semantics-guided segmentation while keeping most of the original architecture
frozen. Our adapter modifies only the MLP-parallel branch of each transformer
block, preserving the attention pathway for spatial reasoning. Through
supervised experiments and ablations on the COD10K dataset as well as low-data
subsets of COCO and ADE20K, we show that incorporating fixed text embeddings as
input improves segmentation performance over purely spatial prompt baselines.
To our knowledge, this is the first work to use text prompts for segmentation
on the COD10K dataset. These results suggest that integrating semantic
conditioning into SAM's architecture offers a practical and scalable path for
efficient adaptation with minimal computational complexity.

*Aymane Abdali,Bartosz Boguslawski,Lucas Drumetz,Vincent Gripon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 在少样本图像分类中，通过引入对象的局部位置信息显著提升性能，尤其是使用Segment Anything Model或无监督前景提取方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决少样本图像分类中因图像模糊（如多对象或复杂背景）导致的性能下降问题。

Method: 利用对象的局部位置信息，结合Segment Anything Model（仅需标记一个像素）或无监督前景提取方法。

Result: 在多个基准测试中显著提升了分类性能。

Conclusion: 局部位置信息和简单标记方法能有效提升少样本图像分类的性能。

Abstract: In the domain of Few-Shot Image Classification, operating with as little as
one example per class, the presence of image ambiguities stemming from multiple
objects or complex backgrounds can significantly deteriorate performance. Our
research demonstrates that incorporating additional information about the local
positioning of an object within its image markedly enhances classification
across established benchmarks. More importantly, we show that a significant
fraction of the improvement can be achieved through the use of the Segment
Anything Model, requiring only a pixel of the object of interest to be pointed
out, or by employing fully unsupervised foreground object extraction methods.

### [13] [Guided Depth Map Super-Resolution via Multi-Scale Fusion U-shaped Mamba Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00248)
*Chenggang Guo,Hao Xu,XianMing Wan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种多尺度融合U形Mamba模型（MSF-UM），用于深度图超分辨率任务，结合Mamba的高效状态空间建模能力和多尺度结构，显著提升重建精度并减少参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统卷积神经网络在处理长距离依赖和全局上下文信息时存在局限，而Transformer的计算复杂度和内存消耗过高，限制了其在高分辨率深度图处理中的应用。

Method: 设计了结合残差密集通道注意力块和Mamba状态空间模块的多尺度U形融合结构，利用彩色图像的高频纹理信息指导深度图超分辨率。

Result: 模型在多个公开数据集上验证了有效性，显著减少了参数数量并提升了重建精度，尤其在大规模深度图超分辨率任务中表现出色。

Conclusion: MSF-UM模型通过结合局部特征提取和长距离依赖建模，以及多尺度跨模态融合策略，为深度图超分辨率提供了一种高效且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Depth map super-resolution technology aims to improve the spatial resolution
of low-resolution depth maps and effectively restore high-frequency detail
information. Traditional convolutional neural network has limitations in
dealing with long-range dependencies and are unable to fully model the global
contextual information in depth maps. Although transformer can model global
dependencies, its computational complexity and memory consumption are
quadratic, which significantly limits its ability to process high-resolution
depth maps. In this paper, we propose a multi-scale fusion U-shaped Mamba
(MSF-UM) model, a novel guided depth map super-resolution framework. The core
innovation of this model is to integrate Mamba's efficient state-space modeling
capabilities into a multi-scale U-shaped fusion structure guided by a color
image. The structure combining the residual dense channel attention block and
the Mamba state space module is designed, which combines the local feature
extraction capability of the convolutional layer with the modeling advantage of
the state space model for long-distance dependencies. At the same time, the
model adopts a multi-scale cross-modal fusion strategy to make full use of the
high-frequency texture information from the color image to guide the
super-resolution process of the depth map. Compared with existing mainstream
methods, the proposed MSF-UM significantly reduces the number of model
parameters while achieving better reconstruction accuracy. Extensive
experiments on multiple publicly available datasets validate the effectiveness
of the model, especially showing excellent generalization ability in the task
of large-scale depth map super-resolution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在初始化时间长和多视角一致性差的问题，PointGauss旨在通过点云分割驱动的流程直接解析高斯基元，解决这些问题。

Method: 方法包括点云高斯基元解码器（1分钟内生成3D实例掩码）和GPU加速的2D掩码渲染系统（确保多视角一致性）。

Result: 实验显示性能提升1.89%至31.78%（多视角mIoU），并保持计算高效。同时提出了新数据集DesktopObjects-360。

Conclusion: PointGauss在3D分割中表现出色，解决了现有方法的局限性，并通过新数据集推动了领域发展。

Abstract: We introduce PointGauss, a novel point cloud-guided framework for real-time
multi-object segmentation in Gaussian Splatting representations. Unlike
existing methods that suffer from prolonged initialization and limited
multi-view consistency, our approach achieves efficient 3D segmentation by
directly parsing Gaussian primitives through a point cloud segmentation-driven
pipeline. The key innovation lies in two aspects: (1) a point cloud-based
Gaussian primitive decoder that generates 3D instance masks within 1 minute,
and (2) a GPU-accelerated 2D mask rendering system that ensures multi-view
consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant improvements over
previous state-of-the-art methods, achieving performance gains of 1.89 to
31.78% in multi-view mIoU, while maintaining superior computational efficiency.
To address the limitations of current benchmarks (single-object focus,
inconsistent 3D evaluation, small scale, and partial coverage), we present
DesktopObjects-360, a novel comprehensive dataset for 3D segmentation in
radiance fields, featuring: (1) complex multi-object scenes, (2) globally
consistent 2D annotations, (3) large-scale training data (over 27 thousand 2D
masks), (4) full 360{\deg} coverage, and (5) 3D evaluation masks.

Abstract: Continual learning enables pre-trained generative vision-language models
(VLMs) to incorporate knowledge from new tasks without retraining data from
previous ones. Recent methods update a visual projector to translate visual
information for new tasks, connecting pre-trained vision encoders with large
language models. However, such adjustments may cause the models to prioritize
visual inputs over language instructions, particularly learning tasks with
repetitive types of textual instructions. To address the neglect of language
instructions, we propose a novel framework that grounds the translation of
visual information on instructions for language models. We introduce a mixture
of visual projectors, each serving as a specialized visual-to-language
translation expert based on the given instruction context to adapt to new
tasks. To avoid using experts for irrelevant instruction contexts, we propose
an expert recommendation strategy that reuses experts for tasks similar to
those previously learned. Additionally, we introduce expert pruning to
alleviate interference from the use of experts that cumulatively activated in
previous tasks. Extensive experiments on diverse vision-language tasks
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing continual learning approaches
by generating instruction-following responses.

Abstract: Pedestrian detection models in autonomous driving systems often lack
robustness due to insufficient representation of dangerous pedestrian scenarios
in training datasets. To address this limitation, we present a novel framework
for controllable pedestrian video editing in multi-view driving scenarios by
integrating video inpainting and human motion control techniques. Our approach
begins by identifying pedestrian regions of interest across multiple camera
views, expanding detection bounding boxes with a fixed ratio, and resizing and
stitching these regions into a unified canvas while preserving cross-view
spatial relationships. A binary mask is then applied to designate the editable
area, within which pedestrian editing is guided by pose sequence control
conditions. This enables flexible editing functionalities, including pedestrian
insertion, replacement, and removal. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
framework achieves high-quality pedestrian editing with strong visual realism,
spatiotemporal coherence, and cross-view consistency. These results establish
the proposed method as a robust and versatile solution for multi-view
pedestrian video generation, with broad potential for applications in data
augmentation and scenario simulation in autonomous driving.

Abstract: Multimodal referring segmentation aims to segment target objects in visual
scenes, such as images, videos, and 3D scenes, based on referring expressions
in text or audio format. This task plays a crucial role in practical
applications requiring accurate object perception based on user instructions.
Over the past decade, it has gained significant attention in the multimodal
community, driven by advances in convolutional neural networks, transformers,
and large language models, all of which have substantially improved multimodal
perception capabilities. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of
multimodal referring segmentation. We begin by introducing this field's
background, including problem definitions and commonly used datasets. Next, we
summarize a unified meta architecture for referring segmentation and review
representative methods across three primary visual scenes, including images,
videos, and 3D scenes. We further discuss Generalized Referring Expression
(GREx) methods to address the challenges of real-world complexity, along with
related tasks and practical applications. Extensive performance comparisons on
standard benchmarks are also provided. We continually track related works at

Result: AerialCSP显著提升真实场景中的缺陷检测能力，尤其是对小而罕见缺陷的检测，减少手动标注需求。

Conclusion: AerialCSP为CSP植物航拍图像任务提供了高质量合成数据，有效解决了实际数据标注难题。

Abstract: In the context of Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) plants, aerial images
captured by drones present a unique set of challenges. Unlike urban or natural
landscapes commonly found in existing datasets, solar fields contain highly
reflective surfaces, and domain-specific elements that are uncommon in
traditional computer vision benchmarks. As a result, machine learning models
trained on generic datasets struggle to generalize to this setting without
extensive retraining and large volumes of annotated data. However, collecting
and labeling such data is costly and time-consuming, making it impractical for
rapid deployment in industrial applications.
  To address this issue, we propose a novel approach: the creation of
AerialCSP, a virtual dataset that simulates aerial imagery of CSP plants. By
generating synthetic data that closely mimic real-world conditions, our
objective is to facilitate pretraining of models before deployment,
significantly reducing the need for extensive manual labeling. Our main
contributions are threefold: (1) we introduce AerialCSP, a high-quality
synthetic dataset for aerial inspection of CSP plants, providing annotated data
for object detection and image segmentation; (2) we benchmark multiple models
on AerialCSP, establishing a baseline for CSP-related vision tasks; and (3) we
demonstrate that pretraining on AerialCSP significantly improves real-world
fault detection, particularly for rare and small defects, reducing the need for
extensive manual labeling. AerialCSP is made publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语义对应是计算机视觉中的基础任务，但在恶劣条件下的鲁棒性研究不足，需要建立新基准以评估其性能。

Method: 构建包含14种挑战性场景的数据集，评估现有方法和大规模视觉模型（如DINO和Stable Diffusion）的鲁棒性。

Result: 现有方法在恶劣条件下表现下降；大规模视觉模型提升鲁棒性，但微调会降低相对鲁棒性；DINO优于Stable Diffusion，融合策略效果更好。

Conclusion: 需要任务特定的鲁棒性增强设计，通用数据增强无效，研究结果在真实场景中一致。

Abstract: Semantic correspondence aims to identify semantically meaningful
relationships between different images and is a fundamental challenge in
computer vision. It forms the foundation for numerous tasks such as 3D
reconstruction, object tracking, and image editing. With the progress of
large-scale vision models, semantic correspondence has achieved remarkable
performance in controlled and high-quality conditions. However, the robustness
of semantic correspondence in challenging scenarios is much less investigated.
In this work, we establish a novel benchmark for evaluating semantic
correspondence in adverse conditions. The benchmark dataset comprises 14
distinct challenging scenarios that reflect commonly encountered imaging
issues, including geometric distortion, image blurring, digital artifacts, and
environmental occlusion. Through extensive evaluations, we provide several key
insights into the robustness of semantic correspondence approaches: (1) All
existing methods suffer from noticeable performance drops under adverse
conditions; (2) Using large-scale vision models can enhance overall robustness,
but fine-tuning on these models leads to a decline in relative robustness; (3)
The DINO model outperforms the Stable Diffusion in relative robustness, and
their fusion achieves better absolute robustness; Moreover, We evaluate common
robustness enhancement strategies for semantic correspondence and find that
general data augmentations are ineffective, highlighting the need for
task-specific designs. These results are consistent across both our dataset and
real-world benchmarks.

Result: 在WayMoCo数据集上，方法比现有最优模型的检索准确率高出27.5%。

Conclusion: 提出的框架为自动驾驶系统在多样化人类行为场景中的评估提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems must operate reliably in safety-critical
scenarios, particularly those involving unusual or complex behavior by
Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs). Identifying these edge cases in driving datasets
is essential for robust evaluation and generalization, but retrieving such rare
human behavior scenarios within the long tail of large-scale datasets is
challenging. To support targeted evaluation of autonomous driving systems in
diverse, human-centered scenarios, we propose a novel context-aware motion
retrieval framework. Our method combines Skinned Multi-Person Linear
(SMPL)-based motion sequences and corresponding video frames before encoding
them into a shared multimodal embedding space aligned with natural language.
Our approach enables the scalable retrieval of human behavior and their context
through text queries. This work also introduces our dataset WayMoCo, an
extension of the Waymo Open Dataset. It contains automatically labeled motion
and scene context descriptions derived from generated pseudo-ground-truth SMPL
sequences and corresponding image data. Our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art models by up to 27.5% accuracy in motion-context retrieval,
when evaluated on the WayMoCo dataset.

Conclusion: 该框架有效处理真实数据多样性，有望应用于智能交通系统，提升道路安全。

Abstract: Driver drowsiness is one of the main causes of road accidents and is
recognized as a leading contributor to traffic-related fatalities. However,
detecting drowsiness accurately remains a challenging task, especially in
real-world settings where facial data from different individuals is
decentralized and highly diverse. In this paper, we propose a novel framework
for drowsiness detection that is designed to work effectively with
heterogeneous and decentralized data. Our approach develops a new Spatial
Self-Attention (SSA) mechanism integrated with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
network to better extract key facial features and improve detection
performance. To support federated learning, we employ a Gradient Similarity
Comparison (GSC) that selects the most relevant trained models from different
operators before aggregation. This improves the accuracy and robustness of the
global model while preserving user privacy. We also develop a customized tool
that automatically processes video data by extracting frames, detecting and
cropping faces, and applying data augmentation techniques such as rotation,
flipping, brightness adjustment, and zooming. Experimental results show that
our framework achieves a detection accuracy of 89.9% in the federated learning
settings, outperforming existing methods under various deployment scenarios.
The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in handling
real-world data variability and highlight its potential for deployment in
intelligent transportation systems to enhance road safety through early and
reliable drowsiness detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法无法充分建模3D环境与目标图像之间的几何关系，导致导航效率低下。

Method: 采用增量式3D高斯表示更新场景，结合粗定位和细定位策略，利用几何信息匹配和可微分渲染优化目标姿态。

Result: IGL-Nav在多种实验配置下显著优于现有方法，并能处理自由视角图像目标导航任务。

Conclusion: IGL-Nav通过高效3D感知和优化策略，实现了高性能的图像目标导航，适用于实际机器人平台。

Abstract: Visual navigation with an image as goal is a fundamental and challenging
problem. Conventional methods either rely on end-to-end RL learning or
modular-based policy with topological graph or BEV map as memory, which cannot
fully model the geometric relationship between the explored 3D environment and
the goal image. In order to efficiently and accurately localize the goal image
in 3D space, we build our navigation system upon the renderable 3D gaussian
(3DGS) representation. However, due to the computational intensity of 3DGS
optimization and the large search space of 6-DoF camera pose, directly
leveraging 3DGS for image localization during agent exploration process is
prohibitively inefficient. To this end, we propose IGL-Nav, an Incremental 3D
Gaussian Localization framework for efficient and 3D-aware image-goal
navigation. Specifically, we incrementally update the scene representation as
new images arrive with feed-forward monocular prediction. Then we coarsely
localize the goal by leveraging the geometric information for discrete space
matching, which can be equivalent to efficient 3D convolution. When the agent
is close to the goal, we finally solve the fine target pose with optimization
via differentiable rendering. The proposed IGL-Nav outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods by a large margin across diverse experimental
configurations. It can also handle the more challenging free-view image-goal
setting and be deployed on real-world robotic platform using a cellphone to
capture goal image at arbitrary pose. Project page:

Conclusion: TITAN-Guide不仅降低了内存需求，还在多个扩散引导基准测试中表现出色。

Abstract: In the recent development of conditional diffusion models still require heavy
supervised fine-tuning for performing control on a category of tasks.
Training-free conditioning via guidance with off-the-shelf models is a
favorable alternative to avoid further fine-tuning on the base model. However,
the existing training-free guidance frameworks either have heavy memory
requirements or offer sub-optimal control due to rough estimation. These
shortcomings limit the applicability to control diffusion models that require
intense computation, such as Text-to-Video (T2V) diffusion models. In this
work, we propose Taming Inference Time Alignment for Guided Text-to-Video
Diffusion Model, so-called TITAN-Guide, which overcomes memory space issues,
and provides more optimal control in the guidance process compared to the
counterparts. In particular, we develop an efficient method for optimizing
diffusion latents without backpropagation from a discriminative guiding model.
In particular, we study forward gradient descents for guided diffusion tasks
with various options on directional directives. In our experiments, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in efficiently managing memory
during latent optimization, while previous methods fall short. Our proposed
approach not only minimizes memory requirements but also significantly enhances
T2V performance across a range of diffusion guidance benchmarks. Code, models,

Conclusion: AniMer+的网络架构和合成数据集有效提升了真实应用性能，解决了多物种3D数据稀缺问题。

Abstract: In the era of foundation models, achieving a unified understanding of
different dynamic objects through a single network has the potential to empower
stronger spatial intelligence. Moreover, accurate estimation of animal pose and
shape across diverse species is essential for quantitative analysis in
biological research. However, this topic remains underexplored due to the
limited network capacity of previous methods and the scarcity of comprehensive
multi-species datasets. To address these limitations, we introduce AniMer+, an
extended version of our scalable AniMer framework. In this paper, we focus on a
unified approach for reconstructing mammals (mammalia) and birds (aves). A key
innovation of AniMer+ is its high-capacity, family-aware Vision Transformer
(ViT) incorporating a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) design. Its architecture
partitions network layers into taxa-specific components (for mammalia and aves)
and taxa-shared components, enabling efficient learning of both distinct and
common anatomical features within a single model. To overcome the critical
shortage of 3D training data, especially for birds, we introduce a
diffusion-based conditional image generation pipeline. This pipeline produces
two large-scale synthetic datasets: CtrlAni3D for quadrupeds and CtrlAVES3D for
birds. To note, CtrlAVES3D is the first large-scale, 3D-annotated dataset for
birds, which is crucial for resolving single-view depth ambiguities. Trained on
an aggregated collection of 41.3k mammalian and 12.4k avian images (combining
real and synthetic data), our method demonstrates superior performance over
existing approaches across a wide range of benchmarks, including the
challenging out-of-domain Animal Kingdom dataset. Ablation studies confirm the
effectiveness of both our novel network architecture and the generated
synthetic datasets in enhancing real-world application performance.

Method: 将增强流程分为可见性恢复和结构细化两阶段，分别设计网络和融合策略，并引入对比损失。

Result: 实验表明，该方法优于现有最优模型。

Conclusion: 通过解耦和动态对齐策略，有效提升了低光图像增强的性能。

Abstract: The event camera, benefiting from its high dynamic range and low latency,
provides performance gain for low-light image enhancement. Unlike frame-based
cameras, it records intensity changes with extremely high temporal resolution,
capturing sufficient structure information. Currently, existing event-based
methods feed a frame and events directly into a single model without fully
exploiting modality-specific advantages, which limits their performance.
Therefore, by analyzing the role of each sensing modality, the enhancement
pipeline is decoupled into two stages: visibility restoration and structure
refinement. In the first stage, we design a visibility restoration network with
amplitude-phase entanglement by rethinking the relationship between amplitude
and phase components in Fourier space. In the second stage, a fusion strategy
with dynamic alignment is proposed to mitigate the spatial mismatch caused by
the temporal resolution discrepancy between two sensing modalities, aiming to
refine the structure information of the image enhanced by the visibility
restoration network. In addition, we utilize spatial-frequency interpolation to
simulate negative samples with diverse illumination, noise and artifact
degradations, thereby developing a contrastive loss that encourages the model
to learn discriminative representations. Experiments demonstrate that the
proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art models.

complex formulas at the line, paragraph, and page levels. Through
straightforward supervised fine-tuning, our approach achieves state-of-the-art

Conclusion: GV-VAD框架通过合成数据增强和优化训练策略，有效提升了视频异常检测的性能。

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) plays a critical role in public safety
applications such as intelligent surveillance. However, the rarity,
unpredictability, and high annotation cost of real-world anomalies make it
difficult to scale VAD datasets, which limits the performance and
generalization ability of existing models. To address this challenge, we
propose a generative video-enhanced weakly-supervised video anomaly detection
(GV-VAD) framework that leverages text-conditioned video generation models to
produce semantically controllable and physically plausible synthetic videos.
These virtual videos are used to augment training data at low cost. In
addition, a synthetic sample loss scaling strategy is utilized to control the
influence of generated synthetic samples for efficient training. The
experiments show that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art
methods on UCF-Crime datasets. The code is available at

Result: 实验表明，该方法能显著提升文本对齐和目标分布保真度，且无需额外计算开销。

Conclusion: 提出的个性化引导方法有效解决了现有方法的局限性，实现了更好的平衡。

Abstract: Personalizing text-to-image diffusion models is crucial for adapting the
pre-trained models to specific target concepts, enabling diverse image
generation. However, fine-tuning with few images introduces an inherent
trade-off between aligning with the target distribution (e.g., subject
fidelity) and preserving the broad knowledge of the original model (e.g., text
editability). Existing sampling guidance methods, such as classifier-free
guidance (CFG) and autoguidance (AG), fail to effectively guide the output
toward well-balanced space: CFG restricts the adaptation to the target
distribution, while AG compromises text alignment. To address these
limitations, we propose personalization guidance, a simple yet effective method
leveraging an unlearned weak model conditioned on a null text prompt. Moreover,
our method dynamically controls the extent of unlearning in a weak model
through weight interpolation between pre-trained and fine-tuned models during
inference. Unlike existing guidance methods, which depend solely on guidance
scales, our method explicitly steers the outputs toward a balanced latent space
without additional computational overhead. Experimental results demonstrate
that our proposed guidance can improve text alignment and target distribution
fidelity, integrating seamlessly with various fine-tuning strategies.

Abstract: This paper introduces a practical and accurate calibration method for camera
spectral sensitivity using a diffraction grating. Accurate calibration of
camera spectral sensitivity is crucial for various computer vision tasks,
including color correction, illumination estimation, and material analysis.
Unlike existing approaches that require specialized narrow-band filters or
reference targets with known spectral reflectances, our method only requires an
uncalibrated diffraction grating sheet, readily available off-the-shelf. By

Result: 在18个数据集上验证，Claude 3.7在TQA、DocVQA和MMCoQA任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: 大型视觉语言模型在多图像推理中表现优异，提示设计对性能有显著影响。

Abstract: We present a Collaborative Agent-Based Framework for Multi-Image Reasoning.
Our approach tackles the challenge of interleaved multimodal reasoning across
diverse datasets and task formats by employing a dual-agent system: a
language-based PromptEngineer, which generates context-aware, task-specific
prompts, and a VisionReasoner, a large vision-language model (LVLM) responsible
for final inference. The framework is fully automated, modular, and
training-free, enabling generalization across classification, question
answering, and free-form generation tasks involving one or multiple input
images. We evaluate our method on 18 diverse datasets from the 2025 MIRAGE
Challenge (Track A), covering a broad spectrum of visual reasoning tasks
including document QA, visual comparison, dialogue-based understanding, and
scene-level inference. Our results demonstrate that LVLMs can effectively
reason over multiple images when guided by informative prompts. Notably, Claude
3.7 achieves near-ceiling performance on challenging tasks such as TQA (99.13%
accuracy), DocVQA (96.87%), and MMCoQA (75.28 ROUGE-L). We also explore how
design choices-such as model selection, shot count, and input length-influence
the reasoning performance of different LVLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于速度引导的可学习卡尔曼滤波器（SG-LKF），通过动态调整不确定性建模以适应车辆速度，显著提升了动态场景中的跟踪稳定性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多目标跟踪方法在高速动态场景中因忽视车辆速度引起的观测噪声和参考帧变化，导致跟踪性能下降。

Method: 提出SG-LKF，结合MotionScaleNet（MSNet）动态预测关键参数，并引入自监督轨迹一致性损失以增强帧间关联和轨迹连续性。

Result: 在KITTI 2D MOT上以79.59% HOTA排名第一，KITTI 3D MOT上达82.03% HOTA，nuScenes 3D MOT上优于SimpleTrack 2.2% AMOTA。

Conclusion: SG-LKF通过动态适应车辆速度，显著提升了多目标跟踪在动态场景中的性能。

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) enables autonomous vehicles to continuously
perceive dynamic objects, supplying essential temporal cues for prediction,
behavior understanding, and safe planning. However, conventional
tracking-by-detection methods typically rely on static coordinate
transformations based on ego-vehicle poses, disregarding ego-vehicle
speed-induced variations in observation noise and reference frame changes,
which degrades tracking stability and accuracy in dynamic, high-speed
scenarios. In this paper, we investigate the critical role of ego-vehicle speed
in MOT and propose a Speed-Guided Learnable Kalman Filter (SG-LKF) that
dynamically adapts uncertainty modeling to ego-vehicle speed, significantly
improving stability and accuracy in highly dynamic scenarios. Central to SG-LKF
is MotionScaleNet (MSNet), a decoupled token-mixing and channel-mixing MLP that
adaptively predicts key parameters of SG-LKF. To enhance inter-frame
association and trajectory continuity, we introduce a self-supervised
trajectory consistency loss jointly optimized with semantic and positional
constraints. Extensive experiments show that SG-LKF ranks first among all
vision-based methods on KITTI 2D MOT with 79.59% HOTA, delivers strong results
on KITTI 3D MOT with 82.03% HOTA, and outperforms SimpleTrack by 2.2% AMOTA on
nuScenes 3D MOT.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种高效的协作感知方法CoST，通过统一时空空间同时聚合多智能体和多时间观测，提高了特征传输效率和融合性能。

Motivation: 解决传统方法中多智能体和多时间融合分离导致的效率低下和性能不足问题。

Method: 提出统一时空空间的协作感知方法CoST，结合时空Transformer实现高效特征传输和融合。

Result: CoST在效率和准确性上均有提升，且兼容多数现有方法，降低传输带宽需求。

Conclusion: CoST为协作感知提供了一种高效且通用的解决方案，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Collaborative perception shares information among different agents and helps
solving problems that individual agents may face, e.g., occlusions and small
sensing range. Prior methods usually separate the multi-agent fusion and
multi-time fusion into two consecutive steps. In contrast, this paper proposes
an efficient collaborative perception that aggregates the observations from
different agents (space) and different times into a unified spatio-temporal
space simultanesouly. The unified spatio-temporal space brings two benefits,
i.e., efficient feature transmission and superior feature fusion. 1) Efficient
feature transmission: each static object yields a single observation in the
spatial temporal space, and thus only requires transmission only once (whereas
prior methods re-transmit all the object features multiple times). 2) superior
feature fusion: merging the multi-agent and multi-time fusion into a unified
spatial-temporal aggregation enables a more holistic perspective, thereby
enhancing perception performance in challenging scenarios. Consequently, our
Collaborative perception with Spatio-temporal Transformer (CoST) gains
improvement in both efficiency and accuracy. Notably, CoST is not tied to any
specific method and is compatible with a majority of previous methods,
enhancing their accuracy while reducing the transmission bandwidth.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于机器学习的蜂蜜植物来源自动分类方法，通过数据集准备、特征提取和分类三个步骤，使用LDA和SVM/KNN模型，在标准数据集上取得了95.13%和92.80%的高分类准确率。

Result: 在标准数据集上，分别实现了95.13%（图像分类）和92.80%（实例分类）的最高准确率。

Conclusion: 该方法在蜂蜜植物来源分类上表现优异，达到了先进水平。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a machine learning-based method for automatically
classifying honey botanical origins. Dataset preparation, feature extraction,
and classification are the three main steps of the proposed method. We use a
class transformation method in the dataset preparation phase to maximize the
separability across classes. The feature extraction phase employs the Linear
Discriminant Analysis (LDA) technique for extracting relevant features and
reducing the number of dimensions. In the classification phase, we use Support
Vector Machines (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) models to classify the
extracted features of honey samples into their botanical origins. We evaluate
our system using a standard honey hyperspectral imaging (HSI) dataset.
Experimental findings demonstrate that the proposed system produces
state-of-the-art results on this dataset, achieving the highest classification
accuracy of 95.13% for hyperspectral image-based classification and 92.80% for
hyperspectral instance-based classification.

TL;DR: SparseRecon提出了一种新的稀疏视图神经隐式重建方法，通过特征一致性和不确定性引导的深度约束提升重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有稀疏视图重建方法在未见视图上泛化能力差或重建质量受限，SparseRecon旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 结合体积渲染特征一致性损失和不确定性引导深度约束，优化神经隐式场。

Result: 实验表明SparseRecon优于现有方法，尤其在视图重叠较少的场景中表现突出。

Conclusion: SparseRecon通过特征一致性和深度约束显著提升了稀疏视图重建的完整性和细节质量。

Abstract: Surface reconstruction from sparse views aims to reconstruct a 3D shape or
scene from few RGB images. The latest methods are either generalization-based
or overfitting-based. However, the generalization-based methods do not
generalize well on views that were unseen during training, while the
reconstruction quality of overfitting-based methods is still limited by the
limited geometry clues. To address this issue, we propose SparseRecon, a novel
neural implicit reconstruction method for sparse views with volume
rendering-based feature consistency and uncertainty-guided depth constraint.
Firstly, we introduce a feature consistency loss across views to constrain the
neural implicit field. This design alleviates the ambiguity caused by
insufficient consistency information of views and ensures completeness and
smoothness in the reconstruction results. Secondly, we employ an
uncertainty-guided depth constraint to back up the feature consistency loss in
areas with occlusion and insignificant features, which recovers geometry
details for better reconstruction quality. Experimental results demonstrate
that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, which can produce
high-quality geometry with sparse-view input, especially in the scenarios with
small overlapping views. Project page: https://hanl2010.github.io/SparseRecon/.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Representation Shift的训练无关、模型无关的度量方法，用于衡量令牌表示的变化程度，从而与FlashAttention兼容地实现令牌压缩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着任务复杂度的增加，Transformer模型和令牌数量增多，导致自注意力的二次计算成本和GPU内存访问开销增加。现有令牌压缩方法依赖注意力图，与FlashAttention不兼容。

Method: 提出Representation Shift度量方法，无需训练或注意力图，直接测量令牌表示的变化程度，实现令牌压缩。

Result: 实验表明，该方法与FlashAttention兼容，在视频-文本检索和视频问答任务中分别实现了5.5%和4.4%的速度提升。

Conclusion: Representation Shift是一种高效、通用的令牌压缩方法，适用于多种模型，且无需额外训练。

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated remarkable success across vision, language,
and video. Yet, increasing task complexity has led to larger models and more
tokens, raising the quadratic cost of self-attention and the overhead of GPU
memory access. To reduce the computation cost of self-attention, prior work has
proposed token compression techniques that drop redundant or less informative
tokens. Meanwhile, fused attention kernels such as FlashAttention have been
developed to alleviate memory overhead by avoiding attention map construction
and its associated I/O to HBM. This, however, makes it incompatible with most
training-free token compression methods, which rely on attention maps to
determine token importance. Here, we propose Representation Shift, a
training-free, model-agnostic metric that measures the degree of change in each
token's representation. This seamlessly integrates token compression with
FlashAttention, without attention maps or retraining. Our method further
generalizes beyond Transformers to CNNs and state space models. Extensive
experiments show that Representation Shift enables effective token compression
compatible with FlashAttention, yielding significant speedups of up to 5.5% and
4.4% in video-text retrieval and video QA, respectively. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法因单向性限制性能，难以捕捉场景中语义不同的子动作。

Method: 结合前向和后向预测，使用大语言模型BiAnt。

Result: 在Ego4D上实验显示，BiAnt在编辑距离上优于基线方法。

Conclusion: BiAnt通过双向预测有效提升长期动作预测性能。

Abstract: Video-based long-term action anticipation is crucial for early risk detection
in areas such as automated driving and robotics. Conventional approaches
extract features from past actions using encoders and predict future events
with decoders, which limits performance due to their unidirectional nature.
These methods struggle to capture semantically distinct sub-actions within a
scene. The proposed method, BiAnt, addresses this limitation by combining
forward prediction with backward prediction using a large language model.
Experimental results on Ego4D demonstrate that BiAnt improves performance in
terms of edit distance compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: 该工作增强了焊接缺陷检测系统的可靠性、安全性和可解释性，适用于关键工业环境。

Abstract: Weld defect detection is crucial for ensuring the safety and reliability of
piping systems in the oil and gas industry, especially in challenging marine
and offshore environments. Traditional non-destructive testing (NDT) methods
often fail to detect subtle or internal defects, leading to potential failures
and costly downtime. Furthermore, existing neural network-based approaches for
defect classification frequently rely on arbitrarily selected pretrained
architectures and lack interpretability, raising safety concerns for
deployment. To address these challenges, this paper introduces
``Adapt-WeldNet", an adaptive framework for welding defect detection that
systematically evaluates various pre-trained architectures, transfer learning
strategies, and adaptive optimizers to identify the best-performing model and
hyperparameters, optimizing defect detection and providing actionable insights.
Additionally, a novel Defect Detection Interpretability Analysis (DDIA)
framework is proposed to enhance system transparency. DDIA employs Explainable
AI (XAI) techniques, such as Grad-CAM and LIME, alongside domain-specific
evaluations validated by certified ASNT NDE Level II professionals.
Incorporating a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) approach and aligning with the
principles of Trustworthy AI, DDIA ensures the reliability, fairness, and
accountability of the defect detection system, fostering confidence in
automated decisions through expert validation. By improving both performance
and interpretability, this work enhances trust, safety, and reliability in
welding defect detection systems, supporting critical operations in offshore
and marine environments.

Motivation: 空间转录组学成本高且技术复杂，限制了临床应用。从常规病理图像预测基因表达是一种替代方案，但现有ViT模型表现不佳。

Method: 提出$MV_{Hybrid}$架构，结合SSMs和ViT，并在相同数据集上与其他五种架构进行比较。

Result: $MV_{Hybrid}$在基因表达预测中表现优于ViT，相关性提高57%，性能下降减少43%。

Conclusion: $MV_{Hybrid}$在多项任务中表现优异，有望成为下一代病理学VFM的骨干架构。

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics reveals gene expression patterns within tissue
context, enabling precision oncology applications such as treatment response
prediction, but its high cost and technical complexity limit clinical adoption.
Predicting spatial gene expression (biomarkers) from routine histopathology
images offers a practical alternative, yet current vision foundation models
(VFMs) in pathology based on Vision Transformer (ViT) backbones perform below
clinical standards. Given that VFMs are already trained on millions of diverse
whole slide images, we hypothesize that architectural innovations beyond ViTs
may better capture the low-frequency, subtle morphological patterns correlating
with molecular phenotypes. By demonstrating that state space models initialized
with negative real eigenvalues exhibit strong low-frequency bias, we introduce
$MV_{Hybrid}$, a hybrid backbone architecture combining state space models
(SSMs) with ViT. We compare five other different backbone architectures for
pathology VFMs, all pretrained on identical colorectal cancer datasets using
the DINOv2 self-supervised learning method. We evaluate all pretrained models
using both random split and leave-one-study-out (LOSO) settings of the same
biomarker dataset. In LOSO evaluation, $MV_{Hybrid}$ achieves 57% higher
correlation than the best-performing ViT and shows 43% smaller performance
degradation compared to random split in gene expression prediction,
demonstrating superior performance and robustness, respectively. Furthermore,
$MV_{Hybrid}$ shows equal or better downstream performance in classification,
patch retrieval, and survival prediction tasks compared to that of ViT, showing
its promise as a next-generation pathology VFM backbone. Our code is publicly
available at: https://github.com/deepnoid-ai/MVHybrid.

Conclusion: Cued-Agent通过多智能体协作有效解决了CS识别中的多模态融合问题，为未来研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Cued Speech (CS) is a visual communication system that combines lip-reading
with hand coding to facilitate communication for individuals with hearing
impairments. Automatic CS Recognition (ACSR) aims to convert CS hand gestures
and lip movements into text via AI-driven methods. Traditionally, the temporal
asynchrony between hand and lip movements requires the design of complex
modules to facilitate effective multimodal fusion. However, constrained by
limited data availability, current methods demonstrate insufficient capacity
for adequately training these fusion mechanisms, resulting in suboptimal
performance. Recently, multi-agent systems have shown promising capabilities in
handling complex tasks with limited data availability. To this end, we propose
the first collaborative multi-agent system for ACSR, named Cued-Agent. It
integrates four specialized sub-agents: a Multimodal Large Language Model-based
Hand Recognition agent that employs keyframe screening and CS expert prompt
strategies to decode hand movements, a pretrained Transformer-based Lip
Recognition agent that extracts lip features from the input video, a Hand
Prompt Decoding agent that dynamically integrates hand prompts with lip
features during inference in a training-free manner, and a Self-Correction
Phoneme-to-Word agent that enables post-process and end-to-end conversion from
phoneme sequences to natural language sentences for the first time through
semantic refinement. To support this study, we expand the existing Mandarin CS
dataset by collecting data from eight hearing-impaired cuers, establishing a
mixed dataset of fourteen subjects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
Cued-Agent performs superbly in both normal and hearing-impaired scenarios
compared with state-of-the-art methods. The implementation is available at

Result: 在少样本学习、基础到新类泛化和数据高效学习中，DAPT在多个基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: DAPT通过解耦和对齐策略有效解决了信息不对称问题，提升了模型的性能。

Abstract: Prompt tuning (PT), as an emerging resource-efficient fine-tuning paradigm,
has showcased remarkable effectiveness in improving the task-specific
transferability of vision-language models. This paper delves into a previously
overlooked information asymmetry issue in PT, where the visual modality mostly
conveys more context than the object-oriented textual modality.
Correspondingly, coarsely aligning these two modalities could result in the
biased attention, driving the model to merely focus on the context area. To
address this, we propose DAPT, an effective PT framework based on an intuitive
decouple-before-align concept. First, we propose to explicitly decouple the
visual modality into the foreground and background representation via
exploiting coarse-and-fine visual segmenting cues, and then both of these
decoupled patterns are aligned with the original foreground texts and the
hand-crafted background classes, thereby symmetrically strengthening the modal
alignment. To further enhance the visual concentration, we propose a visual
pull-push regularization tailored for the foreground-background patterns,
directing the original visual representation towards unbiased attention on the
region-of-interest object. We demonstrate the power of architecture-free DAPT
through few-shot learning, base-to-novel generalization, and data-efficient
learning, all of which yield superior performance across prevailing benchmarks.
Our code will be released at https://github.com/Ferenas/DAPT.

Conclusion: 通过结合互补特征，该方法能有效检测多种伪造视频，解决了高保真AI视频的伪造检测难题。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of diffusion-based video generation models has led to
increasingly realistic synthetic content, presenting new challenges for video
forgery detection. Existing methods often struggle to capture fine-grained
temporal inconsistencies, particularly in AI-generated videos with high visual
fidelity and coherent motion. In this work, we propose a detection framework
that leverages spatial-temporal consistency by combining RGB appearance
features with optical flow residuals. The model adopts a dual-branch
architecture, where one branch analyzes RGB frames to detect appearance-level
artifacts, while the other processes flow residuals to reveal subtle motion
anomalies caused by imperfect temporal synthesis. By integrating these
complementary features, the proposed method effectively detects a wide range of
forged videos. Extensive experiments on text-to-video and image-to-video tasks
across ten diverse generative models demonstrate the robustness and strong
generalization ability of the proposed approach.

Result: 现有模型在iSafetyBench上表现不佳，尤其是在识别危险活动和多标签场景中。

Conclusion: 需要更鲁棒、安全感知的多模态模型，iSafetyBench为这一方向提供了首个测试平台。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled impressive
generalization across diverse video understanding tasks under zero-shot
settings. However, their capabilities in high-stakes industrial domains-where
recognizing both routine operations and safety-critical anomalies is
essential-remain largely underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce
iSafetyBench, a new video-language benchmark specifically designed to evaluate
model performance in industrial environments across both normal and hazardous
scenarios. iSafetyBench comprises 1,100 video clips sourced from real-world
industrial settings, annotated with open-vocabulary, multi-label action tags
spanning 98 routine and 67 hazardous action categories. Each clip is paired
with multiple-choice questions for both single-label and multi-label
evaluation, enabling fine-grained assessment of VLMs in both standard and
safety-critical contexts. We evaluate eight state-of-the-art video-language
models under zero-shot conditions. Despite their strong performance on existing
video benchmarks, these models struggle with iSafetyBench-particularly in
recognizing hazardous activities and in multi-label scenarios. Our results
reveal significant performance gaps, underscoring the need for more robust,
safety-aware multimodal models for industrial applications. iSafetyBench
provides a first-of-its-kind testbed to drive progress in this direction. The

Abstract: Geometric distortions and blurring caused by atmospheric turbulence degrade
the quality of long-range dynamic scene videos. Existing methods struggle with
restoring edge details and eliminating mixed distortions, especially under
conditions of strong turbulence and complex dynamics. To address these
challenges, we introduce a Dynamic Efficiency Index ($DEI$), which combines
turbulence intensity, optical flow, and proportions of dynamic regions to
accurately quantify video dynamic intensity under varying turbulence conditions
and provide a high-dynamic turbulence training dataset. Additionally, we
propose a Physical Model-Driven Multi-Stage Video Restoration ($PMR$) framework
that consists of three stages: \textbf{de-tilting} for geometric stabilization,
\textbf{motion segmentation enhancement} for dynamic region refinement, and
\textbf{de-blurring} for quality restoration. $PMR$ employs lightweight
backbones and stage-wise joint training to ensure both efficiency and high
restoration quality. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method
effectively suppresses motion trailing artifacts, restores edge details and
exhibits strong generalization capability, especially in real-world scenarios
characterized by high-turbulence and complex dynamics. We will make the code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DiTs的序列去噪过程导致高推理延迟，现有加速方法忽略了去噪阶段和Transformer块的语义变化。

Method: 提出Sortblock框架，动态缓存特征并基于残差演化排序，选择性跳过冗余计算，结合线性预测减少误差。

Result: 实验表明，Sortblock实现超过2倍的推理加速，且输出质量几乎无损。

Conclusion: Sortblock为扩散生成模型提供了一种高效通用的加速解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated remarkable generative
capabilities, particularly benefiting from Transformer architectures that
enhance visual and artistic fidelity. However, their inherently sequential
denoising process results in high inference latency, limiting their deployment
in real-time scenarios. Existing training-free acceleration approaches
typically reuse intermediate features at fixed timesteps or layers, overlooking
the evolving semantic focus across denoising stages and Transformer blocks.To
address this, we propose Sortblock, a training-free inference acceleration
framework that dynamically caches block-wise features based on their similarity
across adjacent timesteps. By ranking the evolution of residuals, Sortblock
adaptively determines a recomputation ratio, selectively skipping redundant
computations while preserving generation quality. Furthermore, we incorporate a
lightweight linear prediction mechanism to reduce accumulated errors in skipped
blocks.Extensive experiments across various tasks and DiT architectures
demonstrate that Sortblock achieves over 2$\times$ inference speedup with
minimal degradation in output quality, offering an effective and generalizable
solution for accelerating diffusion-based generative models.

*Junyu Chen,Dongyun Zou,Wenkun He,Junsong Chen,Enze Xie,Song Han,Han Cai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DC-AE 1.5是一种新型深度压缩自编码器，通过结构化潜在空间和增强扩散训练，解决了高分辨率扩散模型中潜在通道增加导致的收敛慢和生成质量下降问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 潜在通道数增加虽能提升重建质量，但会导致扩散模型收敛慢，限制生成质量上限，阻碍高空间压缩比自编码器的应用。

Method: 提出结构化潜在空间（训练时对潜在空间施加通道结构）和增强扩散训练（在对象潜在通道上增加扩散训练目标）。

Result: DC-AE 1.5在ImageNet 512x512上比DC-AE-f32c32生成质量更好且快4倍。

Conclusion: DC-AE 1.5通过创新方法解决了潜在通道增加带来的问题，显著提升了扩散模型的性能和效率。

Abstract: We present DC-AE 1.5, a new family of deep compression autoencoders for
high-resolution diffusion models. Increasing the autoencoder's latent channel
number is a highly effective approach for improving its reconstruction quality.
However, it results in slow convergence for diffusion models, leading to poorer
generation quality despite better reconstruction quality. This issue limits the
quality upper bound of latent diffusion models and hinders the employment of
autoencoders with higher spatial compression ratios. We introduce two key
innovations to address this challenge: i) Structured Latent Space, a
training-based approach to impose a desired channel-wise structure on the
latent space with front latent channels capturing object structures and latter
latent channels capturing image details; ii) Augmented Diffusion Training, an
augmented diffusion training strategy with additional diffusion training
objectives on object latent channels to accelerate convergence. With these
techniques, DC-AE 1.5 delivers faster convergence and better diffusion scaling
results than DC-AE. On ImageNet 512x512, DC-AE-1.5-f64c128 delivers better
image generation quality than DC-AE-f32c32 while being 4x faster. Code:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于视频修复模型的视频外绘方法，通过改进判别器设计和损失函数，显著提升了外绘效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频外绘方法主要关注背景生成，而忽略了对象流动和重建的一致性，导致效果不佳。

Method: 采用分层判别器设计，区分全局和局部对抗训练目标，并开发了专门的外绘损失函数。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在定量和定性上均优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 通过改进判别器和损失函数，实现了更高质量的视频外绘效果。

Abstract: Video outpainting presents a unique challenge of extending the borders while
maintaining consistency with the given content. In this paper, we suggest the
use of video inpainting models that excel in object flow learning and
reconstruction in outpainting rather than solely generating the background as
in existing methods. However, directly applying or fine-tuning inpainting
models to outpainting has shown to be ineffective, often leading to blurry
results. Our extensive experiments on discriminator designs reveal that a
critical component missing in the outpainting fine-tuning process is a
discriminator capable of effectively assessing the perceptual quality of the
extended areas. To tackle this limitation, we differentiate the objectives of
adversarial training into global and local goals and introduce a hierarchical
discriminator that meets both objectives. Additionally, we develop a
specialized outpainting loss function that leverages both local and global
features of the discriminator. Fine-tuning on this adversarial loss function
enhances the generator's ability to produce both visually appealing and
globally coherent outpainted scenes. Our proposed method outperforms
state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and qualitatively. Supplementary
materials including the demo video and the code are available in SigPort.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Mamba的水下实例分割模型UIS-Mamba，通过动态树扫描和隐藏状态削弱模块解决水下场景的挑战，取得了优异的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下实例分割任务因水下场景的特殊性（如颜色失真和模糊边界）面临挑战，现有固定补丁扫描机制无法保持实例连续性，复杂背景也会干扰实例理解。

Method: 设计了动态树扫描（DTS）模块和隐藏状态削弱（HSW）模块，前者通过动态偏移和缩放保持实例连续性，后者通过Ncut机制抑制背景干扰。

Result: 在UIIS和USIS10K数据集上实现了最先进的性能，同时保持了低参数和计算复杂度。

Conclusion: UIS-Mamba成功将Mamba迁移至水下任务，为解决水下实例分割问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Underwater Instance Segmentation (UIS) tasks are crucial for underwater
complex scene detection. Mamba, as an emerging state space model with
inherently linear complexity and global receptive fields, is highly suitable
for processing image segmentation tasks with long sequence features. However,
due to the particularity of underwater scenes, there are many challenges in
applying Mamba to UIS. The existing fixed-patch scanning mechanism cannot
maintain the internal continuity of scanned instances in the presence of
severely underwater color distortion and blurred instance boundaries, and the
hidden state of the complex underwater background can also inhibit the
understanding of instance objects. In this work, we propose the first
Mamba-based underwater instance segmentation model UIS-Mamba, and design two
innovative modules, Dynamic Tree Scan (DTS) and Hidden State Weaken (HSW), to
migrate Mamba to the underwater task. DTS module maintains the continuity of
the internal features of the instance objects by allowing the patches to
dynamically offset and scale, thereby guiding the minimum spanning tree and
providing dynamic local receptive fields. HSW module suppresses the
interference of complex backgrounds and effectively focuses the information
flow of state propagation to the instances themselves through the Ncut-based
hidden state weakening mechanism. Experimental results show that UIS-Mamba
achieves state-of-the-art performance on both UIIS and USIS10K datasets, while
maintaining a low number of parameters and computational complexity. Code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合物理先验知识和多区域修复技术的新方法，用于动态场景中的人-物交互（HOI）遮挡补全，显著提升了生成结果的准确性和真实性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如预训练扩散模型）在动态HOI场景中难以生成合理的遮挡补全，因其对HOI的理解有限。

Method: 利用人类拓扑和接触信息的物理约束，定义主次区域，并在扩散模型中采用定制化的去噪策略进行多区域修复。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在HOI场景中显著优于现有方法，且无需真实接触标注仍具鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法使机器感知更接近人类对动态环境的理解，适用于3D重建和新视角/姿态合成等任务。

Abstract: Amodal completion, which is the process of inferring the full appearance of
objects despite partial occlusions, is crucial for understanding complex
human-object interactions (HOI) in computer vision and robotics. Existing
methods, such as those that use pre-trained diffusion models, often struggle to
generate plausible completions in dynamic scenarios because they have a limited
understanding of HOI. To solve this problem, we've developed a new approach
that uses physical prior knowledge along with a specialized multi-regional
inpainting technique designed for HOI. By incorporating physical constraints
from human topology and contact information, we define two distinct regions:
the primary region, where occluded object parts are most likely to be, and the
secondary region, where occlusions are less probable. Our multi-regional
inpainting method uses customized denoising strategies across these regions
within a diffusion model. This improves the accuracy and realism of the
generated completions in both their shape and visual detail. Our experimental
results show that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods in
HOI scenarios, moving machine perception closer to a more human-like
understanding of dynamic environments. We also show that our pipeline is robust
even without ground-truth contact annotations, which broadens its applicability
to tasks like 3D reconstruction and novel view/pose synthesis.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对管状结构分割（TSS）的测试时适应框架TopoTTA，通过拓扑增强方法解决领域偏移问题，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 管状结构分割对领域偏移非常敏感，传统方法在未见目标域中性能下降明显，因此需要一种专门的方法来保持拓扑结构的完整性。

Method: TopoTTA分为两阶段：1）使用TopoMDCs适应跨域拓扑差异；2）通过TopoHG生成伪标签并优化拓扑连续性。

Result: 在四个场景和十个数据集上的实验表明，TopoTTA平均提升了31.81%的clDice指标。

Conclusion: TopoTTA是一种有效的、即插即用的解决方案，适用于基于CNN的TSS模型。

Abstract: Tubular structure segmentation (TSS) is important for various applications,
such as hemodynamic analysis and route navigation. Despite significant progress
in TSS, domain shifts remain a major challenge, leading to performance
degradation in unseen target domains. Unlike other segmentation tasks, TSS is
more sensitive to domain shifts, as changes in topological structures can
compromise segmentation integrity, and variations in local features
distinguishing foreground from background (e.g., texture and contrast) may
further disrupt topological continuity. To address these challenges, we propose
Topology-enhanced Test-Time Adaptation (TopoTTA), the first test-time
adaptation framework designed specifically for TSS. TopoTTA consists of two
stages: Stage 1 adapts models to cross-domain topological discrepancies using
the proposed Topological Meta Difference Convolutions (TopoMDCs), which enhance
topological representation without altering pre-trained parameters; Stage 2
improves topological continuity by a novel Topology Hard sample Generation
(TopoHG) strategy and prediction alignment on hard samples with pseudo-labels
in the generated pseudo-break regions. Extensive experiments across four
scenarios and ten datasets demonstrate TopoTTA's effectiveness in handling
topological distribution shifts, achieving an average improvement of 31.81% in
clDice. TopoTTA also serves as a plug-and-play TTA solution for CNN-based TSS
models.

TL;DR: SDMatte是一种基于扩散模型的交互式抠图方法，通过视觉提示和注意力机制提升边缘细节的提取能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有交互式抠图方法在提取边缘细节上表现不足，扩散模型因其强大的数据建模和纹理合成能力成为潜在解决方案。

Method: 利用扩散模型的先验知识，将文本驱动能力转化为视觉提示驱动；结合坐标嵌入和透明度嵌入；提出掩码自注意力机制。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验验证了SDMatte在交互式抠图中的优越性能。

Conclusion: SDMatte通过扩散模型和视觉提示驱动，显著提升了交互式抠图的细节提取能力。

Abstract: Recent interactive matting methods have shown satisfactory performance in
capturing the primary regions of objects, but they fall short in extracting
fine-grained details in edge regions. Diffusion models trained on billions of
image-text pairs, demonstrate exceptional capability in modeling highly complex
data distributions and synthesizing realistic texture details, while exhibiting
robust text-driven interaction capabilities, making them an attractive solution
for interactive matting. To this end, we propose SDMatte, a diffusion-driven
interactive matting model, with three key contributions. First, we exploit the
powerful priors of diffusion models and transform the text-driven interaction
capability into visual prompt-driven interaction capability to enable
interactive matting. Second, we integrate coordinate embeddings of visual
prompts and opacity embeddings of target objects into U-Net, enhancing
SDMatte's sensitivity to spatial position information and opacity information.
Third, we propose a masked self-attention mechanism that enables the model to
focus on areas specified by visual prompts, leading to better performance.
Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the superior performance
of our method, validating its effectiveness in interactive matting. Our code
and model are available at https://github.com/vivoCameraResearch/SDMatte.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AutoDebias是一个自动识别并减轻文本到图像（T2I）模型中社会偏见的框架，无需预先了解具体偏见类型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: T2I模型在生成高质量图像时常常表现出未提及的社会偏见，现有方法难以处理复杂或重叠的偏见。

Method: AutoDebias利用视觉语言模型检测偏见模式，并通过生成包容性替代提示构建公平指南，驱动CLIP引导的训练过程。

Result: 在覆盖25种以上偏见场景的基准测试中，AutoDebias检测有害模式的准确率达91.6%，将偏见输出从90%降至可忽略水平。

Conclusion: AutoDebias能有效处理复杂偏见，同时保持图像质量和多样性。

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) models generate high-quality images from text prompts but
often exhibit unintended social biases, such as gender or racial stereotypes,
even when these attributes are not mentioned. Existing debiasing methods work
well for simple or well-known cases but struggle with subtle or overlapping
biases. We propose AutoDebias, a framework that automatically identifies and
mitigates harmful biases in T2I models without prior knowledge of specific bias
types. Specifically, AutoDebias leverages vision-language models to detect
biased visual patterns and constructs fairness guides by generating inclusive
alternative prompts that reflect balanced representations. These guides drive a
CLIP-guided training process that promotes fairer outputs while preserving the
original model's image quality and diversity. Unlike existing methods,
AutoDebias effectively addresses both subtle stereotypes and multiple
interacting biases. We evaluate the framework on a benchmark covering over 25
bias scenarios, including challenging cases where multiple biases occur
simultaneously. AutoDebias detects harmful patterns with 91.6% accuracy and
reduces biased outputs from 90% to negligible levels, while preserving the
visual fidelity of the original model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解生物生长的时间动态对多个领域至关重要，但现有视觉语言模型在捕捉时间进展方面有限。

Result: 实验表明，CLIPTime能有效建模生物进展，并生成可解释的时间相关输出。

Conclusion: CLIPTime展示了视觉语言模型在生物监测应用中的潜力。

Abstract: Understanding the temporal dynamics of biological growth is critical across
diverse fields such as microbiology, agriculture, and biodegradation research.
Although vision-language models like Contrastive Language Image Pretraining
(CLIP) have shown strong capabilities in joint visual-textual reasoning, their
effectiveness in capturing temporal progression remains limited. To address
this, we propose CLIPTime, a multimodal, multitask framework designed to
predict both the developmental stage and the corresponding timestamp of fungal
growth from image and text inputs. Built upon the CLIP architecture, our model
learns joint visual-textual embeddings and enables time-aware inference without
requiring explicit temporal input during testing. To facilitate training and
evaluation, we introduce a synthetic fungal growth dataset annotated with
aligned timestamps and categorical stage labels. CLIPTime jointly performs
classification and regression, predicting discrete growth stages alongside
continuous timestamps. We also propose custom evaluation metrics, including
temporal accuracy and regression error, to assess the precision of time-aware
predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that CLIPTime effectively models
biological progression and produces interpretable, temporally grounded outputs,
highlighting the potential of vision-language models in real-world biological
monitoring applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多光谱和高光谱图像融合任务因光谱与空间信息的固有权衡和数据对齐问题而具有不适定性，现有方法未能有效解决。

Method: PIF-Net采用可逆Mamba架构保持信息一致性，并设计Fusion-Aware Low-Rank Adaptation模块动态校准特征。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，PIF-Net的图像恢复性能显著优于当前最优方法，同时保持模型高效。

Conclusion: PIF-Net通过结合不适定先验和轻量级设计，有效解决了多光谱和高光谱图像融合的挑战。

Abstract: The goal of multispectral and hyperspectral image fusion (MHIF) is to
generate high-quality images that simultaneously possess rich spectral
information and fine spatial details. However, due to the inherent trade-off
between spectral and spatial information and the limited availability of
observations, this task is fundamentally ill-posed. Previous studies have not
effectively addressed the ill-posed nature caused by data misalignment. To
tackle this challenge, we propose a fusion framework named PIF-Net, which
explicitly incorporates ill-posed priors to effectively fuse multispectral
images and hyperspectral images. To balance global spectral modeling with
computational efficiency, we design a method based on an invertible Mamba
architecture that maintains information consistency during feature
transformation and fusion, ensuring stable gradient flow and process
reversibility. Furthermore, we introduce a novel fusion module called the
Fusion-Aware Low-Rank Adaptation module, which dynamically calibrates spectral
and spatial features while keeping the model lightweight. Extensive experiments
on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that PIF-Net achieves significantly
better image restoration performance than current state-of-the-art methods
while maintaining model efficiency.

Conclusion: SeTe-VSR有效解决了复杂视频超分辨率任务中的挑战。

Abstract: Recent advancements in video super-resolution (VSR) models have demonstrated
impressive results in enhancing low-resolution videos. However, due to
limitations in adequately controlling the generation process, achieving high
fidelity alignment with the low-resolution input while maintaining temporal
consistency across frames remains a significant challenge. In this work, we
propose Semantic and Temporal Guided Video Super-Resolution (SeTe-VSR), a novel
approach that incorporates both semantic and temporal-spatio guidance in the
latent diffusion space to address these challenges. By incorporating high-level
semantic information and integrating spatial and temporal information, our
approach achieves a seamless balance between recovering intricate details and
ensuring temporal coherence. Our method not only preserves high-reality visual
content but also significantly enhances fidelity. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that SeTe-VSR outperforms existing methods in terms of detail
recovery and perceptual quality, highlighting its effectiveness for complex

Conclusion: HyPCV-Former在双曲空间中直接进行特征变换和异常评分，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Video anomaly detection is a fundamental task in video surveillance, with
broad applications in public safety and intelligent monitoring systems.
Although previous methods leverage Euclidean representations in RGB or depth
domains, such embeddings are inherently limited in capturing hierarchical event
structures and spatio-temporal continuity. To address these limitations, we
propose HyPCV-Former, a novel hyperbolic spatio-temporal transformer for
anomaly detection in 3D point cloud videos. Our approach first extracts
per-frame spatial features from point cloud sequences via point cloud
extractor, and then embeds them into Lorentzian hyperbolic space, which better
captures the latent hierarchical structure of events. To model temporal
dynamics, we introduce a hyperbolic multi-head self-attention (HMHA) mechanism
that leverages Lorentzian inner products and curvature-aware softmax to learn
temporal dependencies under non-Euclidean geometry. Our method performs all
feature transformations and anomaly scoring directly within full Lorentzian
space rather than via tangent space approximation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that HyPCV-Former achieves state-of-the-art performance across
multiple anomaly categories, with a 7\% improvement on the TIMo dataset and a
5.6\% gain on the DAD dataset compared to benchmarks. The code will be released
upon paper acceptance.

Conclusion: LAMIC为可控多图像合成提供了一种新的无需训练的方法，并有望随基础模型的进步而提升性能。

Abstract: In controllable image synthesis, generating coherent and consistent images
from multiple references with spatial layout awareness remains an open
challenge. We present LAMIC, a Layout-Aware Multi-Image Composition framework
that, for the first time, extends single-reference diffusion models to
multi-reference scenarios in a training-free manner. Built upon the MMDiT
model, LAMIC introduces two plug-and-play attention mechanisms: 1) Group
Isolation Attention (GIA) to enhance entity disentanglement; and 2)
Region-Modulated Attention (RMA) to enable layout-aware generation. To
comprehensively evaluate model capabilities, we further introduce three
metrics: 1) Inclusion Ratio (IN-R) and Fill Ratio (FI-R) for assessing layout
control; and 2) Background Similarity (BG-S) for measuring background
consistency. Extensive experiments show that LAMIC achieves state-of-the-art
performance across most major metrics: it consistently outperforms existing
multi-reference baselines in ID-S, BG-S, IN-R and AVG scores across all
settings, and achieves the best DPG in complex composition tasks. These results
demonstrate LAMIC's superior abilities in identity keeping, background
preservation, layout control, and prompt-following, all achieved without any
training or fine-tuning, showcasing strong zero-shot generalization ability. By
inheriting the strengths of advanced single-reference models and enabling
seamless extension to multi-image scenarios, LAMIC establishes a new
training-free paradigm for controllable multi-image composition. As foundation
models continue to evolve, LAMIC's performance is expected to scale
accordingly. Our implementation is available at:

<details>

Motivation: 在乳腺癌DCE-MRI中，小病灶的准确分割对早期癌症检测至关重要，但现有深度学习方法主要关注大病灶，忽略了纵向和临床信息。

Method: 提出Temporal Prior Attention (TPA)块动态整合历史与当前扫描信息，以及BI-RADS Consistency Regularization (BCR)损失函数，将领域知识嵌入训练过程。

Result: 在内部纵向数据集上，Dice分数比现有单时间点和纵向基线方法高出5%。

Conclusion: 结果表明，结合时间和临床背景对乳腺癌筛查中的早期病灶分割至关重要。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of small lesions in Breast Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced
MRI (DCE-MRI) is critical for early cancer detection, especially in high-risk
patients. While recent deep learning methods have advanced lesion segmentation,
they primarily target large lesions and neglect valuable longitudinal and
clinical information routinely used by radiologists. In real-world screening,
detecting subtle or emerging lesions requires radiologists to compare across
timepoints and consider previous radiology assessments, such as the BI-RADS
score. We propose LesiOnTime, a novel 3D segmentation approach that mimics
clinical diagnostic workflows by jointly leveraging longitudinal imaging and
BIRADS scores. The key components are: (1) a Temporal Prior Attention (TPA)
block that dynamically integrates information from previous and current scans;
and (2) a BI-RADS Consistency Regularization (BCR) loss that enforces latent
space alignment for scans with similar radiological assessments, thus embedding
domain knowledge into the training process. Evaluated on a curated in-house
longitudinal dataset of high-risk patients with DCE-MRI, our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art single-timepoint and longitudinal baselines by 5%
in terms of Dice. Ablation studies demonstrate that both TPA and BCR contribute
complementary performance gains. These results highlight the importance of
incorporating temporal and clinical context for reliable early lesion
segmentation in real-world breast cancer screening. Our code is publicly

### [60] [Leveraging Convolutional and Graph Networks for an Unsupervised Remote Sensing Labelling Tool](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00506)
*Tulsi Patel,Mark W. Jones,Thomas Redfern*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无监督的遥感影像标注方法，结合卷积和图神经网络，通过分割和特征编码实现更鲁棒的图像标注。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 遥感影像标注通常依赖专家分析且成本高，现有方法需要预标注数据。本文旨在开发一种无监督的标注工具。

Method: 使用卷积和图神经网络对Sentinel-2影像进行分割和特征编码，通过颜色和空间相似性分组像素，并利用图神经网络聚合局部信息。

Result: 减少了标注中的异常值，支持细粒度标注，并在编码空间中形成旋转不变的语义关系。

Conclusion: 该方法无需预标注数据，提供了一种更高效且鲁棒的遥感影像标注解决方案。

Abstract: Machine learning for remote sensing imaging relies on up-to-date and accurate
labels for model training and testing. Labelling remote sensing imagery is time
and cost intensive, requiring expert analysis. Previous labelling tools rely on
pre-labelled data for training in order to label new unseen data. In this work,
we define an unsupervised pipeline for finding and labelling geographical areas
of similar context and content within Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. Our
approach removes limitations of previous methods by utilising segmentation with
convolutional and graph neural networks to encode a more robust feature space
for image comparison. Unlike previous approaches we segment the image into
homogeneous regions of pixels that are grouped based on colour and spatial
similarity. Graph neural networks are used to aggregate information about the
surrounding segments enabling the feature representation to encode the local
neighbourhood whilst preserving its own local information. This reduces
outliers in the labelling tool, allows users to label at a granular level, and
allows a rotationally invariant semantic relationship at the image level to be
formed within the encoding space.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出EgoMask，首个用于自我中心视频细粒度时空定位的像素级基准，通过自动标注管道构建，并展示了现有模型在该基准上的表现不佳，但通过微调可显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自我中心视频在增强现实和机器人等应用中日益重要，但现有研究多集中于外中心视频，自我中心视频的时空定位仍未被充分探索。

Method: 提出EgoMask基准和自动标注管道，构建EgoMask-Train训练数据集，并分析自我中心视频与外中心视频的关键差异。

Result: 实验表明，现有模型在EgoMask上表现不佳，但通过微调EgoMask-Train可显著提升性能，同时不影响外中心数据集的表现。

Conclusion: EgoMask为自我中心视频理解提供了关键资源和见解，推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: Spatiotemporal video grounding aims to localize target entities in videos
based on textual queries. While existing research has made significant progress
in exocentric videos, the egocentric setting remains relatively underexplored,
despite its growing importance in applications such as augmented reality and
robotics. In this work, we conduct a systematic analysis of the discrepancies
between egocentric and exocentric videos, revealing key challenges such as
shorter object durations, sparser trajectories, smaller object sizes, and
larger positional shifts. To address these challenges, we introduce EgoMask,
the first pixel-level benchmark for fine-grained spatiotemporal grounding in
egocentric videos. It is constructed by our proposed automatic annotation
pipeline, which annotates referring expressions and object masks across short-,
medium-, and long-term videos. Additionally, we create EgoMask-Train, a
large-scale training dataset to facilitate model development. Experiments
demonstrate that the state-of-the-art spatiotemporal grounding models perform
poorly on our benchmark EgoMask, but fine-tuning on EgoMask-Train yields
significant improvements, while preserving performance on exocentric datasets.
Our work thus provides essential resources and insights for advancing
egocentric video understanding. Our code is available at

### [62] [EPANet: Efficient Path Aggregation Network for Underwater Fish Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00528)
*Jinsong Yang,Zeyuan Hu,Yichen Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EPANet是一种高效的水下鱼类检测网络，通过互补特征集成实现轻量化和高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下鱼类检测因低分辨率、背景干扰和目标相似性而具有挑战性，现有方法常导致模型复杂且效率低。

Method: EPANet包含EPA-FPN（高效路径聚合特征金字塔网络）和MS-DDSP瓶颈（多尺度多样化短路径瓶颈），前者通过跨尺度连接增强特征互补性，后者通过细粒度特征划分提升多样性。

Result: 在基准数据集上，EPANet在检测精度和推理速度上优于现有方法，同时保持低参数量。

Conclusion: EPANet为水下鱼类检测提供了一种高效且轻量化的解决方案。

Abstract: Underwater fish detection (UFD) remains a challenging task in computer vision
due to low object resolution, significant background interference, and high
visual similarity between targets and surroundings. Existing approaches
primarily focus on local feature enhancement or incorporate complex attention
mechanisms to highlight small objects, often at the cost of increased model
complexity and reduced efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose an
efficient path aggregation network (EPANet), which leverages complementary
feature integration to achieve accurate and lightweight UFD. EPANet consists of
two key components: an efficient path aggregation feature pyramid network
(EPA-FPN) and a multi-scale diverse-division short path bottleneck (MS-DDSP
bottleneck). The EPA-FPN introduces long-range skip connections across
disparate scales to improve semantic-spatial complementarity, while cross-layer
fusion paths are adopted to enhance feature integration efficiency. The MS-DDSP
bottleneck extends the conventional bottleneck structure by introducing
finer-grained feature division and diverse convolutional operations, thereby
increasing local feature diversity and representation capacity. Extensive
experiments on benchmark UFD datasets demonstrate that EPANet outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in terms of detection accuracy and inference speed,
while maintaining comparable or even lower parameter complexity.

### [63] [Video Color Grading via Look-Up Table Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00548)
*Seunghyun Shin,Dongmin Shin,Jisu Shin,Hae-Gon Jeon,Joon-Young Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于参考的视频色彩分级框架，通过扩散模型生成查找表（LUT）实现色彩属性对齐，并结合用户偏好进行低级特征增强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频色彩分级通常需要专业技能，本文旨在简化这一过程，使其更易用且高效。

Method: 使用扩散模型生成LUT，对齐参考场景与输入视频的色彩属性，并通过文本提示结合用户偏好。

Result: 实验和用户研究表明，该方法能有效实现视频色彩分级，且不损失结构细节。

Conclusion: 提出的框架在视频色彩分级中表现出色，代码已开源。

Abstract: Different from color correction and transfer, color grading involves
adjusting colors for artistic or storytelling purposes in a video, which is
used to establish a specific look or mood. However, due to the complexity of
the process and the need for specialized editing skills, video color grading
remains primarily the domain of professional colorists. In this paper, we
present a reference-based video color grading framework. Our key idea is
explicitly generating a look-up table (LUT) for color attribute alignment
between reference scenes and input video via a diffusion model. As a training
objective, we enforce that high-level features of the reference scenes like
look, mood, and emotion should be similar to that of the input video. Our
LUT-based approach allows for color grading without any loss of structural
details in the whole video frames as well as achieving fast inference. We
further build a pipeline to incorporate a user-preference via text prompts for
low-level feature enhancement such as contrast and brightness, etc.
Experimental results, including extensive user studies, demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach for video color grading. Codes are publicly
available at https://github.com/seunghyuns98/VideoColorGrading.

*Daniel Wolf,Heiko Hillenhagen,Billurvan Taskin,Alex Bäuerle,Meinrad Beer,Michael Götz,Timo Ropinski*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文评估了视觉语言模型（VLMs）在医学图像中判断相对位置的能力，发现现有模型表现不佳，并提出视觉提示和基准数据集MIRP以促进研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床决策依赖于解剖结构和异常的相对位置，但VLMs在此任务上的能力尚未充分探索。

Method: 评估了GPT-4o、Llama3.2等先进VLMs，并尝试使用视觉提示（如标记）提升性能。

Result: 模型表现不佳，依赖先验知识而非图像内容，视觉提示仅带来有限改进。

Conclusion: 提出MIRP基准数据集，以系统性评估医学图像中的相对位置识别能力。

Abstract: Clinical decision-making relies heavily on understanding relative positions
of anatomical structures and anomalies. Therefore, for Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) to be applicable in clinical practice, the ability to accurately
determine relative positions on medical images is a fundamental prerequisite.
Despite its importance, this capability remains highly underexplored. To
address this gap, we evaluate the ability of state-of-the-art VLMs, GPT-4o,
Llama3.2, Pixtral, and JanusPro, and find that all models fail at this
fundamental task. Inspired by successful approaches in computer vision, we
investigate whether visual prompts, such as alphanumeric or colored markers
placed on anatomical structures, can enhance performance. While these markers
provide moderate improvements, results remain significantly lower on medical
images compared to observations made on natural images. Our evaluations suggest
that, in medical imaging, VLMs rely more on prior anatomical knowledge than on
actual image content for answering relative position questions, often leading
to incorrect conclusions. To facilitate further research in this area, we
introduce the MIRP , Medical Imaging Relative Positioning, benchmark dataset,
designed to systematically evaluate the capability to identify relative
positions in medical images.

*Chihan Huang,Belal Alsinglawi,Islam Al-qudah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种高效的对抗净化框架DBLP，通过噪声桥蒸馏和自适应语义增强，显著提升了鲁棒性和图像质量，推理时间仅需0.2秒。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络易受对抗扰动攻击，现有扩散净化方法因迭代去噪效率低而难以实际应用。

Method: 采用噪声桥蒸馏目标，在潜在一致性模型中构建对抗噪声与干净数据的分布对齐，并结合多尺度金字塔边缘图进行自适应语义增强。

Result: 在多个数据集上达到SOTA鲁棒精度和图像质量，推理时间约0.2秒。

Conclusion: DBLP为实时对抗净化提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep neural networks (DNNs) have led to remarkable success
across a wide range of tasks. However, their susceptibility to adversarial
perturbations remains a critical vulnerability. Existing diffusion-based
adversarial purification methods often require intensive iterative denoising,
severely limiting their practical deployment. In this paper, we propose
Diffusion Bridge Distillation for Purification (DBLP), a novel and efficient
diffusion-based framework for adversarial purification. Central to our approach
is a new objective, noise bridge distillation, which constructs a principled
alignment between the adversarial noise distribution and the clean data
distribution within a latent consistency model (LCM). To further enhance
semantic fidelity, we introduce adaptive semantic enhancement, which fuses
multi-scale pyramid edge maps as conditioning input to guide the purification
process. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that DBLP
achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) robust accuracy, superior image quality, and
around 0.2s inference time, marking a significant step toward real-time
adversarial purification.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HiPrune是一种无需训练、模型无关的视觉令牌剪枝框架，利用视觉编码器的分层注意力结构，显著提升推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉语言模型中视觉令牌序列过长导致的计算开销大和推理效率低的问题。

Method: 基于分层注意力结构选择三类信息令牌：锚定令牌、缓冲令牌和注册令牌，无需重新训练。

Result: 在多个模型上实现最优剪枝性能，保留99.3%任务准确率仅需33.3%令牌，减少9倍FLOPs和延迟。

Conclusion: HiPrune是一种高效、通用的视觉令牌剪枝方法，适用于多种模型和任务。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) encode images into lengthy sequences of visual
tokens, leading to excessive computational overhead and limited inference
efficiency. While prior efforts prune or merge tokens to address this issue,
they often rely on special tokens (e.g., CLS) or require task-specific
training, hindering scalability across architectures. In this paper, we propose
HiPrune, a training-free and model-agnostic token Pruning framework that
exploits the Hierarchical attention structure within vision encoders. We
identify that middle layers attend to object-centric regions, while deep layers
capture global contextual features. Based on this observation, HiPrune selects
three types of informative tokens: (1) Anchor tokens with high attention in
object-centric layers, (2) Buffer tokens adjacent to anchors for spatial
continuity, and (3) Register tokens with strong attention in deep layers for
global summarization. Our method requires no retraining and integrates
seamlessly with any ViT-based VLM. Extensive experiments on LLaVA-1.5,
LLaVA-NeXT, and Qwen2.5-VL demonstrate that HiPrune achieves state-of-the-art
pruning performance, preserving up to 99.3% task accuracy with only 33.3%
tokens, and maintaining 99.5% accuracy with just 11.1% tokens. Meanwhile, it
reduces inference FLOPs and latency by up to 9$\times$, showcasing strong
generalization across models and tasks. Code is available at

Motivation: 现有方法忽视类别冗余和视觉语言模糊性，导致次优的类别激活图。FreeCP旨在通过净化语义类别和纠正错误来提升性能。

Method: FreeCP通过净化语义类别和纠正冗余与模糊性带来的错误，生成最终的语义分割预测。

Result: 在八个基准测试中，FreeCP显著提升了分割性能，并可作为即插即用模块与其他方法结合。

Conclusion: FreeCP有效解决了开放词汇语义分割中的关键问题，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Fine-tuning pre-trained vision-language models has emerged as a powerful
approach for enhancing open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS). However,
the substantial computational and resource demands associated with training on
large datasets have prompted interest in training-free methods for OVSS.
Existing training-free approaches primarily focus on modifying model
architectures and generating prototypes to improve segmentation performance.
However, they often neglect the challenges posed by class redundancy, where
multiple categories are not present in the current test image, and
visual-language ambiguity, where semantic similarities among categories create
confusion in class activation. These issues can lead to suboptimal class
activation maps and affinity-refined activation maps. Motivated by these
observations, we propose FreeCP, a novel training-free class purification
framework designed to address these challenges. FreeCP focuses on purifying
semantic categories and rectifying errors caused by redundancy and ambiguity.
The purified class representations are then leveraged to produce final
segmentation predictions. We conduct extensive experiments across eight
benchmarks to validate FreeCP's effectiveness. Results demonstrate that FreeCP,
as a plug-and-play module, significantly boosts segmentation performance when
combined with other OVSS methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 铰接物体是日常环境中重要的可交互对象，但现有方法在物理合理性和点云对齐方面存在不足。

Method: 使用带符号距离函数（SDFs）表示部件形状，通过点云对齐损失和非穿透性、移动性约束引导扩散过程。

Result: 在PartNet-Mobility数据集上评估，PhysNAP在约束一致性和生成能力之间提供了平衡。

Conclusion: PhysNAP能够生成物理合理的铰接物体，并在点云对齐和约束一致性方面优于基线模型。

Abstract: Articulated objects are an important type of interactable objects in everyday
environments. In this paper, we propose PhysNAP, a novel diffusion model-based
approach for generating articulated objects that aligns them with partial point
clouds and improves their physical plausibility. The model represents part
shapes by signed distance functions (SDFs). We guide the reverse diffusion
process using a point cloud alignment loss computed using the predicted SDFs.
Additionally, we impose non-penetration and mobility constraints based on the
part SDFs for guiding the model to generate more physically plausible objects.
We also make our diffusion approach category-aware to further improve point
cloud alignment if category information is available. We evaluate the
generative ability and constraint consistency of samples generated with PhysNAP
using the PartNet-Mobility dataset. We also compare it with an unguided
baseline diffusion model and demonstrate that PhysNAP can improve constraint
consistency and provides a tradeoff with generative ability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于弱监督的领域特定目标检测算法，仅需图像级标注，显著降低标注成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有目标检测方法依赖大量标注框，标注成本高且需专家知识，限制了应用范围。

Method: 利用预训练模型知识蒸馏生成伪标签，通过优化方法缩小感受野直接提取目标，无需特定网络架构。

Result: 伪标签获取更便捷，且在标注时间有限的情况下优于其他弱标注方法甚至真实标注。

Conclusion: 该方法在降低标注成本的同时提升了检测性能，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Current state-of-the-art methods for object detection rely on annotated
bounding boxes of large data sets for training. However, obtaining such
annotations is expensive and can require up to hundreds of hours of manual
labor. This poses a challenge, especially since such annotations can only be
provided by experts, as they require knowledge about the scientific domain. To
tackle this challenge, we propose a domain-specific weakly supervised object
detection algorithm that only relies on image-level annotations, which are
significantly easier to acquire. Our method distills the knowledge of a
pre-trained model, on the task of predicting the presence or absence of a virus
in an image, to obtain a set of pseudo-labels that can be used to later train a
state-of-the-art object detection model. To do so, we use an optimization
approach with a shrinking receptive field to extract virus particles directly
without specific network architectures. Through a set of extensive studies, we
show how the proposed pseudo-labels are easier to obtain, and, more
importantly, are able to outperform other existing weak labeling methods, and
even ground truth labels, in cases where the time to obtain the annotation is
limited.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoProU-VO通过跨帧不确定性传播，改进了动态场景中的视觉里程计性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态物体和遮挡导致传统无监督视觉里程计在静态场景假设下失效，需改进不确定性建模。

Method: 提出CoProU-VO，结合目标帧和参考帧的不确定性，基于概率公式和视觉Transformer学习深度、不确定性和相机位姿。

Result: 在KITTI和nuScenes数据集上表现优于现有方法，尤其在高速公路场景中效果显著。

Conclusion: 跨帧不确定性传播有效提升动态场景中的视觉里程计性能。

Abstract: Visual Odometry (VO) is fundamental to autonomous navigation, robotics, and
augmented reality, with unsupervised approaches eliminating the need for
expensive ground-truth labels. However, these methods struggle when dynamic
objects violate the static scene assumption, leading to erroneous pose
estimations. We tackle this problem by uncertainty modeling, which is a
commonly used technique that creates robust masks to filter out dynamic objects
and occlusions without requiring explicit motion segmentation. Traditional
uncertainty modeling considers only single-frame information, overlooking the
uncertainties across consecutive frames. Our key insight is that uncertainty
must be propagated and combined across temporal frames to effectively identify
unreliable regions, particularly in dynamic scenes. To address this challenge,
we introduce Combined Projected Uncertainty VO (CoProU-VO), a novel end-to-end
approach that combines target frame uncertainty with projected reference frame
uncertainty using a principled probabilistic formulation. Built upon vision
transformer backbones, our model simultaneously learns depth, uncertainty
estimation, and camera poses. Consequently, experiments on the KITTI and
nuScenes datasets demonstrate significant improvements over previous
unsupervised monocular end-to-end two-frame-based methods and exhibit strong
performance in challenging highway scenes where other approaches often fail.
Additionally, comprehensive ablation studies validate the effectiveness of
cross-frame uncertainty propagation.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于不确定性感知的似然比估计方法，用于区分已知和未知像素特征，解决了语义分割模型在复杂场景中误分类未知对象的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实自动驾驶场景中，语义分割模型常因误分类未知对象而失败，现有方法在复杂场景中表现不佳。

Method: 采用基于证据分类器的似然比测试，结合不确定性估计，输出概率分布而非点估计。

Result: 在五个标准数据集上，方法实现了最低的平均假阳性率（2.5%），同时保持高平均精度（90.91%），计算开销可忽略。

Conclusion: 通过显式考虑不确定性，该方法有效提升了未知对象的检测性能，且计算效率高。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation models trained on known object classes often fail in
real-world autonomous driving scenarios by confidently misclassifying unknown
objects. While pixel-wise out-of-distribution detection can identify unknown
objects, existing methods struggle in complex scenes where rare object classes
are often confused with truly unknown objects. We introduce an
uncertainty-aware likelihood ratio estimation method that addresses these
limitations. Our approach uses an evidential classifier within a likelihood
ratio test to distinguish between known and unknown pixel features from a
semantic segmentation model, while explicitly accounting for uncertainty.
Instead of producing point estimates, our method outputs probability
distributions that capture uncertainty from both rare training examples and
imperfect synthetic outliers. We show that by incorporating uncertainty in this
way, outlier exposure can be leveraged more effectively. Evaluated on five
standard benchmark datasets, our method achieves the lowest average false
positive rate (2.5%) among state-of-the-art while maintaining high average
precision (90.91%) and incurring only negligible computational overhead. Code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NTL数据时间覆盖有限（始于2012年），且现有方法存在光强低估和结构缺失问题，限制了长期时间序列研究。

Method: 采用两阶段重建框架：构建阶段使用分层融合解码器（HFD）提高初始重建保真度；细化阶段利用双特征细化器（DFR）结合高分辨率不透水面掩模增强细节。

Result: 开发的EVAL产品将VIIRS数据回溯至1986年，R²从0.68提升至0.80，RMSE从1.27降至0.99，具有优异的时间一致性和社会经济参数相关性。

Conclusion: EVAL为研究社区提供了可靠的长期分析资源，解决了现有NTL数据的局限性。

Abstract: Artificial Night-Time Light (NTL) remote sensing is a vital proxy for
quantifying the intensity and spatial distribution of human activities.
Although the NPP-VIIRS sensor provides high-quality NTL observations, its
temporal coverage, which begins in 2012, restricts long-term time-series
studies that extend to earlier periods. Despite the progress in extending
VIIRS-like NTL time-series, current methods still suffer from two significant
shortcomings: the underestimation of light intensity and the structural
omission. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel reconstruction
framework consisting of a two-stage process: construction and refinement. The
construction stage features a Hierarchical Fusion Decoder (HFD) designed to
enhance the fidelity of the initial reconstruction. The refinement stage
employs a Dual Feature Refiner (DFR), which leverages high-resolution
impervious surface masks to guide and enhance fine-grained structural details.
Based on this framework, we developed the Extended VIIRS-like Artificial
Nighttime Light (EVAL) product for China, extending the standard data record
backwards by 26 years to begin in 1986. Quantitative evaluation shows that EVAL
significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art products, boosting the
$\text{R}^2$ from 0.68 to 0.80 while lowering the RMSE from 1.27 to 0.99.
Furthermore, EVAL exhibits excellent temporal consistency and maintains a high
correlation with socioeconomic parameters, confirming its reliability for
long-term analysis. The resulting EVAL dataset provides a valuable new resource
for the research community and is publicly available at
https://doi.org/10.11888/HumanNat.tpdc.302930.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于Transformer的NSFW检测框架Wukong，利用扩散模型早期去噪步骤的中间输出，实现了高效且准确的NSFW内容检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的NSFW检测方法（文本过滤和图像过滤）存在效率低或易受攻击的问题，需要一种更高效且准确的方法。

Method: Wukong利用扩散模型早期去噪步骤的中间输出和预训练的U-Net交叉注意力参数，在图像生成过程中进行早期检测。

Result: Wukong在效率和准确性上显著优于文本过滤方法，并与图像过滤方法相当。

Conclusion: Wukong提供了一种高效且准确的NSFW检测解决方案，适用于现代T2I系统。

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) generation is a popular AI-generated content (AIGC)
technology enabling diverse and creative image synthesis. However, some outputs
may contain Not Safe For Work (NSFW) content (e.g., violence), violating
community guidelines. Detecting NSFW content efficiently and accurately, known
as external safeguarding, is essential. Existing external safeguards fall into
two types: text filters, which analyze user prompts but overlook T2I
model-specific variations and are prone to adversarial attacks; and image
filters, which analyze final generated images but are computationally costly
and introduce latency. Diffusion models, the foundation of modern T2I systems
like Stable Diffusion, generate images through iterative denoising using a
U-Net architecture with ResNet and Transformer blocks. We observe that: (1)
early denoising steps define the semantic layout of the image, and (2)
cross-attention layers in U-Net are crucial for aligning text and image
regions. Based on these insights, we propose Wukong, a transformer-based NSFW
detection framework that leverages intermediate outputs from early denoising
steps and reuses U-Net's pre-trained cross-attention parameters. Wukong
operates within the diffusion process, enabling early detection without waiting
for full image generation. We also introduce a new dataset containing prompts,
seeds, and image-specific NSFW labels, and evaluate Wukong on this and two
public benchmarks. Results show that Wukong significantly outperforms
text-based safeguards and achieves comparable accuracy of image filters, while
offering much greater efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 复杂场景中的运动场具有多样化和异构的运动模式，现有方法缺乏针对性建模策略，导致估计结果偏离真实结构。

Method: 采用概率先验引导分解策略将运动场分解为异构子场，并通过MoE增强的双路径校正器进行针对性建模。

Result: GeoMoE在相对姿态和单应性估计任务中优于现有方法，并表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: GeoMoE通过简洁设计有效解决了异构运动模式的建模问题，提升了运动场估计的精度。

Abstract: Recent progress in two-view geometry increasingly emphasizes enforcing
smoothness and global consistency priors when estimating motion fields between
pairs of images. However, in complex real-world scenes, characterized by
extreme viewpoint and scale changes as well as pronounced depth
discontinuities, the motion field often exhibits diverse and heterogeneous
motion patterns. Most existing methods lack targeted modeling strategies and
fail to explicitly account for this variability, resulting in estimated motion
fields that diverge from their true underlying structure and distribution. We
observe that Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) can assign dedicated experts to motion
sub-fields, enabling a divide-and-conquer strategy for heterogeneous motion
patterns. Building on this insight, we re-architect motion field modeling in
two-view geometry with GeoMoE, a streamlined framework. Specifically, we first
devise a Probabilistic Prior-Guided Decomposition strategy that exploits inlier
probability signals to perform a structure-aware decomposition of the motion
field into heterogeneous sub-fields, sharply curbing outlier-induced bias.
Next, we introduce an MoE-Enhanced Bi-Path Rectifier that enhances each
sub-field along spatial-context and channel-semantic paths and routes it to a
customized expert for targeted modeling, thereby decoupling heterogeneous
motion regimes, suppressing cross-sub-field interference and representational
entanglement, and yielding fine-grained motion-field rectification. With this
minimalist design, GeoMoE outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods in
relative pose and homography estimation and shows strong generalization. The

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DPoser-X是一种基于扩散的3D全身人体姿态先验模型，通过扩散模型和变分扩散采样解决姿态任务，结合截断时间步调度和掩码训练机制，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建一个通用且鲁棒的全身人体姿态先验模型面临挑战，主要由于人体姿态的复杂性和高质量数据集的稀缺性。

Method: 提出扩散模型DPoser，并扩展为DPoser-X，采用变分扩散采样统一姿态任务，引入截断时间步调度和掩码训练机制。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，优于现有方法，为全身姿态先验建模设定了新标准。

Conclusion: DPoser-X通过创新方法解决了姿态建模的挑战，展现了鲁棒性和通用性。

Abstract: We present DPoser-X, a diffusion-based prior model for 3D whole-body human
poses. Building a versatile and robust full-body human pose prior remains
challenging due to the inherent complexity of articulated human poses and the
scarcity of high-quality whole-body pose datasets. To address these
limitations, we introduce a Diffusion model as body Pose prior (DPoser) and
extend it to DPoser-X for expressive whole-body human pose modeling. Our
approach unifies various pose-centric tasks as inverse problems, solving them
through variational diffusion sampling. To enhance performance on downstream
applications, we introduce a novel truncated timestep scheduling method
specifically designed for pose data characteristics. We also propose a masked
training mechanism that effectively combines whole-body and part-specific
datasets, enabling our model to capture interdependencies between body parts
while avoiding overfitting to specific actions. Extensive experiments
demonstrate DPoser-X's robustness and versatility across multiple benchmarks
for body, hand, face, and full-body pose modeling. Our model consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives, establishing a new benchmark for
whole-body human pose prior modeling.

a Landmark Shift Attack that backdoors the coordinate regression task performed
by face detectors. We then offer mitigations against these vulnerabilities.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过生成模型合成属性标注数据的方法，以解决医学图像数据集中属性标注稀缺的问题，并提升可解释模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 增强医学图像诊断中可解释模型的透明性和实用性，解决属性标注数据稀缺的挑战。

Method: 使用扩散模型生成属性标注数据，仅需少量真实标注样本（20个肺结节样本），并将其用于训练可解释模型。

Result: 合成数据显著提升了模型性能，属性预测准确率提高13.4%，目标预测准确率提高1.8%。

Conclusion: 合成数据能有效克服数据集限制，提升可解释模型在医学图像分析中的适用性。

Abstract: Classification models that provide human-interpretable explanations enhance
clinicians' trust and usability in medical image diagnosis. One research focus
is the integration and prediction of pathology-related visual attributes used
by radiologists alongside the diagnosis, aligning AI decision-making with
clinical reasoning. Radiologists use attributes like shape and texture as
established diagnostic criteria and mirroring these in AI decision-making both
enhances transparency and enables explicit validation of model outputs.
However, the adoption of such models is limited by the scarcity of large-scale
medical image datasets annotated with these attributes. To address this
challenge, we propose synthesizing attribute-annotated data using a generative
model. We enhance the Diffusion Model with attribute conditioning and train it
using only 20 attribute-labeled lung nodule samples from the LIDC-IDRI dataset.
Incorporating its generated images into the training of an explainable model
boosts performance, increasing attribute prediction accuracy by 13.4% and
target prediction accuracy by 1.8% compared to training with only the small
real attribute-annotated dataset. This work highlights the potential of
synthetic data to overcome dataset limitations, enhancing the applicability of
explainable models in medical image analysis.

TL;DR: 论文提出了首个针对目标检测器补丁攻击的防御基准，通过大规模数据集和综合分析揭示了防御性能的关键因素，并提供了改进防御方法的指导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御评估缺乏统一框架，导致对补丁攻击防御方法的评估不一致且不完整。

Method: 重新评估11种代表性防御方法，构建包含2种攻击目标、13种补丁攻击、11种目标检测器和4种指标的基准，并创建大规模对抗补丁数据集。

Result: 发现数据分布是防御自然补丁的关键，新数据集可提升现有防御性能15.09%；攻击目标的平均精度与防御性能高度一致；自适应攻击可绕过现有防御。

Conclusion: 研究为补丁攻击/防御的评估和设计提供了指导，未来将持续更新基准。

Abstract: Developing reliable defenses against patch attacks on object detectors has
attracted increasing interest. However, we identify that existing defense
evaluations lack a unified and comprehensive framework, resulting in
inconsistent and incomplete assessments of current methods. To address this
issue, we revisit 11 representative defenses and present the first patch
defense benchmark, involving 2 attack goals, 13 patch attacks, 11 object
detectors, and 4 diverse metrics. This leads to the large-scale adversarial
patch dataset with 94 types of patches and 94,000 images. Our comprehensive
analyses reveal new insights: (1) The difficulty in defending against
naturalistic patches lies in the data distribution, rather than the commonly
believed high frequencies. Our new dataset with diverse patch distributions can
be used to improve existing defenses by 15.09% AP@0.5. (2) The average
precision of the attacked object, rather than the commonly pursued patch
detection accuracy, shows high consistency with defense performance. (3)
Adaptive attacks can substantially bypass existing defenses, and defenses with
complex/stochastic models or universal patch properties are relatively robust.
We hope that our analyses will serve as guidance on properly evaluating patch
attacks/defenses and advancing their design. Code and dataset are available at
https://github.com/Gandolfczjh/APDE, where we will keep integrating new
attacks/defenses.

Result: 实验验证了方法的有效性和广泛适用性。

Conclusion: 预训练深度特征在去雾任务中具有一致性，提出的模块提升了去雾性能。

Abstract: Image dehazing remains a challenging problem due to the spatially varying
nature of haze in real-world scenes. While existing methods have demonstrated
the promise of large-scale pretrained models for image dehazing, their
architecture-specific designs hinder adaptability across diverse scenarios with
different accuracy and efficiency requirements. In this work, we systematically
investigate the generalization capability of pretrained depth
representations-learned from millions of diverse images-for image dehazing. Our
empirical analysis reveals that the learned deep depth features maintain
remarkable consistency across varying haze levels. Building on this insight, we
propose a plug-and-play RGB-D fusion module that seamlessly integrates with
diverse dehazing architectures. Extensive experiments across multiple
benchmarks validate both the effectiveness and broad applicability of our
approach.

Result: 在4个开源数据集上验证了D3的优越性，例如在Gen-Video上比之前最佳方法提高了10.39%。

Conclusion: D3在计算效率和鲁棒性方面表现优异，为合成视频检测提供了新思路。

Abstract: The evolution of video generation techniques, such as Sora, has made it
increasingly easy to produce high-fidelity AI-generated videos, raising public
concern over the dissemination of synthetic content. However, existing
detection methodologies remain limited by their insufficient exploration of
temporal artifacts in synthetic videos. To bridge this gap, we establish a
theoretical framework through second-order dynamical analysis under Newtonian
mechanics, subsequently extending the Second-order Central Difference features
tailored for temporal artifact detection. Building on this theoretical
foundation, we reveal a fundamental divergence in second-order feature
distributions between real and AI-generated videos. Concretely, we propose
Detection by Difference of Differences (D3), a novel training-free detection
method that leverages the above second-order temporal discrepancies. We
validate the superiority of our D3 on 4 open-source datasets (Gen-Video,
VideoPhy, EvalCrafter, VidProM), 40 subsets in total. For example, on GenVideo,
D3 outperforms the previous best method by 10.39% (absolute) mean Average
Precision. Additional experiments on time cost and post-processing operations
demonstrate D3's exceptional computational efficiency and strong robust
performance. Our code is available at https://github.com/Zig-HS/D3.

Conclusion: 动态注意力平衡机制在多图像场景中表现出色，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Despite growing interest in hallucination in Multimodal Large Language
Models, existing studies primarily focus on single-image settings, leaving
hallucination in multi-image scenarios largely unexplored. To address this gap,
we conduct the first systematic study of hallucinations in multi-image MLLMs
and propose MIHBench, a benchmark specifically tailored for evaluating
object-related hallucinations across multiple images. MIHBench comprises three
core tasks: Multi-Image Object Existence Hallucination, Multi-Image Object
Count Hallucination, and Object Identity Consistency Hallucination, targeting
semantic understanding across object existence, quantity reasoning, and
cross-view identity consistency. Through extensive evaluation, we identify key
factors associated with the occurrence of multi-image hallucinations,
including: a progressive relationship between the number of image inputs and
the likelihood of hallucination occurrences; a strong correlation between
single-image hallucination tendencies and those observed in multi-image
contexts; and the influence of same-object image ratios and the positional
placement of negative samples within image sequences on the occurrence of
object identity consistency hallucination. To address these challenges, we
propose a Dynamic Attention Balancing mechanism that adjusts inter-image
attention distributions while preserving the overall visual attention
proportion. Experiments across multiple state-of-the-art MLLMs demonstrate that
our method effectively reduces hallucination occurrences and enhances semantic
integration and reasoning stability in multi-image scenarios.

Method: 提出'cardinality'映射作为回归目标，结合表示对齐和强弱监督混合方案，采用全可微分架构。

Result: 在实验中表现出最先进的计数准确性，并为文本到图像系统提供鲁棒的数量控制。

Conclusion: YOLO-Count在计数和生成控制方面均表现出色，为相关领域提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We propose YOLO-Count, a differentiable open-vocabulary object counting model
that tackles both general counting challenges and enables precise quantity
control for text-to-image (T2I) generation. A core contribution is the
'cardinality' map, a novel regression target that accounts for variations in
object size and spatial distribution. Leveraging representation alignment and a
hybrid strong-weak supervision scheme, YOLO-Count bridges the gap between
open-vocabulary counting and T2I generation control. Its fully differentiable
architecture facilitates gradient-based optimization, enabling accurate object
count estimation and fine-grained guidance for generative models. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that YOLO-Count achieves state-of-the-art counting
accuracy while providing robust and effective quantity control for T2I systems.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种轻量级骨干网络Dense Backbone，用于LiDAR点云的3D目标检测，显著降低了计算成本，同时保持了高检测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D目标检测方法多依赖复杂骨干网络（如VGG或ResNet），增加了模型复杂度。轻量级骨干在2D检测中已有研究，但在3D检测中仍有限。

Method: 设计了Dense Backbone，结合高处理速度、轻量架构和鲁棒检测精度，适配了多种先进3D检测器（如PillarNet）。

Result: DensePillarNet在nuScenes测试集上参数减少29%，延迟降低28%，检测精度仅下降2%。

Conclusion: Dense Backbone的即插即用设计易于集成到现有架构中，无需修改其他网络组件。

Abstract: Recent advancements in LiDAR-based 3D object detection have significantly
accelerated progress toward the realization of fully autonomous driving in
real-world environments. Despite achieving high detection performance, most of
the approaches still rely on a VGG-based or ResNet-based backbone for feature
exploration, which increases the model complexity. Lightweight backbone design
is well-explored for 2D object detection, but research on 3D object detection
still remains limited. In this work, we introduce Dense Backbone, a lightweight
backbone that combines the benefits of high processing speed, lightweight
architecture, and robust detection accuracy. We adapt multiple SoTA 3d object
detectors, such as PillarNet, with our backbone and show that with our
backbone, these models retain most of their detection capability at a
significantly reduced computational cost. To our knowledge, this is the first
dense-layer-based backbone tailored specifically for 3D object detection from
point cloud data. DensePillarNet, our adaptation of PillarNet, achieves a 29%
reduction in model parameters and a 28% reduction in latency with just a 2%
drop in detection accuracy on the nuScenes test set. Furthermore, Dense
Backbone's plug-and-play design allows straightforward integration into
existing architectures, requiring no modifications to other network components.

Motivation: 当前自监督视觉基础模型在捕捉语义对应时缺乏对3D几何的感知，GECO旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 采用最优传输的训练框架，生成几何一致的特征，支持遮挡和去遮挡情况下的监督。

Result: GECO在PFPascal、APK和CUB上分别提升了6.0%、6.2%和4.1%的PCK指标，运行速度达30 fps，比现有方法快98.2%。

Conclusion: PCK指标不足以全面评估几何质量，GECO提出了新指标和见解，推动更几何感知的特征学习。

Abstract: Recent advances in feature learning have shown that self-supervised vision
foundation models can capture semantic correspondences but often lack awareness
of underlying 3D geometry. GECO addresses this gap by producing geometrically
coherent features that semantically distinguish parts based on geometry (e.g.,
left/right eyes, front/back legs). We propose a training framework based on
optimal transport, enabling supervision beyond keypoints, even under occlusions
and disocclusions. With a lightweight architecture, GECO runs at 30 fps, 98.2%
faster than prior methods, while achieving state-of-the-art performance on
PFPascal, APK, and CUB, improving PCK by 6.0%, 6.2%, and 4.1%, respectively.
Finally, we show that PCK alone is insufficient to capture geometric quality
and introduce new metrics and insights for more geometry-aware feature
learning. Link to project page:

Conclusion: 研究强调了在虚拟化身通信系统中加强行为生物特征防御的紧迫性，并提供了公开的基准和系统。

Abstract: Photorealistic talking-head avatars are becoming increasingly common in
virtual meetings, gaming, and social platforms. These avatars allow for more
immersive communication, but they also introduce serious security risks. One
emerging threat is impersonation: an attacker can steal a user's
avatar-preserving their appearance and voice-making it nearly impossible to
detect its fraudulent usage by sight or sound alone. In this paper, we explore
the challenge of biometric verification in such avatar-mediated scenarios. Our
main question is whether an individual's facial motion patterns can serve as
reliable behavioral biometrics to verify their identity when the avatar's
visual appearance is a facsimile of its owner. To answer this question, we
introduce a new dataset of realistic avatar videos created using a
state-of-the-art one-shot avatar generation model, GAGAvatar, with genuine and
impostor avatar videos. We also propose a lightweight, explainable
spatio-temporal Graph Convolutional Network architecture with temporal
attention pooling, that uses only facial landmarks to model dynamic facial
gestures. Experimental results demonstrate that facial motion cues enable
meaningful identity verification with AUC values approaching 80%. The proposed
benchmark and biometric system are available for the research community in
order to bring attention to the urgent need for more advanced behavioral
biometric defenses in avatar-based communication systems.

Result: 在PSNR、SSIM和LPIPS指标上与基线ESRGAN相当，适用于卫星和无人机图像处理。

Conclusion: SU-ESRGAN在跨域应用中表现良好，强调了领域感知训练的重要性。

Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have achieved realistic
super-resolution (SR) of images however, they lack semantic consistency and
per-pixel confidence, limiting their credibility in critical remote sensing
applications such as disaster response, urban planning and agriculture. This
paper introduces Semantic and Uncertainty-Aware ESRGAN (SU-ESRGAN), the first
SR framework designed for satellite imagery to integrate the ESRGAN,
segmentation loss via DeepLabv3 for class detail preservation and Monte Carlo
dropout to produce pixel-wise uncertainty maps. The SU-ESRGAN produces results
(PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS) comparable to the Baseline ESRGAN on aerial imagery. This
novel model is valuable in satellite systems or UAVs that use wide
field-of-view (FoV) cameras, trading off spatial resolution for coverage. The
modular design allows integration in UAV data pipelines for on-board or
post-processing SR to enhance imagery resulting due to motion blur, compression
and sensor limitations. Further, the model is fine-tuned to evaluate its
performance on cross domain applications. The tests are conducted on two drone
based datasets which differ in altitude and imaging perspective. Performance
evaluation of the fine-tuned models show a stronger adaptation to the Aerial
Maritime Drone Dataset, whose imaging characteristics align with the training
data, highlighting the importance of domain-aware training in SR-applications.

Motivation: 现有医学图像转换技术在处理分布外样本时性能下降，需要一种动态适应方法以提升模型鲁棒性。

Method: 引入重建模块量化域偏移，并结合动态适应块选择性调整预训练模型特征，避免对分布内样本的不必要修改。

Result: 在低剂量CT去噪和T1到T2 MRI转换任务中，性能优于基线模型和现有TTA方法。

Conclusion: 动态样本特异性调整是提升模型在真实场景中鲁棒性的有效途径。

Abstract: Image-to-image translation has emerged as a powerful technique in medical
imaging, enabling tasks such as image denoising and cross-modality conversion.
However, it suffers from limitations in handling out-of-distribution samples
without causing performance degradation. To address this limitation, we propose
a novel Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) framework that dynamically adjusts the
translation process based on the characteristics of each test sample. Our
method introduces a Reconstruction Module to quantify the domain shift and a
Dynamic Adaptation Block that selectively modifies the internal features of a
pretrained translation model to mitigate the shift without compromising the
performance on in-distribution samples that do not require adaptation. We
evaluate our approach on two medical image-to-image translation tasks: low-dose
CT denoising and T1 to T2 MRI translation, showing consistent improvements over
both the baseline translation model without TTA and prior TTA methods. Our
analysis highlights the limitations of the state-of-the-art that uniformly
apply the adaptation to both out-of-distribution and in-distribution samples,
demonstrating that dynamic, sample-specific adjustment offers a promising path
to improve model resilience in real-world scenarios. The code is available at:

Motivation: 现有零样本异常检测方法在域转移下表现不佳，因其训练数据有限且无法适应新分布。

Method: 1. 双分支提示学习机制动态整合可学习提示与语义属性；2. 无标签测试时适应策略利用高置信度伪标签更新提示参数。

Result: 在13个工业和医学基准测试中，PILOT在域转移下的异常检测和定位性能达到最优。

Conclusion: PILOT通过动态提示学习和测试时适应，显著提升了零样本异常检测的泛化能力。

Abstract: Zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD) enables identifying and localizing defects
in unseen categories by relying solely on generalizable features rather than
requiring any labeled examples of anomalies. However, existing ZSAD methods,
whether using fixed or learned prompts, struggle under domain shifts because
their training data are derived from limited training domains and fail to
generalize to new distributions. In this paper, we introduce PILOT, a framework
designed to overcome these challenges through two key innovations: (1) a novel
dual-branch prompt learning mechanism that dynamically integrates a pool of
learnable prompts with structured semantic attributes, enabling the model to
adaptively weight the most relevant anomaly cues for each input image; and (2)
a label-free test-time adaptation strategy that updates the learnable prompt
parameters using high-confidence pseudo-labels from unlabeled test data.
Extensive experiments on 13 industrial and medical benchmarks demonstrate that
PILOT achieves state-of-the-art performance in both anomaly detection and
localization under domain shift.

Abstract: This study analyzes semantic segmentation performance across heterogeneously
labeled point-cloud datasets relevant to public safety applications, including
pre-incident planning systems derived from lidar scans. Using NIST's Point
Cloud City dataset (Enfield and Memphis collections), we investigate challenges
in unifying differently labeled 3D data. Our methodology employs a graded
schema with the KPConv architecture, evaluating performance through IoU metrics
on safety-relevant features. Results indicate performance variability:
geometrically large objects (e.g. stairs, windows) achieve higher segmentation
performance, suggesting potential for navigational context, while smaller
safety-critical features exhibit lower recognition rates. Performance is
impacted by class imbalance and the limited geometric distinction of smaller
objects in typical lidar scans, indicating limitations in detecting certain
safety-relevant features using current point-cloud methods. Key identified
challenges include insufficient labeled data, difficulties in unifying class
labels across datasets, and the need for standardization. Potential directions
include automated labeling and multi-dataset learning strategies. We conclude
that reliable point-cloud semantic segmentation for public safety necessitates
standardized annotation protocols and improved labeling techniques to address
data heterogeneity and the detection of small, safety-critical elements.

### [90] [Robust Model Reconstruction Based on the Topological Understanding of Point Clouds Using Persistent Homology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00251)
*Yu Chen,Hongwei Lin*

Main category: cs.CG

TL;DR: 提出一种自动方法，利用持久同调理论和2-循环区分和分离点云中的闭合曲面，结合Loop细分和LSPIA技术完成高质量模型重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 处理多组件、含噪声的点云模型重建问题，尤其是共享区域的闭合曲面自动识别与分离的复杂性。

Method: 结合持久同调理论的拓扑理解和2-循环表示，使用Loop细分和LSPIA技术生成高质量曲面。

Result: 方法对噪声鲁棒，实验证明其有效性，适用于实际应用。

Conclusion: 该方法在复杂点云模型重建中表现出色，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Reconstructing models from unorganized point clouds presents a significant
challenge, especially when the models consist of multiple components
represented by their surface point clouds. Such models often involve point
clouds with noise that represent multiple closed surfaces with shared regions,
making their automatic identification and separation inherently complex. In
this paper, we propose an automatic method that uses the topological
understanding provided by persistent homology, along with representative
2-cycles of persistent homology groups, to effectively distinguish and separate
each closed surface. Furthermore, we employ Loop subdivision and least squares
progressive iterative approximation (LSPIA) techniques to generate high-quality
final surfaces and achieve complete model reconstruction. Our method is robust
to noise in the point cloud, making it suitable for reconstructing models from
such data. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
and highlight its potential for practical applications.

### [91] [Occlusion-robust Stylization for Drawing-based 3D Animation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00398)
*Sunjae Yoon,Gwanhyeong Koo,Younghwan Lee,Ji Woo Hong,Chang D. Yoo*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于光流的遮挡鲁棒风格化框架（OSF），用于解决绘图风格在3D动画中的退化问题，尤其是在遮挡情况下。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在遮挡情况下会导致绘图风格退化（如轮廓闪烁和笔划模糊），这是由于训练和推理时的姿态差异（即'风格化姿态间隙'）引起的。

Method: OSF利用光流提供遮挡鲁棒的边缘引导，确保风格一致性，并采用单阶段方法替代传统的两阶段方法。

Result: OSF在遮挡情况下表现更稳定，推理速度提升2.4倍，内存消耗减少2.1倍。

Conclusion: OSF有效解决了绘图风格在3D动画中的退化问题，提升了效率和鲁棒性。

Abstract: 3D animation aims to generate a 3D animated video from an input image and a
target 3D motion sequence. Recent advances in image-to-3D models enable the
creation of animations directly from user-hand drawings. Distinguished from
conventional 3D animation, drawing-based 3D animation is crucial to preserve
artist's unique style properties, such as rough contours and distinct stroke
patterns. However, recent methods still exhibit quality deterioration in style
properties, especially under occlusions caused by overlapping body parts,
leading to contour flickering and stroke blurring. This occurs due to a
`stylization pose gap' between training and inference in stylization networks
designed to preserve drawing styles in drawing-based 3D animation systems. The
stylization pose gap denotes that input target poses used to train the
stylization network are always in occlusion-free poses, while target poses
encountered in an inference include diverse occlusions under dynamic motions.
To this end, we propose Occlusion-robust Stylization Framework (OSF) for
drawing-based 3D animation. We found that while employing object's edge can be
effective input prior for guiding stylization, it becomes notably inaccurate
when occlusions occur at inference. Thus, our proposed OSF provides
occlusion-robust edge guidance for stylization network using optical flow,
ensuring a consistent stylization even under occlusions. Furthermore, OSF
operates in a single run instead of the previous two-stage method, achieving
2.4x faster inference and 2.1x less memory.

TL;DR: CrossSet是一种用于联合研究两个集合类型维度及其交互的新方法，通过多尺度交互式可视化分析集合类型数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅支持单个集合类型维度的研究，而联合分析两个维度的交互需求尚未满足。

Method: 采用分层矩阵布局联合可视化两个集合类型维度，支持多尺度交互探索。

Result: CrossSet在多个应用场景中验证了其有效性和高效性。

Conclusion: CrossSet为双变量集合类型数据的交互式可视化分析提供了新方法。

Abstract: The interactive visual analysis of set-typed data, i.e., data with attributes
that are of type set, is a rewarding area of research and applications.
Valuable prior work has contributed solutions that enable the study of such
data with individual set-typed dimensions. In this paper, we present CrossSet,
a novel method for the joint study of two set-typed dimensions and their
interplay. Based on a task analysis, we describe a new, multi-scale approach to
the interactive visual exploration and analysis of such data. Two set-typed
data dimensions are jointly visualized using a hierarchical matrix layout,
enabling the analysis of the interactions between two set-typed attributes at
several levels, in addition to the analysis of individual such dimensions.
CrossSet is anchored at a compact, large-scale overview that is complemented by
drill-down opportunities to study the relations between and within the
set-typed dimensions, enabling an interactive visual multi-scale exploration
and analysis of bivariate set-typed data. Such an interactive approach makes it
possible to study single set-typed dimensions in detail, to gain an overview of
the interaction and association between two such dimensions, to refine one of
the dimensions to gain additional details at several levels, and to drill down
to the specific interactions of individual set-elements from the set-typed
dimensions. To demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of CrossSet, we
have evaluated the new method in the context of several application scenarios.

Result: 测试和用户研究表明，Sel3DCraft在支持设计师创造力方面优于其他文本到3D生成系统。

Conclusion: Sel3DCraft通过创新的视觉提示工程方法，显著提升了3D生成的可控性和设计效率。

Abstract: Text-to-3D (T23D) generation has transformed digital content creation, yet
remains bottlenecked by blind trial-and-error prompting processes that yield
unpredictable results. While visual prompt engineering has advanced in
text-to-image domains, its application to 3D generation presents unique
challenges requiring multi-view consistency evaluation and spatial
understanding. We present Sel3DCraft, a visual prompt engineering system for
T23D that transforms unstructured exploration into a guided visual process. Our
approach introduces three key innovations: a dual-branch structure combining
retrieval and generation for diverse candidate exploration; a multi-view hybrid
scoring approach that leverages MLLMs with innovative high-level metrics to
assess 3D models with human-expert consistency; and a prompt-driven visual
analytics suite that enables intuitive defect identification and refinement.
Extensive testing and user studies demonstrate that Sel3DCraft surpasses other
T23D systems in supporting creativity for designers.

TL;DR: SpA2V框架通过利用音频中的空间听觉线索生成语义和空间对齐的视频，分为音频引导的视频规划和布局基础的视频生成两阶段。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注语义信息，忽略了音频中的空间属性（如位置和运动方向），而人类能够自然识别这些信息。SpA2V旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 1）音频引导的视频规划：利用MLLM从音频中提取空间和语义线索，构建视频场景布局（VSL）；2）布局基础的视频生成：将VSL作为条件输入预训练的扩散模型，实现无训练的视频生成。

Result: 实验表明，SpA2V能生成与输入音频在语义和空间上高度对齐的逼真视频。

Conclusion: SpA2V通过显式利用空间听觉线索，显著提升了音频驱动视频生成的语义和空间准确性。

Abstract: Audio-driven video generation aims to synthesize realistic videos that align
with input audio recordings, akin to the human ability to visualize scenes from
auditory input. However, existing approaches predominantly focus on exploring
semantic information, such as the classes of sounding sources present in the
audio, limiting their ability to generate videos with accurate content and
spatial composition. In contrast, we humans can not only naturally identify the
semantic categories of sounding sources but also determine their deeply encoded
spatial attributes, including locations and movement directions. This useful
information can be elucidated by considering specific spatial indicators
derived from the inherent physical properties of sound, such as loudness or
frequency. As prior methods largely ignore this factor, we present SpA2V, the
first framework explicitly exploits these spatial auditory cues from audios to
generate videos with high semantic and spatial correspondence. SpA2V decomposes
the generation process into two stages: 1) Audio-guided Video Planning: We
meticulously adapt a state-of-the-art MLLM for a novel task of harnessing
spatial and semantic cues from input audio to construct Video Scene Layouts
(VSLs). This serves as an intermediate representation to bridge the gap between
the audio and video modalities. 2) Layout-grounded Video Generation: We develop
an efficient and effective approach to seamlessly integrate VSLs as conditional
guidance into pre-trained diffusion models, enabling VSL-grounded video
generation in a training-free manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
SpA2V excels in generating realistic videos with semantic and spatial alignment
to the input audios.

manipulation tasks and validate data quality by training VLA models that
exhibit robust autonomous performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in teleoperation have demonstrated robots performing complex

joint-level teleoperation for humanoid robots, limiting the diversity of tasks
that can be accomplished. This work presents Controller for Humanoid Imitation

standard baby carrier, allowing the operator control over all four limbs, and
supports both direct joint mapping for full-body control and loco-manipulation.
Adaptive force feedback is incorporated to enhance operator experience and
prevent unsafe joint movements. We validate the capabilities of this system by
conducting loco-manipulation and full-body control examples on a humanoid robot
and multiple dual-arm systems. Lastly, we open-source the design of the
hardware promoting accessibility and reproducibility. Additional details and

Abstract: This paper presents a topology-inspired morphological descriptor for soft
continuum robots by combining a pseudo-rigid-body (PRB) model with Morse theory
to achieve a quantitative characterization of robot morphologies. By counting
critical points of directional projections, the proposed descriptor enables a
discrete representation of multimodal configurations and facilitates
morphological classification. Furthermore, we apply the descriptor to
morphology control by formulating the target configuration as an optimization
problem to compute actuation parameters that generate equilibrium shapes with
desired topological features. The proposed framework provides a unified
methodology for quantitative morphology description, classification, and
control of soft continuum robots, with the potential to enhance their precision
and adaptability in medical applications such as minimally invasive surgery and
endovascular interventions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多依赖语言指令导航（VLN），限制了无人机的扩展性和自主性。UAV-ON旨在填补这一空白，推动无人机在复杂环境中的语义目标导航研究。

Method: 提出UAV-ON基准，包含14个高保真环境和1270个标注目标，支持语义目标驱动的导航。开发了Aerial ObjectNav Agent（AOA）等基线方法。

Result: 基线方法在UAV-ON中表现不佳，突显了空中导航和语义目标理解的挑战。

Conclusion: UAV-ON为无人机在复杂环境中的语义目标导航研究提供了新方向，强调了自主性和扩展性的重要性。

Abstract: Aerial navigation is a fundamental yet underexplored capability in embodied
intelligence, enabling agents to operate in large-scale, unstructured
environments where traditional navigation paradigms fall short. However, most
existing research follows the Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) paradigm,
which heavily depends on sequential linguistic instructions, limiting its
scalability and autonomy. To address this gap, we introduce UAV-ON, a benchmark
for large-scale Object Goal Navigation (ObjectNav) by aerial agents in
open-world environments, where agents operate based on high-level semantic
goals without relying on detailed instructional guidance as in VLN. UAV-ON
comprises 14 high-fidelity Unreal Engine environments with diverse semantic
regions and complex spatial layouts, covering urban, natural, and mixed-use
settings. It defines 1270 annotated target objects, each characterized by an
instance-level instruction that encodes category, physical footprint, and
visual descriptors, allowing grounded reasoning. These instructions serve as
semantic goals, introducing realistic ambiguity and complex reasoning
challenges for aerial agents. To evaluate the benchmark, we implement several
baseline methods, including Aerial ObjectNav Agent (AOA), a modular policy that
integrates instruction semantics with egocentric observations for long-horizon,
goal-directed exploration. Empirical results show that all baselines struggle
in this setting, highlighting the compounded challenges of aerial navigation
and semantic goal grounding. UAV-ON aims to advance research on scalable UAV
autonomy driven by semantic goal descriptions in complex real-world
environments.

Abstract: This paper introduces TopoDiffuser, a diffusion-based framework for
multimodal trajectory prediction that incorporates topometric maps to generate
accurate, diverse, and road-compliant future motion forecasts. By embedding
structural cues from topometric maps into the denoising process of a
conditional diffusion model, the proposed approach enables trajectory
generation that naturally adheres to road geometry without relying on explicit
constraints. A multimodal conditioning encoder fuses LiDAR observations,
historical motion, and route information into a unified bird's-eye-view (BEV)
representation. Extensive experiments on the KITTI benchmark demonstrate that
TopoDiffuser outperforms state-of-the-art methods, while maintaining strong
geometric consistency. Ablation studies further validate the contribution of
each input modality, as well as the impact of denoising steps and the number of
trajectory samples. To support future research, we publicly release our code at

Conclusion: Omni-Scan提供了一种高效且高质量的全方位3D建模方法，适用于工业缺陷检测等应用。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splats (3DGSs) are 3D object models derived from multi-view
images. Such "digital twins" are useful for simulations, virtual reality,
marketing, robot policy fine-tuning, and part inspection. 3D object scanning
usually requires multi-camera arrays, precise laser scanners, or robot
wrist-mounted cameras, which have restricted workspaces. We propose Omni-Scan,
a pipeline for producing high-quality 3D Gaussian Splat models using a
bi-manual robot that grasps an object with one gripper and rotates the object
with respect to a stationary camera. The object is then re-grasped by a second
gripper to expose surfaces that were occluded by the first gripper. We present
the Omni-Scan robot pipeline using DepthAny-thing, Segment Anything, as well as
RAFT optical flow models to identify and isolate objects held by a robot
gripper while removing the gripper and the background. We then modify the 3DGS
training pipeline to support concatenated datasets with gripper occlusion,
producing an omni-directional (360 degree view) model of the object. We apply
Omni-Scan to part defect inspection, finding that it can identify visual or
geometric defects in 12 different industrial and household objects with an
average accuracy of 83%. Interactive videos of Omni-Scan 3DGS models can be

Conclusion: TOP方法有效解决了上半身快速动作对平衡的干扰问题，提升了整体控制性能。

Abstract: Humanoid robots have the potential capability to perform a diverse range of
manipulation tasks, but this is based on a robust and precise standing
controller. Existing methods are either ill-suited to precisely control
high-dimensional upper-body joints, or difficult to ensure both robustness and
accuracy, especially when upper-body motions are fast. This paper proposes a
novel time optimization policy (TOP), to train a standing manipulation control
model that ensures balance, precision, and time efficiency simultaneously, with
the idea of adjusting the time trajectory of upper-body motions but not only
strengthening the disturbance resistance of the lower-body. Our approach
consists of three parts. Firstly, we utilize motion prior to represent
upper-body motions to enhance the coordination ability between the upper and
lower-body by training a variational autoencoder (VAE). Then we decouple the
whole-body control into an upper-body PD controller for precision and a
lower-body RL controller to enhance robust stability. Finally, we train TOP
method in conjunction with the decoupled controller and VAE to reduce the
balance burden resulting from fast upper-body motions that would destabilize
the robot and exceed the capabilities of the lower-body RL policy. The
effectiveness of the proposed approach is evaluated via both simulation and
real world experiments, which demonstrate the superiority on standing
manipulation tasks stably and accurately. The project page can be found at

Abstract: Motion imitation is a pivotal and effective approach for humanoid robots to
achieve a more diverse range of complex and expressive movements, making their
performances more human-like. However, the significant differences in
kinematics and dynamics between humanoid robots and humans present a major
challenge in accurately imitating motion while maintaining balance. In this
paper, we propose a novel whole-body motion imitation framework for a full-size
humanoid robot. The proposed method employs contact-aware whole-body motion
retargeting to mimic human motion and provide initial values for reference
trajectories, and the non-linear centroidal model predictive controller ensures
the motion accuracy while maintaining balance and overcoming external
disturbances in real time. The assistance of the whole-body controller allows
for more precise torque control. Experiments have been conducted to imitate a
variety of human motions both in simulation and in a real-world humanoid robot.
These experiments demonstrate the capability of performing with accuracy and
adaptability, which validates the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: The rapid iteration of autonomous vehicle (AV) deployments leads to
increasing needs for building realistic and scalable multi-agent traffic
simulators for efficient evaluation. Recent advances in this area focus on
closed-loop simulators that enable generating diverse and interactive
scenarios. This paper introduces Neural Interactive Agents (NIVA), a
probabilistic framework for multi-agent simulation driven by a hierarchical
Bayesian model that enables closed-loop, observation-conditioned simulation
through autoregressive sampling from a latent, finite mixture of Gaussian
distributions. We demonstrate how NIVA unifies preexisting sequence-to-sequence
trajectory prediction models and emerging closed-loop simulation models trained
on Next-token Prediction (NTP) from a Bayesian inference perspective.
Experiments on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset demonstrate that NIVA attains

Motivation: 现有群体决策方法需要所有机器人参与，资源消耗大且无法分配机器人执行其他任务。

Method: 动态构建子集，仅依赖局部信息，自适应调整子集规模以适应决策难度。

Result: 模拟实验显示，SubCDM在减少机器人数量的同时，决策准确性接近全群体参与。

Conclusion: SubCDM是一种资源高效的群体决策解决方案。

Abstract: Collective decision-making is a key function of autonomous robot swarms,
enabling them to reach a consensus on actions based on environmental features.
Existing strategies require the participation of all robots in the
decision-making process, which is resource-intensive and prevents the swarm
from allocating the robots to any other tasks. We propose Subset-Based
Collective Decision-Making (SubCDM), which enables decisions using only a swarm
subset. The construction of the subset is dynamic and decentralized, relying
solely on local information. Our method allows the swarm to adaptively
determine the size of the subset for accurate decision-making, depending on the
difficulty of reaching a consensus. Simulation results using one hundred robots
show that our approach achieves accuracy comparable to using the entire swarm
while reducing the number of robots required to perform collective
decision-making, making it a resource-efficient solution for collective
decision-making in swarm robotics.

Abstract: Recent advancements in control of prosthetic hands have focused on increasing
autonomy through the use of cameras and other sensory inputs. These systems aim
to reduce the cognitive load on the user by automatically controlling certain
degrees of freedom. In robotics, imitation learning has emerged as a promising
approach for learning grasping and complex manipulation tasks while simplifying
data collection. Its application to the control of prosthetic hands remains,
however, largely unexplored. Bridging this gap could enhance dexterity
restoration and enable prosthetic devices to operate in more unconstrained
scenarios, where tasks are learned from demonstrations rather than relying on
manually annotated sequences. To this end, we present HannesImitationPolicy, an
imitation learning-based method to control the Hannes prosthetic hand, enabling
object grasping in unstructured environments. Moreover, we introduce the
HannesImitationDataset comprising grasping demonstrations in table, shelf, and
human-to-prosthesis handover scenarios. We leverage such data to train a single
diffusion policy and deploy it on the prosthetic hand to predict the wrist
orientation and hand closure for grasping. Experimental evaluation demonstrates
successful grasps across diverse objects and conditions. Finally, we show that
the policy outperforms a segmentation-based visual servo controller in
unstructured scenarios. Additional material is provided on our project page:

Abstract: Robot navigation in unstructured environments requires multimodal perception
systems that can support safe navigation. Multimodality enables the integration
of complementary information collected by different sensors. However, this
information must be processed by machine learning algorithms specifically
designed to leverage heterogeneous data. Furthermore, it is necessary to
identify which sensor modalities are most informative for navigation in the
target environment. In Martian exploration, thermal imagery has proven valuable
for assessing terrain safety due to differences in thermal behaviour between
soil types. This work presents OmniUnet, a transformer-based neural network
architecture for semantic segmentation using RGB, depth, and thermal (RGB-D-T)
imagery. A custom multimodal sensor housing was developed using 3D printing and
mounted on the Martian Rover Testbed for Autonomy (MaRTA) to collect a
multimodal dataset in the Bardenas semi-desert in northern Spain. This location
serves as a representative environment of the Martian surface, featuring
terrain types such as sand, bedrock, and compact soil. A subset of this dataset
was manually labeled to support supervised training of the network. The model
was evaluated both quantitatively and qualitatively, achieving a pixel accuracy
of 80.37% and demonstrating strong performance in segmenting complex
unstructured terrain. Inference tests yielded an average prediction time of 673
ms on a resource-constrained computer (Jetson Orin Nano), confirming its
suitability for on-robot deployment. The software implementation of the network
and the labeled dataset have been made publicly available to support future
research in multimodal terrain perception for planetary robotics.

Abstract: In this work, a control scheme for human-robot collaborative object
transportation is proposed, considering a quadruped robot equipped with the
MIGHTY suction cup that serves both as a gripper for holding the object and a
force/torque sensor. The proposed control scheme is based on the notion of
admittance control, and incorporates a variable damping term aiming towards
increasing the controllability of the human and, at the same time, decreasing
her/his effort. Furthermore, to ensure that the object is not detached from the
suction cup during the collaboration, an additional control signal is proposed,
which is based on a barrier artificial potential. The proposed control scheme
is proven to be passive and its performance is demonstrated through
experimental evaluations conducted using the Unitree Go1 robot equipped with
the MIGHTY suction cup.

Abstract: Recent work has shown that exoskeletons controlled through data-driven
methods can dynamically adapt assistance to various tasks for healthy young
adults. However, applying these methods to populations with neuromotor gait
deficits, such as post-stroke hemiparesis, is challenging. This is due not only
to high population heterogeneity and gait variability but also to a lack of
post-stroke gait datasets to train accurate models. Despite these challenges,
data-driven methods offer a promising avenue for control, potentially allowing
exoskeletons to function safely and effectively in unstructured community
settings. This work presents a first step towards enabling adaptive
plantarflexion and dorsiflexion assistance from data-driven torque estimation
during post-stroke walking. We trained a multi-task Temporal Convolutional
Network (TCN) using collected data from four post-stroke participants walking
on a treadmill ($R^2$ of $0.74 \pm 0.13$). The model uses data from three
inertial measurement units (IMU) and was pretrained on healthy walking data
from 6 participants. We implemented a wearable prototype for our ankle torque
estimation approach for exoskeleton control and demonstrated the viability of
real-time sensing, estimation, and actuation with one post-stroke participant.

TL;DR: LightDP是一种专为移动设备设计的框架，通过压缩去噪模块和减少采样步骤，加速Diffusion Policies在资源受限环境中的实时部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion Policies在机器人操作任务中表现出色，但在资源受限的移动平台上因计算和内存问题难以应用。

Method: LightDP采用网络压缩和采样步骤减少策略，通过统一的剪枝和再训练流程优化模型，并结合一致性蒸馏技术。

Result: 实验表明，LightDP在移动设备上实现实时动作预测，性能与现有Diffusion Policies相当。

Conclusion: LightDP为资源受限环境中部署Diffusion Policies提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion Policies have significantly advanced robotic manipulation tasks via
imitation learning, but their application on resource-constrained mobile
platforms remains challenging due to computational inefficiency and extensive
memory footprint. In this paper, we propose LightDP, a novel framework
specifically designed to accelerate Diffusion Policies for real-time deployment
on mobile devices. LightDP addresses the computational bottleneck through two
core strategies: network compression of the denoising modules and reduction of
the required sampling steps. We first conduct an extensive computational
analysis on existing Diffusion Policy architectures, identifying the denoising
network as the primary contributor to latency. To overcome performance
degradation typically associated with conventional pruning methods, we
introduce a unified pruning and retraining pipeline, optimizing the model's
post-pruning recoverability explicitly. Furthermore, we combine pruning
techniques with consistency distillation to effectively reduce sampling steps
while maintaining action prediction accuracy. Experimental evaluations on the
standard datasets, \ie, PushT, Robomimic, CALVIN, and LIBERO, demonstrate that
LightDP achieves real-time action prediction on mobile devices with competitive
performance, marking an important step toward practical deployment of
diffusion-based policies in resource-limited environments. Extensive real-world
experiments also show the proposed LightDP can achieve performance comparable
to state-of-the-art Diffusion Policies.

Result: 在少量演示数据下提取策略，显著提升鲁棒性和样本效率，泛化能力强。

Conclusion: 视频生成模型优于传统行为克隆，为机器人策略学习提供更高效方案。

Abstract: Despite tremendous progress in dexterous manipulation, current visuomotor
policies remain fundamentally limited by two challenges: they struggle to
generalize under perceptual or behavioral distribution shifts, and their
performance is constrained by the size of human demonstration data. In this
paper, we use video generation as a proxy for robot policy learning to address
both limitations simultaneously. We propose Video Policy, a modular framework
that combines video and action generation that can be trained end-to-end. Our
results demonstrate that learning to generate videos of robot behavior allows
for the extraction of policies with minimal demonstration data, significantly
improving robustness and sample efficiency. Our method shows strong
generalization to unseen objects, backgrounds, and tasks, both in simulation
and the real world. We further highlight that task success is closely tied to
the generated video, with action-free video data providing critical benefits
for generalizing to novel tasks. By leveraging large-scale video generative
models, we achieve superior performance compared to traditional behavior
cloning, paving the way for more scalable and data-efficient robot policy
learning.
