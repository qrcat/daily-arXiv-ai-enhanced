Abstract: Masked Face Recognition (MFR) is an increasingly important area in biometric
recognition technologies, especially with the widespread use of masks as a
result of the COVID-19 pandemic. This development has created new challenges
for facial recognition systems due to the partial concealment of basic facial
features. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of the latest
developments in the field, with a focus on deep learning techniques, especially
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and twin networks (Siamese networks),
which have played a pivotal role in improving the accuracy of covering face
recognition. The paper discusses the most prominent challenges, which include
changes in lighting, different facial positions, partial concealment, and the
impact of mask types on the performance of systems. It also reviews advanced
technologies developed to overcome these challenges, including data enhancement
using artificial databases and multimedia methods to improve the ability of
systems to generalize. In addition, the paper highlights advance in deep
network design, feature extraction techniques, evaluation criteria, and data
sets used in this area. Moreover, it reviews the various applications of masked
face recognition in the fields of security and medicine, highlighting the
growing importance of these systems in light of recurrent health crises and
increasing security threats. Finally, the paper focuses on future research

### [3] [HoneyImage: Verifiable, Harmless, and Stealthy Dataset Ownership Verification for Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00892)
*Zhihao Zhu,Jiale Han,Yi Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HoneyImage是一种用于图像识别模型的数据集所有权验证新方法，通过选择性修改少量困难样本嵌入可验证痕迹，实现高效验证且不影响数据完整性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像数据集常包含敏感或专有内容，现有验证方法在效果和数据完整性之间存在权衡，需要更可靠的机制。

Method: HoneyImage选择性修改少量困难样本，嵌入不可察觉但可验证的痕迹。

Result: 在多个基准数据集和模型架构上，HoneyImage验证准确率高，对下游性能影响极小。

Conclusion: HoneyImage为数据所有者提供了一种实用的所有权保护机制，促进数据安全共享。

Abstract: Image-based AI models are increasingly deployed across a wide range of
domains, including healthcare, security, and consumer applications. However,
many image datasets carry sensitive or proprietary content, raising critical
concerns about unauthorized data usage. Data owners therefore need reliable
mechanisms to verify whether their proprietary data has been misused to train
third-party models. Existing solutions, such as backdoor watermarking and
membership inference, face inherent trade-offs between verification
effectiveness and preservation of data integrity. In this work, we propose
HoneyImage, a novel method for dataset ownership verification in image
recognition models. HoneyImage selectively modifies a small number of hard
samples to embed imperceptible yet verifiable traces, enabling reliable
ownership verification while maintaining dataset integrity. Extensive
experiments across four benchmark datasets and multiple model architectures
show that HoneyImage consistently achieves strong verification accuracy with
minimal impact on downstream performance while maintaining imperceptible. The
proposed HoneyImage method could provide data owners with a practical mechanism
to protect ownership over valuable image datasets, encouraging safe sharing and
unlocking the full transformative potential of data-driven AI.

### [4] [Phase-fraction guided denoising diffusion model for augmenting multiphase steel microstructure segmentation via micrograph image-mask pair synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00896)
*Hoang Hai Nam Nguyen,Minh Tien Tran,Hoheok Kim,Ho Won Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PF-DiffSeg是一种基于相位分数控制的单阶段去噪扩散框架，用于联合生成微观结构图像和分割掩码，显著提高了分割精度，尤其在少数类别中表现突出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金属合金中稀有或复杂形态的微观结构缺乏人工标注的相位掩码，限制了机器学习在微观结构分割中的效果。

Method: 通过全局相位分数向量控制，增强真实数据分布并强调少数类别，模型生成结构一致且成分有效的微观结构图像和掩码样本。

Result: 在MetalDAM基准测试中，该方法显著提高了分割精度，尤其在少数类别中优于传统增强策略和两阶段生成方法，同时减少了推理时间。

Conclusion: PF-DiffSeg将生成和条件控制集成到统一框架中，为金相应用中的数据增强提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: The effectiveness of machine learning in metallographic microstructure
segmentation is often constrained by the lack of human-annotated phase masks,
particularly for rare or compositionally complex morphologies within the metal
alloy. We introduce PF-DiffSeg, a phase-fraction controlled, one-stage
denoising diffusion framework that jointly synthesizes microstructure images
and their corresponding segmentation masks in a single generative trajectory to
further improve segmentation accuracy. By conditioning on global phase-fraction
vectors, augmented to represent real data distribution and emphasize minority
classes, our model generates compositionally valid and structurally coherent
microstructure image and mask samples that improve both data diversity and
training efficiency. Evaluated on the MetalDAM benchmark for additively
manufactured multiphase steel, our synthetic augmentation method yields notable
improvements in segmentation accuracy compared to standard augmentation
strategies especially in minority classes and further outperforms a two-stage
mask-guided diffusion and generative adversarial network (GAN) baselines, while
also reducing inference time compared to conventional approach. The method
integrates generation and conditioning into a unified framework, offering a
scalable solution for data augmentation in metallographic applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文探讨了结合自编码器和RNN、3D CNN等架构的混合深度学习方法在视频帧预测中的应用，结果表明3D CNN和ConvLSTM的混合模型效果最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频帧预测在天气预报和自动驾驶等领域有重要应用，但现有模型仍有改进空间。

Method: 采用自编码器提取特征，结合RNN、3D CNN等架构进行时序建模，并在不同数据集上评估。

Result: SSIM指标从0.69提升至0.82，3D CNN和ConvLSTM的混合模型表现最佳，灰度视频预测效果最好。

Conclusion: 混合深度学习方法在视频帧预测中表现优异，尤其是3D CNN和ConvLSTM的组合。

Abstract: In recent years, advances in Artificial Intelligence have significantly
impacted computer science, particularly in the field of computer vision,
enabling solutions to complex problems such as video frame prediction. Video
frame prediction has critical applications in weather forecasting or autonomous
systems and can provide technical improvements, such as video compression and
streaming. Among Artificial Intelligence methods, Deep Learning has emerged as
highly effective for solving vision-related tasks, although current frame
prediction models still have room for enhancement. This paper evaluates several
hybrid deep learning approaches that combine the feature extraction
capabilities of autoencoders with temporal sequence modelling using Recurrent
Neural Networks (RNNs), 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (3D CNNs), and related
architectures. The proposed solutions were rigorously evaluated on three
datasets that differ in terms of synthetic versus real-world scenarios and
grayscale versus color imagery. Results demonstrate that the approaches perform
well, with SSIM metrics increasing from 0.69 to 0.82, indicating that hybrid
models utilizing 3DCNNs and ConvLSTMs are the most effective, and greyscale
videos with real data are the easiest to predict.

### [6] [TESPEC: Temporally-Enhanced Self-Supervised Pretraining for Event Cameras](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00913)
*Mohammad Mohammadi,Ziyi Wu,Igor Gilitschenski*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TESPEC是一个自监督预训练框架，专为学习事件数据的时空信息设计，特别适合循环模型，通过长事件序列预训练提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自监督学习方法忽略事件数据的长期时间信息，限制了循环模型的潜力。

Method: TESPEC采用掩码图像建模范式，设计新重建目标，将事件累积为伪灰度视频，减少噪声和运动模糊。

Result: 在目标检测、语义分割和深度估计等下游任务中取得领先结果。

Conclusion: TESPEC是首个利用长事件序列预训练的框架，显著提升循环模型性能。

Abstract: Long-term temporal information is crucial for event-based perception tasks,
as raw events only encode pixel brightness changes. Recent works show that when
trained from scratch, recurrent models achieve better results than feedforward
models in these tasks. However, when leveraging self-supervised pre-trained
weights, feedforward models can outperform their recurrent counterparts.
Current self-supervised learning (SSL) methods for event-based pre-training
largely mimic RGB image-based approaches. They pre-train feedforward models on
raw events within a short time interval, ignoring the temporal information of
events. In this work, we introduce TESPEC, a self-supervised pre-training
framework tailored for learning spatio-temporal information. TESPEC is
well-suited for recurrent models, as it is the first framework to leverage long
event sequences during pre-training. TESPEC employs the masked image modeling
paradigm with a new reconstruction target. We design a novel method to
accumulate events into pseudo grayscale videos containing high-level semantic
information about the underlying scene, which is robust to sensor noise and
reduces motion blur. Reconstructing this target thus requires the model to
reason about long-term history of events. Extensive experiments demonstrate our
state-of-the-art results in downstream tasks, including object detection,
semantic segmentation, and monocular depth estimation. Project webpage:

Method: 使用Flux.1 Kontext Dev管道和Facezoom LoRA适应，对7种退化类型（如压缩伪影、模糊和噪声）进行测试。

Result: 识别准确率显著提升55.4个百分点，所有退化类型均表现出显著性能增益。

Conclusion: 基于扩散的增强技术在法医人脸识别中具有重要应用潜力。

Abstract: Face recognition systems experience severe performance degradation when
processing low-quality forensic evidence imagery. This paper presents an
evaluation of latent diffusion-based enhancement for improving face recognition
under forensically relevant degradations. Using a dataset of 3,000 individuals
from LFW with 24,000 recognition attempts, we implement the Flux.1 Kontext Dev
pipeline with Facezoom LoRA adaptation to test against seven degradation
categories, including compression artefacts, blur effects, and noise
contamination. Our approach demonstrates substantial improvements, increasing
overall recognition accuracy from 29.1% to 84.5% (55.4 percentage point
improvement, 95% CI: [54.1, 56.7]). Statistical analysis reveals significant
performance gains across all degradation types, with effect sizes exceeding
conventional thresholds for practical significance. These findings establish
the potential of sophisticated diffusion based enhancement in forensic face
recognition applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出CCRA方法，通过LPWCA和PAI协调跨模态注意力机制，提升视觉语言模型的性能和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在跨模态嵌入学习中难以协调多样注意力机制，导致注意力不匹配和性能不佳。

Method: 提出CCRA方法，包括LPWCA（层-块交叉注意力）和PAI（渐进注意力集成），协调多种注意力机制。

Result: 在十个基准测试中，CCRA增强的LLaVA-v1.5-7B模型表现最优，仅增加3.55M参数。

Conclusion: CCRA通过区域聚焦和语义对齐的注意力模式，显著提升了模型性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) face challenges in effectively coordinating
diverse attention mechanisms for cross-modal embedding learning, leading to
mismatched attention and suboptimal performance. We propose Consistent
Cross-layer Regional Alignment (CCRA), which introduces Layer-Patch-wise Cross
Attention (LPWCA) to capture fine-grained regional-semantic correlations by
jointly weighting patch and layer-wise embedding, and Progressive Attention
Integration (PAI) that systematically coordinates LPWCA, layer-wise, and
patch-wise attention mechanisms in sequence. This progressive design ensures
consistency from semantic to regional levels while preventing attention drift
and maximizing individual attention benefits. Experimental results on ten
diverse vision-language benchmarks demonstrate that our CCRA-enhanced
LLaVA-v1.5-7B model achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming all
baseline methods with only 3.55M additional parameters, while providing
enhanced interpretability through more regionally focused and semantically
aligned attention patterns.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在将基于跑步机的自动标注方法扩展到自行车运动场景，以提升红外热成像技术在运动医学中的应用效果。

Method: 采用自动标注和高质量手动标注结合的方法，训练语义分割网络，并在不同数据集组合中进行比较。

Result: 结果表明，少量手动标注数据的微调足以显著提升深度学习网络的性能。

Conclusion: 自动标注与少量手动标注数据的结合，能加速深度学习网络在新场景（如跑步机到自行车）中的适应。

Abstract: Infrared thermography is emerging as a powerful tool in sports medicine,
allowing assessment of thermal radiation during exercise and analysis of
anatomical regions of interest, such as the well-exposed calves. Building on
our previous advanced automatic annotation method, we aimed to transfer the
stereo- and multimodal-based labeling approach from treadmill running to
ergometer cycling. Therefore, the training of the semantic segmentation network
with automatic labels and fine-tuning on high-quality manually annotated images
has been examined and compared in different data set combinations. The results
indicate that fine-tuning with a small fraction of manual data is sufficient to
improve the overall performance of the deep neural network. Finally, combining
automatically generated labels with small manually annotated data sets
accelerates the adaptation of deep neural networks to new use cases, such as
the transition from treadmill to bicycle.

*Cihang Peng,Qiming Hou,Zhong Ren,Kun Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ROVI是一个高质量合成数据集，用于实例接地文本到图像生成，通过重新标注策略提升检测效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有检测数据集在图像质量、分辨率和类别数量上的不足，同时捕捉人类常忽略的次要视觉元素。

Method: 采用重新标注策略，结合VLM和LLM生成全面视觉描述，提取类别供OVDs检测。

Result: ROVI在图像质量、分辨率和类别数量上优于现有数据集，GLIGEN模型在实例接地准确性、提示保真度和美学质量上表现优异。

Conclusion: ROVI为文本到图像生成提供了高质量数据集和可复现流程，显著提升性能。

Abstract: We present ROVI, a high-quality synthetic dataset for instance-grounded
text-to-image generation, created by labeling 1M curated web images. Our key
innovation is a strategy called re-captioning, focusing on the pre-detection
stage, where a VLM (Vision-Language Model) generates comprehensive visual
descriptions that are then processed by an LLM (Large Language Model) to
extract a flat list of potential categories for OVDs (Open-Vocabulary
Detectors) to detect. This approach yields a global prompt inherently linked to
instance annotations while capturing secondary visual elements humans typically
overlook. Evaluations show that ROVI exceeds existing detection datasets in
image quality and resolution while containing two orders of magnitude more
categories with an open-vocabulary nature. For demonstrative purposes, a
text-to-image model GLIGEN trained on ROVI significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art alternatives in instance grounding accuracy, prompt fidelity,
and aesthetic quality. Our dataset and reproducible pipeline are available at
https://github.com/CihangPeng/ROVI.

### [11] [AutoSIGHT: Automatic Eye Tracking-based System for Immediate Grading of Human experTise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01015)
*Byron Dowling,Jozef Probcin,Adam Czajka*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AutoSIGHT系统通过眼动追踪数据自动评估人类在视觉任务中的专业水平，5秒评估窗口下AUROC为0.751，30秒窗口下提升至0.8306。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何通过眼动追踪数据自动区分专家与非专家，为动态调整人机协作中的专业权重提供基础。

Method: 基于眼动追踪数据提取特征，构建AutoSIGHT系统进行分类。

Result: 5秒评估窗口AUROC为0.751，30秒窗口提升至0.8306。

Conclusion: AutoSIGHT验证了通过眼动数据评估人类专业水平的可行性，为人机协作动态调整提供新思路。

Abstract: Can we teach machines to assess the expertise of humans solving visual tasks
automatically based on eye tracking features? This paper proposes AutoSIGHT,
Automatic System for Immediate Grading of Human experTise, that classifies
expert and non-expert performers, and builds upon an ensemble of features
extracted from eye tracking data while the performers were solving a visual
task. Results on the task of iris Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) used for
this study show that with a small evaluation window of just 5 seconds,
AutoSIGHT achieves an average average Area Under the ROC curve performance of
0.751 in subject-disjoint train-test regime, indicating that such detection is
viable. Furthermore, when a larger evaluation window of up to 30 seconds is
available, the Area Under the ROC curve (AUROC) increases to 0.8306, indicating
the model is effectively leveraging more information at a cost of slightly
delayed decisions. This work opens new areas of research on how to incorporate
the automatic weighing of human and machine expertise into human-AI pairing
setups, which need to react dynamically to nonstationary expertise distribution
between the human and AI players (e.g. when the experts need to be replaced, or
the task at hand changes rapidly). Along with this paper, we offer the eye
tracking data used in this study collected from 6 experts and 53 non-experts
solving iris PAD visual task.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种增量式SfM方法，用于稀疏或部分重叠数据集的3D重建，通过几何估计一致性和迭代优化提升重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决全局SfM方法对噪声或数据缺失敏感的问题，提供更灵活的3D重建方案。

Method: 详细实现增量式SfM流程，结合几何估计一致性和束调整迭代优化。

Result: 在真实数据集上验证，通过重投影误差和相机轨迹一致性评估重建质量。

Conclusion: 增量式SfM是视觉结构化环境中稀疏3D重建的可靠方法。

Abstract: Accurate 3D reconstruction from unstructured image collections is a key
requirement in applications such as robotics, mapping, and scene understanding.
While global Structure from Motion (SfM) techniques rely on full image
connectivity and can be sensitive to noise or missing data, incremental SfM
offers a more flexible alternative. By progressively incorporating new views
into the reconstruction, it enables the system to recover scene structure and
camera motion even in sparse or partially overlapping datasets. In this paper,
we present a detailed implementation of the incremental SfM pipeline, focusing
on the consistency of geometric estimation and the effect of iterative
refinement through bundle adjustment. We demonstrate the approach using a real
dataset and assess reconstruction quality through reprojection error and camera
trajectory coherence. The results support the practical utility of incremental
SfM as a reliable method for sparse 3D reconstruction in visually structured
environments.

*Theo Di Piazza,Carole Lazarus,Olivier Nempont,Loic Boussel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于图的新方法，用于多标签分类3D CT扫描，解决了现有方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着CT扫描检查的增加，需要自动化方法辅助放射科医生管理工作量。多标签分类因复杂空间关系和异常多样性而具挑战性。

Method: 将CT扫描建模为结构化图，利用轴向切片三元组节点和谱域卷积提升分类性能。

Result: 方法表现出强跨数据集泛化能力、竞争力性能及对z轴平移的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 通过消融研究验证了各组件贡献，证明了方法的有效性。

Abstract: With the increasing number of CT scan examinations, there is a need for
automated methods such as organ segmentation, anomaly detection and report
generation to assist radiologists in managing their increasing workload.
Multi-label classification of 3D CT scans remains a critical yet challenging
task due to the complex spatial relationships within volumetric data and the
variety of observed anomalies. Existing approaches based on 3D convolutional
networks have limited abilities to model long-range dependencies while Vision
Transformers suffer from high computational costs and often require extensive
pre-training on large-scale datasets from the same domain to achieve
competitive performance. In this work, we propose an alternative by introducing
a new graph-based approach that models CT scans as structured graphs,
leveraging axial slice triplets nodes processed through spectral domain
convolution to enhance multi-label anomaly classification performance. Our
method exhibits strong cross-dataset generalization, and competitive
performance while achieving robustness to z-axis translation. An ablation study
evaluates the contribution of each proposed component.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种统一的规避框架，通过教师模型学习版权数据集，并利用OOD数据集将任务相关但标识无关的知识转移给学生模型，显著优于现有规避攻击方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集所有权验证（DOV）方法依赖过于简化的规避攻击评估，导致虚假的安全感，需要更实际的评估框架。

Method: 使用教师模型学习版权数据集，通过OOD数据集转移任务相关但标识无关的知识，结合视觉语言模型和大型语言模型筛选最优转移集。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能消除所有版权标识，并在泛化性和有效性上显著优于九种现有规避攻击方法。

Conclusion: 揭示了当前DOV方法的关键漏洞，强调需要长期发展以提升实用性。

Abstract: Modern over-parameterized deep models are highly data-dependent, with large
scale general-purpose and domain-specific datasets serving as the bedrock for
rapid advancements. However, many datasets are proprietary or contain sensitive
information, making unrestricted model training problematic. In the open world
where data thefts cannot be fully prevented, Dataset Ownership Verification
(DOV) has emerged as a promising method to protect copyright by detecting
unauthorized model training and tracing illicit activities. Due to its
diversity and superior stealth, evading DOV is considered extremely
challenging. However, this paper identifies that previous studies have relied
on oversimplistic evasion attacks for evaluation, leading to a false sense of
security. We introduce a unified evasion framework, in which a teacher model
first learns from the copyright dataset and then transfers task-relevant yet
identifier-independent domain knowledge to a surrogate student using an
out-of-distribution (OOD) dataset as the intermediary. Leveraging
Vision-Language Models and Large Language Models, we curate the most
informative and reliable subsets from the OOD gallery set as the final transfer
set, and propose selectively transferring task-oriented knowledge to achieve a
better trade-off between generalization and evasion effectiveness. Experiments
across diverse datasets covering eleven DOV methods demonstrate our approach
simultaneously eliminates all copyright identifiers and significantly
outperforms nine state-of-the-art evasion attacks in both generalization and
effectiveness, with moderate computational overhead. As a proof of concept, we
reveal key vulnerabilities in current DOV methods, highlighting the need for
long-term development to enhance practicality.

Abstract: To enhance asteroid exploration and autonomous spacecraft navigation, we
introduce DreamSat-2.0, a pipeline that benchmarks three state-of-the-art 3D
reconstruction models-Hunyuan-3D, Trellis-3D, and Ouroboros-3D-on custom
spacecraft and asteroid datasets. Our systematic analysis, using 2D perceptual
(image quality) and 3D geometric (shape accuracy) metrics, reveals that model
performance is domain-dependent. While models produce higher-quality images of
complex spacecraft, they achieve better geometric reconstructions for the
simpler forms of asteroids. New benchmarks are established, with Hunyuan-3D
achieving top perceptual scores on spacecraft but its best geometric accuracy
on asteroids, marking a significant advance over our prior work.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: COSTARR提出了一种新的衰减假设，利用训练中学习的小权重衰减特征，结合熟悉特征和陌生特征的缺失，显著提升了开放集识别的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开放集识别方法依赖熟悉特征假设，忽略了衰减特征的作用。COSTARR旨在利用这些被忽视的信息。

Method: 提出衰减假设，结合熟悉特征和陌生特征的缺失，设计COSTARR方法，并通过概率解释其评分。

Result: 在多种预训练架构上，COSTARR显著优于现有方法，证明了其泛化能力和性能提升。

Conclusion: COSTARR通过利用衰减信息，推动了开放集识别的发展，并在实验中表现出色。

Abstract: Handling novelty remains a key challenge in visual recognition systems.
Existing open-set recognition (OSR) methods rely on the familiarity hypothesis,
detecting novelty by the absence of familiar features. We propose a novel
attenuation hypothesis: small weights learned during training attenuate
features and serve a dual role-differentiating known classes while discarding
information useful for distinguishing known from unknown classes. To leverage
this overlooked information, we present COSTARR, a novel approach that combines
both the requirement of familiar features and the lack of unfamiliar ones. We
provide a probabilistic interpretation of the COSTARR score, linking it to the
likelihood of correct classification and belonging in a known class. To
determine the individual contributions of the pre- and post-attenuated features
to COSTARR's performance, we conduct ablation studies that show both
pre-attenuated deep features and the underutilized post-attenuated Hadamard
product features are essential for improving OSR. Also, we evaluate COSTARR in
a large-scale setting using ImageNet2012-1K as known data and NINCO,
iNaturalist, OpenImage-O, and other datasets as unknowns, across multiple
modern pre-trained architectures (ViTs, ConvNeXts, and ResNet). The experiments
demonstrate that COSTARR generalizes effectively across various architectures
and significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods by incorporating
previously discarded attenuation information, advancing open-set recognition
capabilities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Trans-Adapter是一种即插即用的适配器，使基于扩散的图像修复模型能够直接处理透明图像，解决了现有方法在透明图像修复中的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像修复方法仅适用于RGB图像，透明图像修复通常需要两阶段处理（修复和抠图），导致透明区域不一致和边缘锯齿问题。

Method: 提出Trans-Adapter适配器，支持ControlNet可控编辑，并可直接集成到多种社区模型中。

Result: 通过LayerBench和新提出的透明度边缘质量评估指标验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: Trans-Adapter解决了透明图像修复的挑战，并展示了良好的性能和兼容性。

Abstract: RGBA images, with the additional alpha channel, are crucial for any
application that needs blending, masking, or transparency effects, making them
more versatile than standard RGB images. Nevertheless, existing image
inpainting methods are designed exclusively for RGB images. Conventional
approaches to transparent image inpainting typically involve placing a
background underneath RGBA images and employing a two-stage process: image
inpainting followed by image matting. This pipeline, however, struggles to
preserve transparency consistency in edited regions, and matting can introduce
jagged edges along transparency boundaries. To address these challenges, we
propose Trans-Adapter, a plug-and-play adapter that enables diffusion-based
inpainting models to process transparent images directly. Trans-Adapter also
supports controllable editing via ControlNet and can be seamlessly integrated
into various community models. To evaluate our method, we introduce LayerBench,
along with a novel non-reference alpha edge quality evaluation metric for
assessing transparency edge quality. We conduct extensive experiments on
LayerBench to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

TL;DR: MASIV是一种基于视觉的材料无关系统识别框架，通过可学习的神经本构模型推断物体动力学，无需依赖预定义的材料先验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖预定义的材料先验，限制了处理未知材料的能力。

Method: MASIV使用可学习的神经本构模型，并通过重建连续粒子轨迹提供密集几何指导。

Result: MASIV在几何精度、渲染质量和泛化能力上达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: MASIV通过材料无关的方法解决了系统识别中的挑战，表现出优越性能。

Abstract: System identification from videos aims to recover object geometry and
governing physical laws. Existing methods integrate differentiable rendering
with simulation but rely on predefined material priors, limiting their ability
to handle unknown ones. We introduce MASIV, the first vision-based framework
for material-agnostic system identification. Unlike existing approaches that
depend on hand-crafted constitutive laws, MASIV employs learnable neural
constitutive models, inferring object dynamics without assuming a
scene-specific material prior. However, the absence of full particle state
information imposes unique challenges, leading to unstable optimization and
physically implausible behaviors. To address this, we introduce dense geometric
guidance by reconstructing continuum particle trajectories, providing
temporally rich motion constraints beyond sparse visual cues. Comprehensive
experiments show that MASIV achieves state-of-the-art performance in geometric
accuracy, rendering quality, and generalization ability.

Result: RL结合多模态LLM验证器效果最佳，EARL模型在多种编辑任务中表现优异，且训练数据需求较少。

Conclusion: EARL推动了自回归多模态模型在图像编辑领域的进展，相关资源已开源。

Abstract: We explore three strategies to enhance performance on a wide range of image
editing tasks: supervised fine-tuning (SFT), reinforcement learning (RL), and
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. In order to study all these components in one
consistent framework, we adopt an autoregressive multimodal model that
processes textual and visual tokens in a unified manner. We find RL combined
with a large multi-modal LLM verifier to be the most effective of these
strategies. As a result, we release EARL: Editing with Autoregression and RL, a
strong RL-based image editing model that performs competitively on a diverse
range of edits compared to strong baselines, despite using much less training
data. Thus, EARL pushes the frontier of autoregressive multimodal models on
image editing. We release our code, training data, and trained models at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了Egocentric Motion Generation和Egocentric Motion Forecasting两个新任务，并开发了UniEgoMotion模型，通过第一人称视角图像实现场景感知的运动合成，无需依赖显式3D场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升AR/VR体验、改善人机交互、推动辅助技术和自适应医疗解决方案，需要从第一人称视角准确预测和模拟运动。现有方法主要基于第三人称视角和结构化3D场景，难以应对真实世界中第一人称视角的局限性。

Method: 提出了UniEgoMotion，一种统一的基于条件运动扩散的模型，采用头部中心运动表示，支持从第一人称视觉输入中重建、预测和生成运动。

Result: UniEgoMotion在egocentric运动重建中达到最先进水平，并首次实现了从单张第一人称图像生成运动。

Conclusion: UniEgoMotion为egocentric运动建模设定了新基准，为相关应用开辟了新可能性。

Abstract: Egocentric human motion generation and forecasting with scene-context is
crucial for enhancing AR/VR experiences, improving human-robot interaction,
advancing assistive technologies, and enabling adaptive healthcare solutions by
accurately predicting and simulating movement from a first-person perspective.
However, existing methods primarily focus on third-person motion synthesis with
structured 3D scene contexts, limiting their effectiveness in real-world
egocentric settings where limited field of view, frequent occlusions, and
dynamic cameras hinder scene perception. To bridge this gap, we introduce
Egocentric Motion Generation and Egocentric Motion Forecasting, two novel tasks
that utilize first-person images for scene-aware motion synthesis without
relying on explicit 3D scene. We propose UniEgoMotion, a unified conditional
motion diffusion model with a novel head-centric motion representation tailored
for egocentric devices. UniEgoMotion's simple yet effective design supports
egocentric motion reconstruction, forecasting, and generation from first-person
visual inputs in a unified framework. Unlike previous works that overlook scene
semantics, our model effectively extracts image-based scene context to infer
plausible 3D motion. To facilitate training, we introduce EE4D-Motion, a
large-scale dataset derived from EgoExo4D, augmented with pseudo-ground-truth
3D motion annotations. UniEgoMotion achieves state-of-the-art performance in
egocentric motion reconstruction and is the first to generate motion from a
single egocentric image. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of
our unified framework, setting a new benchmark for egocentric motion modeling
and unlocking new possibilities for egocentric applications.

Motivation: 解决大规模数据、过拟合和类别不平衡等问题，专注于脑MRI异常检测。

Method: 结合深度强化学习与特征表示，处理标签稀缺和大规模数据，预处理包括归一化、去颅骨和配准。

Result: 在脑MRI数据集上AUROC达88.7%（像素级）和96.7%（图像级），工业数据集上表现同样优异。

Conclusion: 该方法具有鲁棒性、泛化能力和高效性，适用于实际临床应用。

Abstract: To develop a domain-agnostic, semi-supervised anomaly detection framework
that integrates deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to address challenges such as
large-scale data, overfitting, and class imbalance, focusing on brain MRI
volumes. This retrospective study used publicly available brain MRI datasets
collected between 2005 and 2021. The IXI dataset provided 581 T1-weighted and
578 T2-weighted MRI volumes (from healthy subjects) for training, while the
BraTS 2021 dataset provided 251 volumes for validation and 1000 for testing
(unhealthy subjects with Glioblastomas). Preprocessing included normalization,
skull-stripping, and co-registering to a uniform voxel size. Experiments were
conducted on both T1- and T2-weighted modalities. Additional experiments and
ablation analyses were also carried out on the industrial datasets. The
proposed method integrates DRL with feature representations to handle label
scarcity, large-scale data and overfitting. Statistical analysis was based on
several detection and segmentation metrics including AUROC and Dice score. The
proposed method achieved an AUROC of 88.7% (pixel-level) and 96.7%
(image-level) on brain MRI datasets, outperforming State-of-The-Art (SOTA)
methods. On industrial surface datasets, the model also showed competitive
performance (AUROC = 99.8% pixel-level, 99.3% image-level) on MVTec AD dataset,
indicating strong cross-domain generalization. Studies on anomaly sample size
showed a monotonic increase in AUROC as more anomalies were seen, without
evidence of overfitting or additional computational cost. The domain-agnostic
semi-supervised approach using DRL shows significant promise for MRI anomaly
detection, achieving strong performance on both medical and industrial
datasets. Its robustness, generalizability and efficiency highlight its
potential for real-world clinical applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集压缩方法在性能和保真度之间存在权衡，且存在图像级选择效率低和像素级优化语义失真的问题。颜色作为信息载体和语义单元的作用被忽视。

Method: 提出DC3框架，结合校准选择策略和潜在扩散模型，增强图像颜色多样性而非生成全新图像。

Result: DC3在多个基准测试中优于现有方法，且首次利用预训练扩散模型微调压缩数据集。FID结果验证了其高质量数据集的可行性。

Conclusion: DC3通过颜色补偿显著提升了数据集压缩的效果，为下游任务提供了高质量数据。

Abstract: Dataset condensation always faces a constitutive trade-off: balancing
performance and fidelity under extreme compression. Existing methods struggle
with two bottlenecks: image-level selection methods (Coreset Selection, Dataset
Quantization) suffer from inefficiency condensation, while pixel-level
optimization (Dataset Distillation) introduces semantic distortion due to
over-parameterization. With empirical observations, we find that a critical
problem in dataset condensation is the oversight of color's dual role as an
information carrier and a basic semantic representation unit. We argue that
improving the colorfulness of condensed images is beneficial for representation
learning. Motivated by this, we propose DC3: a Dataset Condensation framework
with Color Compensation. After a calibrated selection strategy, DC3 utilizes
the latent diffusion model to enhance the color diversity of an image rather
than creating a brand-new one. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior
performance and generalization of DC3 that outperforms SOTA methods across
multiple benchmarks. To the best of our knowledge, besides focusing on
downstream tasks, DC3 is the first research to fine-tune pre-trained diffusion
models with condensed datasets. The FID results prove that training networks
with our high-quality datasets is feasible without model collapse or other
degradation issues. Code and generated data will be released soon.

Result: 在3D mIoU上比固定阈值策略提升17%，在3D对象理解和场景重建质量上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: OpenGS-Fusion在语言引导的场景交互中表现出色，代码已开源。

Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D scene understanding have made significant strides
in enabling interaction with scenes using open-vocabulary queries, particularly
for VR/AR and robotic applications. Nevertheless, existing methods are hindered
by rigid offline pipelines and the inability to provide precise 3D object-level
understanding given open-ended queries. In this paper, we present
OpenGS-Fusion, an innovative open-vocabulary dense mapping framework that
improves semantic modeling and refines object-level understanding.
OpenGS-Fusion combines 3D Gaussian representation with a Truncated Signed
Distance Field to facilitate lossless fusion of semantic features on-the-fly.
Furthermore, we introduce a novel multimodal language-guided approach named
MLLM-Assisted Adaptive Thresholding, which refines the segmentation of 3D
objects by adaptively adjusting similarity thresholds, achieving an improvement
17\% in 3D mIoU compared to the fixed threshold strategy. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in 3D object
understanding and scene reconstruction quality, as well as showcasing its
effectiveness in language-guided scene interaction. The code is available at

Motivation: 现有文本到图像扩散模型的安全机制未能考虑用户个性化需求，如年龄、心理健康和个人信仰等因素。

Method: 提出PSA框架，整合用户个性化配置文件，通过交叉注意力机制调整模型行为，保持图像质量。

Result: PSA在有害内容抑制和用户约束对齐方面表现优异，Win Rate和Pass Rate得分更高。

Conclusion: PSA为生成模型提供个性化安全控制，代码、数据和模型已公开。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have revolutionized visual content generation,
but current safety mechanisms apply uniform standards that often fail to
account for individual user preferences. These models overlook the diverse
safety boundaries shaped by factors like age, mental health, and personal
beliefs. To address this, we propose Personalized Safety Alignment (PSA), a
framework that allows user-specific control over safety behaviors in generative
models. PSA integrates personalized user profiles into the diffusion process,
adjusting the model's behavior to match individual safety preferences while
preserving image quality. We introduce a new dataset, Sage, which captures
user-specific safety preferences and incorporates these profiles through a
cross-attention mechanism. Experiments show that PSA outperforms existing
methods in harmful content suppression and aligns generated content better with
user constraints, achieving higher Win Rate and Pass Rate scores. Our code,
data, and models are publicly available at

Motivation: 解决现有二分图像分割方法在用户控制和个性化应用中的不足。

Method: 结合语言控制的初始分割（LS）和窗口控制的细化（WR）策略，通过潜在扩散模型生成高质量掩码。

Result: 在DIS5K基准测试中显著优于11种先进方法，Fβω提升4.6%。

Conclusion: LawDIS框架在用户控制和分割精度上表现优异，适用于个性化应用。

Abstract: We present LawDIS, a language-window-based controllable dichotomous image
segmentation (DIS) framework that produces high-quality object masks. Our
framework recasts DIS as an image-conditioned mask generation task within a
latent diffusion model, enabling seamless integration of user controls. LawDIS
is enhanced with macro-to-micro control modes. Specifically, in macro mode, we
introduce a language-controlled segmentation strategy (LS) to generate an
initial mask based on user-provided language prompts. In micro mode, a
window-controlled refinement strategy (WR) allows flexible refinement of
user-defined regions (i.e., size-adjustable windows) within the initial mask.
Coordinated by a mode switcher, these modes can operate independently or
jointly, making the framework well-suited for high-accuracy, personalised
applications. Extensive experiments on the DIS5K benchmark reveal that our
LawDIS significantly outperforms 11 cutting-edge methods across all metrics.
Notably, compared to the second-best model MVANet, we achieve $F_\beta^\omega$
gains of 4.6\% with both the LS and WR strategies and 3.6\% gains with only the
LS strategy on DIS-TE. Codes will be made available at

Motivation: 解决场景文本识别中复杂视觉表现和有限语义先验的挑战。

Method: 通过编码目标标签到嵌入空间并应用损失感知掩码，模拟从标签依赖学习到完全视觉识别的课程学习过程。

Result: 在多个公共基准测试中，TEACH训练的模型表现出更高的准确性，尤其在挑战性条件下验证了其鲁棒性和通用性。

Conclusion: TEACH无需外部预训练，无推理开销，模型无关，可无缝集成到现有编码器-解码器框架中。

Abstract: Scene Text Recognition (STR) remains a challenging task due to complex visual
appearances and limited semantic priors. We propose TEACH, a novel training
paradigm that injects ground-truth text into the model as auxiliary input and
progressively reduces its influence during training. By encoding target labels
into the embedding space and applying loss-aware masking, TEACH simulates a
curriculum learning process that guides the model from label-dependent learning
to fully visual recognition. Unlike language model-based approaches, TEACH
requires no external pretraining and introduces no inference overhead. It is
model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into existing encoder-decoder
frameworks. Extensive experiments across multiple public benchmarks show that
models trained with TEACH achieve consistently improved accuracy, especially
under challenging conditions, validating its robustness and general
applicability.

Result: 算法比现有方法快5-100倍，同时保持最先进的跟踪精度。

Conclusion: 提出的方法显著提升了计算效率，适用于大规模3D点跟踪任务。

Abstract: We propose a novel algorithm for accelerating dense long-term 3D point
tracking in videos. Through analysis of existing state-of-the-art methods, we
identify two major computational bottlenecks. First, transformer-based
iterative tracking becomes expensive when handling a large number of
trajectories. To address this, we introduce a coarse-to-fine strategy that
begins tracking with a small subset of points and progressively expands the set
of tracked trajectories. The newly added trajectories are initialized using a
learnable interpolation module, which is trained end-to-end alongside the
tracking network. Second, we propose an optimization that significantly reduces
the cost of correlation feature computation, another key bottleneck in prior
methods. Together, these improvements lead to a 5-100x speedup over existing
approaches while maintaining state-of-the-art tracking accuracy.

Result: 在无姿态监督下，SPFSplat在新视角合成和相对姿态估计中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: SPFSplat的免姿态训练和高效设计使其适用于实际应用，性能优越。

Abstract: We introduce SPFSplat, an efficient framework for 3D Gaussian splatting from
sparse multi-view images, requiring no ground-truth poses during training or
inference. It employs a shared feature extraction backbone, enabling
simultaneous prediction of 3D Gaussian primitives and camera poses in a
canonical space from unposed inputs within a single feed-forward step.
Alongside the rendering loss based on estimated novel-view poses, a
reprojection loss is integrated to enforce the learning of pixel-aligned
Gaussian primitives for enhanced geometric constraints. This pose-free training
paradigm and efficient one-step feed-forward design make SPFSplat well-suited
for practical applications. Remarkably, despite the absence of pose
supervision, SPFSplat achieves state-of-the-art performance in novel view
synthesis even under significant viewpoint changes and limited image overlap.
It also surpasses recent methods trained with geometry priors in relative pose
estimation. Code and trained models are available on our project page:

Conclusion: 该方法通过联合建模任务依赖关系和动态尺度处理，显著提升了3D功能区域理解的性能。

Abstract: A core problem of Embodied AI is to learn object manipulation from
observation, as humans do. To achieve this, it is important to localize 3D
object affordance areas through observation such as images (3D affordance
grounding) and understand their functionalities (affordance classification).
Previous attempts usually tackle these two tasks separately, leading to
inconsistent predictions due to lacking proper modeling of their dependency. In
addition, these methods typically only ground the incomplete affordance areas
depicted in images, failing to predict the full potential affordance areas, and
operate at a fixed scale, resulting in difficulty in coping with affordances
significantly varying in scale with respect to the whole object. To address
these issues, we propose a novel approach that learns an affordance-aware 3D
representation and employs a stage-wise inference strategy leveraging the
dependency between grounding and classification tasks. Specifically, we first
develop a cross-modal 3D representation through efficient fusion and
multi-scale geometric feature propagation, enabling inference of full potential
affordance areas at a suitable regional scale. Moreover, we adopt a simple
two-stage prediction mechanism, effectively coupling grounding and
classification for better affordance understanding. Experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method, showing improved performance in both affordance
grounding and classification.

Conclusion: 论文提出的方法和数据集为3D视觉定位任务提供了更精确的解决方案。

Abstract: Visual grounding aims to identify objects or regions in a scene based on
natural language descriptions, essential for spatially aware perception in
autonomous driving. However, existing visual grounding tasks typically depend
on bounding boxes that often fail to capture fine-grained details. Not all
voxels within a bounding box are occupied, resulting in inaccurate object
representations. To address this, we introduce a benchmark for 3D occupancy
grounding in challenging outdoor scenes. Built on the nuScenes dataset, it
integrates natural language with voxel-level occupancy annotations, offering
more precise object perception compared to the traditional grounding task.
Moreover, we propose GroundingOcc, an end-to-end model designed for 3D
occupancy grounding through multi-modal learning. It combines visual, textual,
and point cloud features to predict object location and occupancy information
from coarse to fine. Specifically, GroundingOcc comprises a multimodal encoder
for feature extraction, an occupancy head for voxel-wise predictions, and a
grounding head to refine localization. Additionally, a 2D grounding module and
a depth estimation module enhance geometric understanding, thereby boosting
model performance. Extensive experiments on the benchmark demonstrate that our
method outperforms existing baselines on 3D occupancy grounding. The dataset is

Abstract: Civil infrastructure systems covers large land areas and needs frequent
inspections to maintain their public service capabilities. The conventional
approaches of manual surveys or vehicle-based automated surveys to assess
infrastructure conditions are often labor-intensive and time-consuming. For
this reason, it is worthwhile to explore more cost-effective methods for
monitoring and maintaining these infrastructures. Fortunately, recent
advancements in satellite systems and image processing algorithms have opened
up new possibilities. Numerous satellite systems have been employed to monitor
infrastructure conditions and identify damages. Due to the improvement in
ground sample distance (GSD), the level of detail that can be captured has
significantly increased. Taking advantage of these technology advancement, this
research investigated to evaluate pavement conditions using deep learning
models for analyzing satellite images. We gathered over 3,000 satellite images
of pavement sections, together with pavement evaluation ratings from TxDOT's
PMIS database. The results of our study show an accuracy rate is exceeding 90%.
This research paves the way for a rapid and cost-effective approach to
evaluating the pavement network in the future.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为RoadMamba的方法，结合局部和全局感知，用于道路表面分类任务，通过双状态空间模型和双注意力融合实现，并在大规模数据集上取得最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于视觉技术提前获取道路表面条件可为自动驾驶车辆的规划与控制系统提供有效信息，提升安全性和驾驶舒适性。现有的Mamba架构在视觉任务中表现优异，但缺乏对道路表面局部纹理的有效提取。

Method: 提出RoadMamba方法，利用双状态空间模型（DualSSM）提取全局语义和局部纹理，通过双注意力融合（DAF）解码和融合特征，并引入双辅助损失约束网络。

Result: 在包含100万样本的大规模道路表面分类数据集上，RoadMamba取得了最优性能。

Conclusion: RoadMamba通过结合局部和全局感知，有效解决了现有Mamba架构在道路表面分类任务中的不足，实现了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Acquiring the road surface conditions in advance based on visual technologies
provides effective information for the planning and control system of
autonomous vehicles, thus improving the safety and driving comfort of the
vehicles. Recently, the Mamba architecture based on state-space models has
shown remarkable performance in visual processing tasks, benefiting from the
efficient global receptive field. However, existing Mamba architectures
struggle to achieve state-of-the-art visual road surface classification due to
their lack of effective extraction of the local texture of the road surface. In
this paper, we explore for the first time the potential of visual Mamba
architectures for road surface classification task and propose a method that
effectively combines local and global perception, called RoadMamba.
Specifically, we utilize the Dual State Space Model (DualSSM) to effectively
extract the global semantics and local texture of the road surface and decode
and fuse the dual features through the Dual Attention Fusion (DAF). In
addition, we propose a dual auxiliary loss to explicitly constrain dual
branches, preventing the network from relying only on global semantic
information from the deep large receptive field and ignoring the local texture.
The proposed RoadMamba achieves the state-of-the-art performance in experiments
on a large-scale road surface classification dataset containing 1 million
samples.

*Yuanlin Yang,Quanjian Song,Zhexian Gao,Ge Wang,Shanshan Li,Xiaoyan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StyDeco提出了一种无监督框架，通过定制文本表示解决扩散模型在风格转移中的语义丢失问题，表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在风格转移中因将文本描述视为统一指导而忽略了语义与视觉风格的差异，导致细节丢失。

Method: 采用Prior-Guided Data Distillation (PGD)无监督提取风格知识，并通过Contrastive Semantic Decoupling (CSD)任务特定目标优化文本编码器。

Result: 在三个经典基准测试中，StyDeco在风格保真度和结构保留方面优于现有方法，并支持去风格化。

Conclusion: StyDeco有效解决了风格转移中的语义保留问题，具有扩展性。

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as the dominant paradigm for style transfer,
but their text-driven mechanism is hindered by a core limitation: it treats
textual descriptions as uniform, monolithic guidance. This limitation overlooks
the semantic gap between the non-spatial nature of textual descriptions and the
spatially-aware attributes of visual style, often leading to the loss of
semantic structure and fine-grained details during stylization. In this paper,
we propose StyDeco, an unsupervised framework that resolves this limitation by
learning text representations specifically tailored for the style transfer
task. Our framework first employs Prior-Guided Data Distillation (PGD), a
strategy designed to distill stylistic knowledge without human supervision. It
leverages a powerful frozen generative model to automatically synthesize
pseudo-paired data. Subsequently, we introduce Contrastive Semantic Decoupling
(CSD), a task-specific objective that adapts a text encoder using
domain-specific weights. CSD performs a two-class clustering in the semantic
space, encouraging source and target representations to form distinct clusters.
Extensive experiments on three classic benchmarks demonstrate that our
framework outperforms several existing approaches in both stylistic fidelity
and structural preservation, highlighting its effectiveness in style transfer
with semantic preservation. In addition, our framework supports a unique
de-stylization process, further demonstrating its extensibility. Our code is
vailable at https://github.com/QuanjianSong/StyDeco.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用视觉场景上下文信息增强楼层平面定位（FLoc）的方法，通过无监督学习和聚类约束预训练房间判别器，显著提高了定位的鲁棒性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 楼层平面定位因重复结构易导致模糊定位，现有方法忽视视觉图像提供的丰富上下文信息，本文旨在利用场景布局先验消除定位不确定性。

Method: 提出无监督学习技术，通过聚类约束预训练房间判别器，提取隐藏房间类型信息，并将其注入FLoc算法中。

Result: 在两个标准FLoc基准测试中，该方法优于现有技术，显著提升了鲁棒性和准确性。

Conclusion: 利用视觉场景上下文信息可有效增强FLoc算法，消除定位模糊性，提升性能。

Abstract: Since a building's floorplan remains consistent over time and is inherently
robust to changes in visual appearance, visual Floorplan Localization (FLoc)
has received increasing attention from researchers. However, as a compact and
minimalist representation of the building's layout, floorplans contain many
repetitive structures (e.g., hallways and corners), thus easily result in
ambiguous localization. Existing methods either pin their hopes on matching 2D
structural cues in floorplans or rely on 3D geometry-constrained visual
pre-trainings, ignoring the richer contextual information provided by visual
images. In this paper, we suggest using broader visual scene context to empower
FLoc algorithms with scene layout priors to eliminate localization uncertainty.
In particular, we propose an unsupervised learning technique with clustering
constraints to pre-train a room discriminator on self-collected unlabeled room
images. Such a discriminator can empirically extract the hidden room type of
the observed image and distinguish it from other room types. By injecting the
scene context information summarized by the discriminator into an FLoc
algorithm, the room style knowledge is effectively exploited to guide definite
visual FLoc. We conducted sufficient comparative studies on two standard visual
Floc benchmarks. Our experiments show that our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art methods and achieves significant improvements in robustness
and accuracy.

TL;DR: MoGaFace提出了一种新的3D头部虚拟形象建模框架，通过持续优化几何和纹理属性，解决了传统方法中网格与目标图像不对齐的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖FLAME网格和基于高斯的渲染，但网格与图像不对齐导致渲染质量下降和细节丢失。

Method: 引入Momentum-Guided Consistent Geometry模块和Latent Texture Attention，优化几何一致性和纹理细化。

Result: 实验表明，MoGaFace在高质量头部虚拟形象重建和新视角合成方面表现优异。

Conclusion: MoGaFace在网格初始化和真实场景下均能显著提升渲染质量。

Abstract: Existing 3D head avatar reconstruction methods adopt a two-stage process,
relying on tracked FLAME meshes derived from facial landmarks, followed by
Gaussian-based rendering. However, misalignment between the estimated mesh and
target images often leads to suboptimal rendering quality and loss of fine
visual details. In this paper, we present MoGaFace, a novel 3D head avatar
modeling framework that continuously refines facial geometry and texture
attributes throughout the Gaussian rendering process. To address the
misalignment between estimated FLAME meshes and target images, we introduce the
Momentum-Guided Consistent Geometry module, which incorporates a
momentum-updated expression bank and an expression-aware correction mechanism
to ensure temporal and multi-view consistency. Additionally, we propose Latent
Texture Attention, which encodes compact multi-view features into head-aware
representations, enabling geometry-aware texture refinement via integration
into Gaussians. Extensive experiments show that MoGaFace achieves high-fidelity
head avatar reconstruction and significantly improves novel-view synthesis
quality, even under inaccurate mesh initialization and unconstrained real-world
settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Eigen Neural Network (ENN)的新架构，通过重新参数化层的权重为共享的、学习的正交特征基，解决了深度神经网络中权重结构无序的问题，提升了特征表示和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络（DNN）的梯度优化常导致权重结构无序，损害特征清晰度和学习动态。ENN旨在通过结构化的权重表示解决这一问题。

Method: ENN将每层权重重新参数化为层共享、学习的正交特征基，强制权重动态去相关和对齐，无需正则化。此外，还提出了无需反向传播的本地学习变体ENN-ℓ。

Result: ENN在ImageNet等大规模图像分类任务中表现优于现有方法，并在跨模态图像-文本检索中创下新基准。ENN-ℓ实现了2倍以上的训练加速，且精度超过端到端反向传播。

Conclusion: ENN通过结构化权重表示解决了反向传播的表示缺陷，提升了性能并支持高效、可并行化的训练。

Abstract: The remarkable success of Deep Neural Networks(DNN) is driven by
gradient-based optimization, yet this process is often undermined by its
tendency to produce disordered weight structures, which harms feature clarity
and degrades learning dynamics. To address this fundamental representational
flaw, we introduced the Eigen Neural Network (ENN), a novel architecture that
reparameterizes each layer's weights in a layer-shared, learned orthonormal
eigenbasis. This design enforces decorrelated, well-aligned weight dynamics
axiomatically, rather than through regularization, leading to more structured
and discriminative feature representations. When integrated with standard BP,
ENN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on large-scale image
classification benchmarks, including ImageNet, and its superior representations
generalize to set a new benchmark in cross-modal image-text retrieval.
Furthermore, ENN's principled structure enables a highly efficient,
backpropagation-free(BP-free) local learning variant, ENN-$\ell$. This variant
not only resolves BP's procedural bottlenecks to achieve over 2$\times$
training speedup via parallelism, but also, remarkably, surpasses the accuracy
of end-to-end backpropagation. ENN thus presents a new architectural paradigm
that directly remedies the representational deficiencies of BP, leading to
enhanced performance and enabling a more efficient, parallelizable training
regime.

Result: 在多个数据集上匹配或超越标准RevSNNs的准确性，训练时间减少35.2%，推理时间降至18.15%。

Conclusion: ParaRevSNN适合资源受限场景，兼具高效性和准确性。

Abstract: Reversible Spiking Neural Networks (RevSNNs) enable memory-efficient training
by reconstructing forward activations during backpropagation, but suffer from
high latency due to strictly sequential computation. To overcome this
limitation, we propose ParaRevSNN, a parallel reversible SNN architecture that
decouples sequential dependencies between reversible blocks while preserving
reversibility. This design enables inter-block parallelism, significantly
accelerating training and inference while retaining the memory-saving benefits
of reversibility. Experiments on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, CIFAR10-DVS, and DVS128
Gesture demonstrate that ParaRevSNN matches or exceeds the accuracy of standard
RevSNNs, while reducing training time by up to 35.2\% and inference time to
18.15\%, making it well-suited for deployment in resource-constrained
scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种多缓存增强的原型测试时间适应方法（MCP）及其改进框架MCP++，通过三个缓存优化原型构建和预测校准，在15个下游任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于缓存的测试时间适应方法依赖低熵样本构建原型，但低熵样本在分布偏移下不可靠，且无法保证类内紧凑性。

Method: 提出MCP方法，包含熵缓存、对齐缓存和负缓存，分别用于初始化原型、整合视觉与文本信息以及预测校准。进一步开发MCP++框架，引入跨模态原型对齐和残差学习。

Result: 在15个下游任务中，MCP和MCP++实现了最优的泛化性能。

Conclusion: MCP和MCP++通过多缓存和跨模态对齐显著提升了测试时间适应的性能。

Abstract: In zero-shot setting, test-time adaptation adjusts pre-trained models using
unlabeled data from the test phase to enhance performance on unknown test
distributions. Existing cache-enhanced TTA methods rely on a low-entropy
criterion to select samples for prototype construction, assuming intra-class
compactness. However, low-entropy samples may be unreliable under distribution
shifts, and the resulting prototypes may not ensure compact intra-class
distributions. This study identifies a positive correlation between
cache-enhanced performance and intra-class compactness. Based on this
observation, we propose a Multi-Cache enhanced Prototype-based Test-Time
Adaptation (MCP) featuring three caches: an entropy cache for initializing
prototype representations with low-entropy samples, an align cache for
integrating visual and textual information to achieve compact intra-class
distributions, and a negative cache for prediction calibration using
high-entropy samples. We further developed MCP++, a framework incorporating
cross-modal prototype alignment and residual learning, introducing prototype
residual fine-tuning. Comparative and ablation experiments across 15 downstream
tasks demonstrate that the proposed method and framework achieve
state-of-the-art generalization performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多视图学习模型因假设类别完整性而在开放集场景中表现不佳，且视图诱导的静态偏差进一步削弱了识别未知类别的能力。

Method: 设计了O-Mix合成策略生成虚拟样本，并通过辅助模糊感知网络捕获非典型模式；引入HSIC对比去偏模块，增强视图独立性。

Result: 在多种多视图基准测试中，该框架显著提升了未知类别的识别能力，同时保持了封闭集性能。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了开放集学习中的模糊性和视图偏差问题，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Existing multi-view learning models struggle in open-set scenarios due to
their implicit assumption of class completeness. Moreover, static view-induced
biases, which arise from spurious view-label associations formed during
training, further degrade their ability to recognize unknown categories. In
this paper, we propose a multi-view open-set learning framework via ambiguity
uncertainty calibration and view-wise debiasing. To simulate ambiguous samples,
we design O-Mix, a novel synthesis strategy to generate virtual samples with
calibrated open-set ambiguity uncertainty. These samples are further processed
by an auxiliary ambiguity perception network that captures atypical patterns
for improved open-set adaptation. Furthermore, we incorporate an HSIC-based
contrastive debiasing module that enforces independence between view-specific
ambiguous and view-consistent representations, encouraging the model to learn
generalizable features. Extensive experiments on diverse multi-view benchmarks
demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently enhances unknown-class
recognition while preserving strong closed-set performance.

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应内容补偿方法（ACCM），通过图像描述减少视觉信息损失，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）的高计算成本限制了其广泛应用，现有方法在高剪枝率下性能下降严重。

Method: ACCM包括轻量级描述生成模型和选择器，通过自监督学习生成问题相关描述并选择合适内容。

Result: 在七个基准测试中，ACCM以更低的计算成本（如减少6.5% FLOPs）显著优于现有方法（提升20.6%）。

Conclusion: ACCM有效解决了高剪枝率下的视觉信息损失问题，提升了模型效率。

Abstract: Despite the great success of Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs), their high
computational cost severely limits their broad applications. The computational
cost of LVLMs mainly stems from the visual sequence of the input, which
consists of hundreds or even thousands of tokens. Although existing methods
have made progress by removing redundant tokens, they suffer from severe
performance degradation with high pruning rates due to the loss of visual
information. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Content Compensation Method
(ACCM), which can effectively mitigate the visual information loss via an image
caption. Specifically, ACCM comprises two key components: a lightweight caption
model and a selector. Firstly the caption model generates question-related
descriptions under the guidance of the user instruction. Then the selector
further identifies a contextually appropriate caption from multiple candidates.
Leveraging self-supervised learning, our modules could be learned efficiently
without any human or automated labeling. We conduct extensive experiments
across seven benchmarks and the results show that ACCM significantly
outperforms existing methods with lower FLOPs (e.g., surpassing SOTA by 20.6%
with 6.5% fewer FLOPs).

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中的标签噪声（如移动物体、非朗伯表面和阴影）导致3DGS重建错误，现有方法难以有效分离噪声或需要场景特定的超参数调整。

Method: 结合混合噪声评估和观察认知校正，设计基于动态锚点的标签噪声分类流程。

Result: OCSplats在不同复杂度的场景中均实现了领先的重建性能和精确的标签噪声分类。

Conclusion: OCSplats提供了一种无需调整参数即可适应不同噪声比例场景的解决方案，显著提升了3DGS的抗噪声重建能力。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become one of the most promising 3D
reconstruction technologies. However, label noise in real-world scenarios-such
as moving objects, non-Lambertian surfaces, and shadows-often leads to
reconstruction errors. Existing 3DGS-Bsed anti-noise reconstruction methods
either fail to separate noise effectively or require scene-specific fine-tuning
of hyperparameters, making them difficult to apply in practice. This paper
re-examines the problem of anti-noise reconstruction from the perspective of
epistemic uncertainty, proposing a novel framework, OCSplats. By combining key
technologies such as hybrid noise assessment and observation-based cognitive
correction, the accuracy of noise classification in areas with cognitive
differences has been significantly improved. Moreover, to address the issue of
varying noise proportions in different scenarios, we have designed a label
noise classification pipeline based on dynamic anchor points. This pipeline
enables OCSplats to be applied simultaneously to scenarios with vastly
different noise proportions without adjusting parameters. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that OCSplats always achieve leading reconstruction performance and
precise label noise classification in scenes of different complexity levels.

Motivation: 生成模型（如GAN和扩散模型）生成的图像越来越逼真，现有检测器在未知模型上泛化能力不足，尤其是语义内容接近时。

Method: 使用NULL-Space投影解耦CLIP视觉特征中的语义信息，结合对比学习捕捉真实与生成图像的分布差异，并设计Patch Selection策略减少全局结构带来的语义偏差。

Result: 在包含40种生成模型的开放世界基准测试中，NS-Net检测准确率提升7.4%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: NS-Net在GAN和扩散模型生成的图像检测中表现出强泛化能力，解决了CLIP特征语义信息干扰的问题。

Abstract: The rapid progress of generative models, such as GANs and diffusion models,
has facilitated the creation of highly realistic images, raising growing
concerns over their misuse in security-sensitive domains. While existing
detectors perform well under known generative settings, they often fail to
generalize to unknown generative models, especially when semantic content
between real and fake images is closely aligned. In this paper, we revisit the
use of CLIP features for AI-generated image detection and uncover a critical
limitation: the high-level semantic information embedded in CLIP's visual
features hinders effective discrimination. To address this, we propose NS-Net,
a novel detection framework that leverages NULL-Space projection to decouple
semantic information from CLIP's visual features, followed by contrastive
learning to capture intrinsic distributional differences between real and
generated images. Furthermore, we design a Patch Selection strategy to preserve
fine-grained artifacts by mitigating semantic bias caused by global image
structures. Extensive experiments on an open-world benchmark comprising images
generated by 40 diverse generative models show that NS-Net outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 7.4\% improvement in detection accuracy,
thereby demonstrating strong generalization across both GAN- and
diffusion-based image generation techniques.

Result: 在CelebAMask-HQ、LaPa和Helen数据集上验证了WSFP的难度和DisFaceRep的有效性。

Conclusion: DisFaceRep在弱监督面部解析任务中表现优异，代码已开源。

Abstract: Face parsing aims to segment facial images into key components such as eyes,
lips, and eyebrows. While existing methods rely on dense pixel-level
annotations, such annotations are expensive and labor-intensive to obtain. To
reduce annotation cost, we introduce Weakly Supervised Face Parsing (WSFP), a
new task setting that performs dense facial component segmentation using only
weak supervision, such as image-level labels and natural language descriptions.
WSFP introduces unique challenges due to the high co-occurrence and visual
similarity of facial components, which lead to ambiguous activations and
degraded parsing performance. To address this, we propose DisFaceRep, a
representation disentanglement framework designed to separate co-occurring
facial components through both explicit and implicit mechanisms. Specifically,
we introduce a co-occurring component disentanglement strategy to explicitly
reduce dataset-level bias, and a text-guided component disentanglement loss to
guide component separation using language supervision implicitly. Extensive
experiments on CelebAMask-HQ, LaPa, and Helen demonstrate the difficulty of
WSFP and the effectiveness of DisFaceRep, which significantly outperforms
existing weakly supervised semantic segmentation methods. The code will be
released at

Abstract: In this work, we handle a new problem of Open-Domain Open-Vocabulary (ODOV)
object detection, which considers the detection model's adaptability to the
real world including both domain and category shifts. For this problem, we
first construct a new benchmark OD-LVIS, which includes 46,949 images, covers
18 complex real-world domains and 1,203 categories, and provides a
comprehensive dataset for evaluating real-world object detection. Besides, we
develop a novel baseline method for ODOV detection.The proposed method first
leverages large language models to generate the domain-agnostic text prompts
for category embedding. It further learns the domain embedding from the given
image, which, during testing, can be integrated into the category embedding to
form the customized domain-specific category embedding for each test image. We
provide sufficient benchmark evaluations for the proposed ODOV detection task
and report the results, which verify the rationale of ODOV detection, the
usefulness of our benchmark, and the superiority of the proposed method.

Conclusion: 该方法通过跨模态语义一致性和自增强微调，有效提升了图像聚类的性能。

Abstract: While large language-image pre-trained models like CLIP offer powerful
generic features for image clustering, existing methods typically freeze the
encoder. This creates a fundamental mismatch between the model's task-agnostic
representations and the demands of a specific clustering task, imposing a
ceiling on performance. To break this ceiling, we propose a self-enhanced
framework based on cross-modal semantic consistency for efficient image
clustering. Our framework first builds a strong foundation via Cross-Modal
Semantic Consistency and then specializes the encoder through Self-Enhancement.
In the first stage, we focus on Cross-Modal Semantic Consistency. By mining
consistency between generated image-text pairs at the instance, cluster
assignment, and cluster center levels, we train lightweight clustering heads to
align with the rich semantics of the pre-trained model. This alignment process
is bolstered by a novel method for generating higher-quality cluster centers
and a dynamic balancing regularizer to ensure well-distributed assignments. In
the second stage, we introduce a Self-Enhanced fine-tuning strategy. The
well-aligned model from the first stage acts as a reliable pseudo-label
generator. These self-generated supervisory signals are then used to feed back
the efficient, joint optimization of the vision encoder and clustering heads,
unlocking their full potential. Extensive experiments on six mainstream
datasets show that our method outperforms existing deep clustering methods by
significant margins. Notably, our ViT-B/32 model already matches or even
surpasses the accuracy of state-of-the-art methods built upon the far larger
ViT-L/14.

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，STDNet优于现有方法。

Conclusion: STDNet通过空间和时间差异策略有效解决了深度超分辨率中的长尾分布问题，显著提升了重建质量。

Abstract: Depth super-resolution has achieved impressive performance, and the
incorporation of multi-frame information further enhances reconstruction
quality. Nevertheless, statistical analyses reveal that video depth
super-resolution remains affected by pronounced long-tailed distributions, with
the long-tailed effects primarily manifesting in spatial non-smooth regions and
temporal variation zones. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
SpatioTemporal Difference Network (STDNet) comprising two core branches: a
spatial difference branch and a temporal difference branch. In the spatial
difference branch, we introduce a spatial difference mechanism to mitigate the
long-tailed issues in spatial non-smooth regions. This mechanism dynamically
aligns RGB features with learned spatial difference representations, enabling
intra-frame RGB-D aggregation for depth calibration. In the temporal difference
branch, we further design a temporal difference strategy that preferentially
propagates temporal variation information from adjacent RGB and depth frames to
the current depth frame, leveraging temporal difference representations to
achieve precise motion compensation in temporal long-tailed areas. Extensive
experimental results across multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of
our STDNet, outperforming existing approaches.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Adversary-guided Curriculum Sampling (ACS)的方法，通过对抗性损失引导扩散模型采样，以减少信息冗余并提高数据集蒸馏的多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据集蒸馏在图像分辨率和每类图像数量增加时性能下降，且扩散模型生成的图像多样性不足导致信息冗余。

Method: ACS将蒸馏数据集分为多个课程，通过对抗性损失引导扩散采样，减少课程间信息重叠，并逐步提升图像复杂度。

Result: 实验显示ACS在Imagewoof和ImageNet-1k上分别比现有方法提高了4.1%和2.1%。

Conclusion: ACS通过对抗性引导和课程采样，有效提升了数据集蒸馏的多样性和性能。

Abstract: Dataset distillation aims to encapsulate the rich information contained in
dataset into a compact distilled dataset but it faces performance degradation
as the image-per-class (IPC) setting or image resolution grows larger. Recent
advancements demonstrate that integrating diffusion generative models can
effectively facilitate the compression of large-scale datasets while
maintaining efficiency due to their superiority in matching data distribution
and summarizing representative patterns. However, images sampled from diffusion
models are always blamed for lack of diversity which may lead to information
redundancy when multiple independent sampled images are aggregated as a
distilled dataset. To address this issue, we propose Adversary-guided
Curriculum Sampling (ACS), which partitions the distilled dataset into multiple
curricula. For generating each curriculum, ACS guides diffusion sampling
process by an adversarial loss to challenge a discriminator trained on sampled
images, thus mitigating information overlap between curricula and fostering a
more diverse distilled dataset. Additionally, as the discriminator evolves with
the progression of curricula, ACS generates images from simpler to more
complex, ensuring efficient and systematic coverage of target data
informational spectrum. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
ACS, which achieves substantial improvements of 4.1\% on Imagewoof and 2.1\% on
ImageNet-1k over the state-of-the-art.

TL;DR: ModelNet40-E是一个新的基准测试，用于评估点云分类模型在合成LiDAR噪声下的鲁棒性和校准性，提供噪声污染的点云和点级不确定性注释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试无法全面评估点云分类模型在噪声环境下的表现，特别是对不确定性建模的细粒度评估。

Method: 通过引入高斯噪声参数（σ, μ）生成噪声污染的点云，并评估PointNet、DGCNN和Point Transformer v3等模型在不同噪声水平下的分类准确性、校准指标和不确定性感知能力。

Result: 随着噪声增加，所有模型性能下降，但Point Transformer v3表现出更好的校准性，其预测的不确定性与实际测量不确定性更接近。

Conclusion: ModelNet40-E为点云分类模型的鲁棒性和校准性评估提供了新工具，Point Transformer v3在噪声环境下表现最优。

Abstract: We introduce ModelNet40-E, a new benchmark designed to assess the robustness
and calibration of point cloud classification models under synthetic LiDAR-like
noise. Unlike existing benchmarks, ModelNet40-E provides both noise-corrupted
point clouds and point-wise uncertainty annotations via Gaussian noise
parameters ({\sigma}, {\mu}), enabling fine-grained evaluation of uncertainty
modeling. We evaluate three popular models-PointNet, DGCNN, and Point
Transformer v3-across multiple noise levels using classification accuracy,
calibration metrics, and uncertainty-awareness. While all models degrade under
increasing noise, Point Transformer v3 demonstrates superior calibration, with
predicted uncertainties more closely aligned with the underlying measurement
uncertainty.

TL;DR: SGCap提出了一种零样本视频描述方法，通过语义组解码和关键句子选择模块，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有零样本视频描述方法因忽略时间动态性而表现不佳，需改进。

Method: 采用语义组解码策略建模帧间关系，并引入关键句子选择和概率采样监督模块。

Result: 在多个基准测试中显著优于现有零样本方法，甚至接近全监督方法。

Conclusion: SGCap通过建模时间动态性和语义多样性，有效提升了零样本视频描述性能。

Abstract: Zero-shot video captioning aims to generate sentences for describing videos
without training the model on video-text pairs, which remains underexplored.
Existing zero-shot image captioning methods typically adopt a text-only
training paradigm, where a language decoder reconstructs single-sentence
embeddings obtained from CLIP. However, directly extending them to the video
domain is suboptimal, as applying average pooling over all frames neglects
temporal dynamics. To address this challenge, we propose a Semantic Group
Captioning (SGCap) method for zero-shot video captioning. In particular, it
develops the Semantic Group Decoding (SGD) strategy to employ multi-frame
information while explicitly modeling inter-frame temporal relationships.
Furthermore, existing zero-shot captioning methods that rely on cosine
similarity for sentence retrieval and reconstruct the description supervised by
a single frame-level caption, fail to provide sufficient video-level
supervision. To alleviate this, we introduce two key components, including the
Key Sentences Selection (KSS) module and the Probability Sampling Supervision
(PSS) module. The two modules construct semantically-diverse sentence groups
that models temporal dynamics and guide the model to capture inter-sentence
causal relationships, thereby enhancing its generalization ability to video
captioning. Experimental results on several benchmarks demonstrate that SGCap
significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art zero-shot alternatives and
even achieves performance competitive with fully supervised ones. Code is
available at https://github.com/mlvccn/SGCap_Video.

TL;DR: PromptSafe是一个基于门控提示调优的框架，用于防止文本到图像（T2I）模型生成不安全内容，同时保持良性图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的T2I模型容易生成不安全内容（如暴力或色情图像），而当前的防御方法通常依赖大规模数据集且缺乏适应性。

Method: 通过LLM重写不安全提示为安全版本，构建文本训练语料；优化通用软提示并结合门控机制动态调整防御强度。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，PromptSafe将不安全生成率降至2.36%，同时保持高良性图像质量，并展现出强泛化性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PromptSafe为T2I模型提供了一种高效、自适应的安全防御方案，适合实际部署。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models have demonstrated remarkable generative
capabilities but remain vulnerable to producing not-safe-for-work (NSFW)
content, such as violent or explicit imagery. While recent moderation efforts
have introduced soft prompt-guided tuning by appending defensive tokens to the
input, these approaches often rely on large-scale curated image-text datasets
and apply static, one-size-fits-all defenses at inference time. However, this
results not only in high computational cost and degraded benign image quality,
but also in limited adaptability to the diverse and nuanced safety requirements
of real-world prompts. To address these challenges, we propose PromptSafe, a
gated prompt tuning framework that combines a lightweight, text-only supervised
soft embedding with an inference-time gated control network. Instead of
training on expensive image-text datasets, we first rewrite unsafe prompts into
semantically aligned but safe alternatives using an LLM, constructing an
efficient text-only training corpus. Based on this, we optimize a universal
soft prompt that repels unsafe and attracts safe embeddings during the
diffusion denoising process. To avoid over-suppressing benign prompts, we
introduce a gated mechanism that adaptively adjusts the defensive strength
based on estimated prompt toxicity, thereby aligning defense intensity with
prompt risk and ensuring strong protection for harmful inputs while preserving
benign generation quality. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and
T2I models show that PromptSafe achieves a SOTA unsafe generation rate (2.36%),
while preserving high benign fidelity. Furthermore, PromptSafe demonstrates
strong generalization to unseen harmful categories, robust transferability
across diffusion model architectures, and resilience under adaptive adversarial
attacks, highlighting its practical value for safe and scalable deployment.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的无监督立体匹配框架，通过置信度估计和深度先验损失函数，解决了现有方法在几何知识利用和噪声问题上的不足，并在KITTI Stereo基准上取得了最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无监督立体匹配因无需昂贵的视差标注而受到关注，但现有方法在多视图一致性假设下易受重复模式和纹理缺失区域的影响。

Method: 提出了一种包含视差置信度估计算法和两种深度先验损失函数的框架，通过局部一致性检查和准密集对应关系学习深度排序信息。

Result: 在KITTI Stereo基准上，该方法在所有无监督立体匹配方法中达到了最先进的匹配精度。

Conclusion: 该方法通过高效利用3D几何知识和减少噪声，显著提升了无监督立体匹配的性能。

Abstract: Unsupervised stereo matching has garnered significant attention for its
independence from costly disparity annotations. Typical unsupervised methods
rely on the multi-view consistency assumption for training networks, which
suffer considerably from stereo matching ambiguities, such as repetitive
patterns and texture-less regions. A feasible solution lies in transferring 3D
geometric knowledge from a relative depth map to the stereo matching networks.
However, existing knowledge transfer methods learn depth ranking information
from randomly built sparse correspondences, which makes inefficient utilization
of 3D geometric knowledge and introduces noise from mistaken disparity
estimates. This work proposes a novel unsupervised learning framework to
address these challenges, which comprises a plug-and-play disparity confidence
estimation algorithm and two depth prior-guided loss functions. Specifically,
the local coherence consistency between neighboring disparities and their
corresponding relative depths is first checked to obtain disparity confidence.
Afterwards, quasi-dense correspondences are built using only confident
disparity estimates to facilitate efficient depth ranking learning. Finally, a
dual disparity smoothness loss is proposed to boost stereo matching performance
at disparity discontinuities. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art stereo matching accuracy on the KITTI Stereo
benchmarks among all unsupervised stereo matching methods.

Result: 在肾癌和肺癌数据集上表现优于单提示基线，接近最先进模型。

Conclusion: 通过领域知识驱动的描述生成和文本编码策略，显著提升了MIL框架的性能。

Abstract: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is the leading approach for whole slide
image (WSI) classification, enabling efficient analysis of gigapixel pathology
slides. Recent work has introduced vision-language models (VLMs) into MIL
pipelines to incorporate medical knowledge through text-based class
descriptions rather than simple class names. However, when these methods rely
on large language models (LLMs) to generate clinical descriptions or use
fixed-length prompts to represent complex pathology concepts, the limited token
capacity of VLMs often constrains the expressiveness and richness of the
encoded class information. Additionally, descriptions generated solely by LLMs
may lack domain grounding and fine-grained medical specificity, leading to
suboptimal alignment with visual features. To address these challenges, we
propose a vision-language MIL framework with two key contributions: (1) A
grounded multi-agent description generation system that leverages curated
pathology textbooks and agent specialization (e.g., morphology, spatial
context) to produce accurate and diverse clinical descriptions; (2) A text
encoding strategy using a list of descriptions rather than a single prompt,
capturing fine-grained and complementary clinical signals for better alignment
with visual features. Integrated into a VLM-MIL pipeline, our approach shows
improved performance over single-prompt class baselines and achieves results
comparable to state-of-the-art models, as demonstrated on renal and lung cancer
datasets.

<details>

Motivation: 解决合成数据训练的立体匹配模型在真实数据上泛化能力差的问题，主要由于域差异（如颜色、光照等）。

Method: 利用RGB空间的图像统计信息（均值和标准差）生成未见域样本，并通过高斯分布建模扰动方向和强度的不确定性，同时强制原始与增强数据的特征一致性。

Result: 在多个挑战性基准测试中，该方法显著提升了现有立体匹配网络的泛化性能。

Conclusion: UgDA方法简单、架构无关，可有效提升立体匹配模型的跨域泛化能力。

Abstract: State-of-the-art stereo matching (SM) models trained on synthetic data often
fail to generalize to real data domains due to domain differences, such as
color, illumination, contrast, and texture. To address this challenge, we
leverage data augmentation to expand the training domain, encouraging the model
to acquire robust cross-domain feature representations instead of
domain-dependent shortcuts. This paper proposes an uncertainty-guided data
augmentation (UgDA) method, which argues that the image statistics in RGB space
(mean and standard deviation) carry the domain characteristics. Thus, samples
in unseen domains can be generated by properly perturbing these statistics.
Furthermore, to simulate more potential domains, Gaussian distributions founded
on batch-level statistics are poposed to model the unceratinty of perturbation
direction and intensity. Additionally, we further enforce feature consistency
between original and augmented data for the same scene, encouraging the model
to learn structure aware, shortcuts-invariant feature representations. Our
approach is simple, architecture-agnostic, and can be integrated into any SM
networks. Extensive experiments on several challenging benchmarks have
demonstrated that our method can significantly improve the generalization
performance of existing SM networks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RGB-based 3D任务中标注稀缺、昂贵且数据增强工具不足的问题。

Method: 提出3DRot，一种插件式数据增强方法，通过旋转和镜像图像并同步更新RGB图像、相机内参、物体姿态和3D标注，保持几何一致性。

Result: 在SUN RGB-D数据集上，3DRot显著提升了3D检测任务的性能（IoU3D、旋转误差和mAP0.5）。

Conclusion: 3DRot因其仅通过相机空间变换实现，可轻松迁移到其他3D任务中。

Abstract: RGB-based 3D tasks, e.g., 3D detection, depth estimation, 3D keypoint
estimation, still suffer from scarce, expensive annotations and a thin
augmentation toolbox, since most image transforms, including resize and
rotation, disrupt geometric consistency. In this paper, we introduce 3DRot, a
plug-and-play augmentation that rotates and mirrors images about the camera's
optical center while synchronously updating RGB images, camera intrinsics,
object poses, and 3D annotations to preserve projective geometry-achieving
geometry-consistent rotations and reflections without relying on any scene
depth. We validate 3DRot with a classical 3D task, monocular 3D detection. On
SUN RGB-D dataset, 3DRot raises $IoU_{3D}$ from 43.21 to 44.51, cuts rotation
error (ROT) from 22.91$^\circ$ to 20.93$^\circ$, and boosts $mAP_{0.5}$ from
35.70 to 38.11. As a comparison, Cube R-CNN adds 3 other datasets together with
SUN RGB-D for monocular 3D estimation, with a similar mechanism and test
dataset, increases $IoU_{3D}$ from 36.2 to 37.8, boosts $mAP_{0.5}$ from 34.7
to 35.4. Because it operates purely through camera-space transforms, 3DRot is
readily transferable to other 3D tasks.

Result: 在三个公开数据集上表现优异，AUROC分别为66.4%、83.1%和63.4%。

Conclusion: C3D-AD框架有效解决了多类别和持续学习问题，提升了3D异常检测的泛化能力。

Abstract: 3D Anomaly Detection (AD) has shown great potential in detecting anomalies or
defects of high-precision industrial products. However, existing methods are
typically trained in a class-specific manner and also lack the capability of
learning from emerging classes. In this study, we proposed a continual learning
framework named Continual 3D Anomaly Detection (C3D-AD), which can not only
learn generalized representations for multi-class point clouds but also handle
new classes emerging over time.Specifically, in the feature extraction module,
to extract generalized local features from diverse product types of different
tasks efficiently, Kernel Attention with random feature Layer (KAL) is
introduced, which normalizes the feature space. Then, to reconstruct data
correctly and continually, an efficient Kernel Attention with learnable Advisor
(KAA) mechanism is proposed, which learns the information from new categories
while discarding redundant old information within both the encoder and decoder.
Finally, to keep the representation consistency over tasks, a Reconstruction
with Parameter Perturbation (RPP) module is proposed by designing a
representation rehearsal loss function, which ensures that the model remembers
previous category information and returns category-adaptive
representation.Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving an average performance of
66.4%, 83.1%, and 63.4% AUROC on Real3D-AD, Anomaly-ShapeNet, and MulSen-AD,
respectively.

Abstract: Robot-assisted surgeries rely on accurate and real-time scene understanding
to safely guide surgical instruments. However, segmentation models trained on
static datasets face key limitations when deployed in these dynamic and
evolving surgical environments. Class-incremental semantic segmentation (CISS)
allows models to continually adapt to new classes while avoiding catastrophic
forgetting of prior knowledge, without training on previous data. In this work,
we build upon the recently introduced Taxonomy-Oriented Poincar\'e-regularized
Incremental Class Segmentation (TOPICS) approach and propose an enhanced
variant, termed TOPICS+, specifically tailored for robust segmentation of
surgical scenes. Concretely, we incorporate the Dice loss into the hierarchical
loss formulation to handle strong class imbalances, introduce hierarchical
pseudo-labeling, and design tailored label taxonomies for robotic surgery
environments. We also propose six novel CISS benchmarks designed for robotic
surgery environments including multiple incremental steps and several semantic
categories to emulate realistic class-incremental settings in surgical
environments. In addition, we introduce a refined set of labels with more than
144 classes on the Syn-Mediverse synthetic dataset, hosted online as an
evaluation benchmark. We make the code and trained models publicly available at

Conclusion: DiffSemanticFusion有效提升自动驾驶性能，扩散模块可扩展至其他方法。

Abstract: Autonomous driving requires accurate scene understanding, including road
geometry, traffic agents, and their semantic relationships. In online HD map
generation scenarios, raster-based representations are well-suited to vision
models but lack geometric precision, while graph-based representations retain
structural detail but become unstable without precise maps. To harness the
complementary strengths of both, we propose DiffSemanticFusion -- a fusion
framework for multimodal trajectory prediction and planning. Our approach
reasons over a semantic raster-fused BEV space, enhanced by a map diffusion
module that improves both the stability and expressiveness of online HD map
representations. We validate our framework on two downstream tasks: trajectory
prediction and planning-oriented end-to-end autonomous driving. Experiments on
real-world autonomous driving benchmarks, nuScenes and NAVSIM, demonstrate
improved performance over several state-of-the-art methods. For the prediction
task on nuScenes, we integrate DiffSemanticFusion with the online HD map
informed QCNet, achieving a 5.1\% performance improvement. For end-to-end
autonomous driving in NAVSIM, DiffSemanticFusion achieves state-of-the-art
results, with a 15\% performance gain in NavHard scenarios. In addition,
extensive ablation and sensitivity studies show that our map diffusion module
can be seamlessly integrated into other vector-based approaches to enhance
performance. All artifacts are available at

Abstract: Distal myopathy represents a genetically heterogeneous group of skeletal
muscle disorders with broad clinical manifestations, posing diagnostic
challenges in radiology. To address this, we propose a novel multimodal
attention-aware fusion architecture that combines features extracted from two
distinct deep learning models, one capturing global contextual information and
the other focusing on local details, representing complementary aspects of the
input data. Uniquely, our approach integrates these features through an
attention gate mechanism, enhancing both predictive performance and
interpretability. Our method achieves a high classification accuracy on the
BUSI benchmark and a proprietary distal myopathy dataset, while also generating
clinically relevant saliency maps that support transparent decision-making in
medical diagnosis. We rigorously evaluated interpretability through (1)
functionally grounded metrics, coherence scoring against reference masks and
incremental deletion analysis, and (2) application-grounded validation with
seven expert radiologists. While our fusion strategy boosts predictive
performance relative to single-stream and alternative fusion strategies, both
quantitative and qualitative evaluations reveal persistent gaps in anatomical
specificity and clinical usefulness of the interpretability. These findings
highlight the need for richer, context-aware interpretability methods and
human-in-the-loop feedback to meet clinicians' expectations in real-world
diagnostic settings.

Abstract: This paper presents a simple algebraic method to estimate the pose of a

the camera frame. The proposed approach follows a hierarchical structure;
first, the unit vector normal to the target plane is determined, followed by
the camera's position vector, its distance to the target plane, and finally,
the full orientation. To improve the method's robustness to measurement noise,
an averaging methodology is introduced to refine the estimation of the target's
normal direction. The accuracy and robustness of the approach are validated
through extensive experiments.

Conclusion: CSINet通过跨视图语义交互和多尺度特征整合，有效解决了遥感图像分割中的局限性。

Abstract: Recently, Referring Remote Sensing Image Segmentation (RRSIS) has aroused
wide attention. To handle drastic scale variation of remote targets, existing
methods only use the full image as input and nest the saliency-preferring
techniques of cross-scale information interaction into traditional single-view
structure. Although effective for visually salient targets, they still struggle
in handling tiny, ambiguous ones in lots of real scenarios. In this work, we
instead propose a paralleled yet unified segmentation framework Cross-view
Semantics Interaction Network (CSINet) to solve the limitations. Motivated by
human behavior in observing targets of interest, the network orchestrates
visual cues from remote and close distances to conduct synergistic prediction.
In its every encoding stage, a Cross-View Window-attention module (CVWin) is
utilized to supplement global and local semantics into close-view and
remote-view branch features, finally promoting the unified representation of
feature in every encoding stage. In addition, we develop a Collaboratively
Dilated Attention enhanced Decoder (CDAD) to mine the orientation property of
target and meanwhile integrate cross-view multiscale features. The proposed
network seamlessly enhances the exploitation of global and local semantics,
achieving significant improvements over others while maintaining satisfactory
speed.

transformer, deep features, and structure-from-motion into a unified framework.
To benchmark our method and foster further research, we introduce two newly
collected datasets specifically tailored for multi-altitude camera pose
estimation; datasets of this nature remain rare in the current literature. The
proposed framework has been validated through extensive comparative analyses on
these datasets, demonstrating that our system achieves superior performance in
both accuracy and robustness for multi-altitude sparse pose estimation tasks
compared to existing solutions, making it well suited for real-world robotic
applications such as aerial navigation, search and rescue, and automated

Conclusion: 结合生成扩散模型和统计色彩分割，为计算机辅助皮肤病学提供高效的无监督红斑检测方案。

Abstract: This study proposes a zero-shot image segmentation framework for detecting
erythema (redness of the skin) using edit-friendly inversion in diffusion
models. The method synthesizes reference images of the same patient that are
free from erythema via generative editing and then accurately aligns these
references with the original images. Color-space analysis is performed with
minimal user intervention to identify erythematous regions. This approach
significantly reduces the reliance on labeled dermatological datasets while
providing a scalable and flexible diagnostic support tool by avoiding the need
for any annotated training masks. In our initial qualitative experiments, the
pipeline successfully isolated facial erythema in diverse cases, demonstrating
performance improvements over baseline threshold-based techniques. These
results highlight the potential of combining generative diffusion models and
statistical color segmentation for computer-aided dermatology, enabling
efficient erythema detection without prior training data.

Abstract: Real-time synthesis of physically plausible human interactions remains a
critical challenge for immersive VR/AR systems and humanoid robotics. While
existing methods demonstrate progress in kinematic motion generation, they
often fail to address the fundamental tension between real-time responsiveness,
physical feasibility, and safety requirements in dynamic human-machine
interactions. We introduce Human-X, a novel framework designed to enable
immersive and physically plausible human interactions across diverse entities,
including human-avatar, human-humanoid, and human-robot systems. Unlike
existing approaches that focus on post-hoc alignment or simplified physics, our
method jointly predicts actions and reactions in real-time using an
auto-regressive reaction diffusion planner, ensuring seamless synchronization
and context-aware responses. To enhance physical realism and safety, we
integrate an actor-aware motion tracking policy trained with reinforcement
learning, which dynamically adapts to interaction partners' movements while
avoiding artifacts like foot sliding and penetration. Extensive experiments on
the Inter-X and InterHuman datasets demonstrate significant improvements in
motion quality, interaction continuity, and physical plausibility over
state-of-the-art methods. Our framework is validated in real-world
applications, including virtual reality interface for human-robot interaction,
showcasing its potential for advancing human-robot collaboration.

Result: 在单样本验证任务中表现优异，并在在线平台上验证有效性。

Conclusion: StyleSentinel为艺术作品版权保护提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The versatility of diffusion models in generating customized images has led
to unauthorized usage of personal artwork, which poses a significant threat to
the intellectual property of artists. Existing approaches relying on embedding
additional information, such as perturbations, watermarks, and backdoors,
suffer from limited defensive capabilities and fail to protect artwork
published online. In this paper, we propose StyleSentinel, an approach for
copyright protection of artwork by verifying an inherent stylistic fingerprint
in the artist's artwork. Specifically, we employ a semantic self-reconstruction
process to enhance stylistic expressiveness within the artwork, which
establishes a dense and style-consistent manifold foundation for feature
learning. Subsequently, we adaptively fuse multi-layer image features to encode
abstract artistic style into a compact stylistic fingerprint. Finally, we model
the target artist's style as a minimal enclosing hypersphere boundary in the
feature space, transforming complex copyright verification into a robust
one-class learning task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that compared with
the state-of-the-art, StyleSentinel achieves superior performance on the
one-sample verification task. We also demonstrate the effectiveness through
online platforms.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于事件的单次积分（ESI）方法，用于实时高效地重建强度图像，适用于无人机视觉跟踪等场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件相机具有高动态范围、高时间分辨率和抗运动模糊等优势，但如何从异步事件流中提取有效信息并实现实时处理是挑战。

Method: ESI通过单次积分事件流结合增强衰减算法重建强度图像，实现高帧率（100 FPS）和低计算负载。

Result: ESI在运行时效率、重建质量和帧率上优于现有算法，显著提升了无人机在低光照条件下的视觉跟踪性能。

Conclusion: ESI是一种高效、便携的方法，能够充分利用事件相机的优势，适用于实时视觉任务。

Abstract: Event cameras offer significant advantages, including a wide dynamic range,
high temporal resolution, and immunity to motion blur, making them highly
promising for addressing challenging visual conditions. Extracting and
utilizing effective information from asynchronous event streams is essential
for the onboard implementation of event cameras. In this paper, we propose a
streamlined event-based intensity reconstruction scheme, event-based single
integration (ESI), to address such implementation challenges. This method
guarantees the portability of conventional frame-based vision methods to
event-based scenarios and maintains the intrinsic advantages of event cameras.
The ESI approach reconstructs intensity images by performing a single
integration of the event streams combined with an enhanced decay algorithm.
Such a method enables real-time intensity reconstruction at a high frame rate,
typically 100 FPS. Furthermore, the relatively low computation load of ESI fits
onboard implementation suitably, such as in UAV-based visual tracking
scenarios. Extensive experiments have been conducted to evaluate the
performance comparison of ESI and state-of-the-art algorithms. Compared to
state-of-the-art algorithms, ESI demonstrates remarkable runtime efficiency
improvements, superior reconstruction quality, and a high frame rate. As a
result, ESI enhances UAV onboard perception significantly under visual
adversary surroundings. In-flight tests, ESI demonstrates effective performance
for UAV onboard visual tracking under extremely low illumination
conditions(2-10lux), whereas other comparative algorithms fail due to
insufficient frame rate, poor image quality, or limited real-time performance.

Conclusion: ViLaCo通过引入语义监督和对比一致性模块，有效弥补弱监督的不足，实现了高精度的伪造定位。

Abstract: Image forgery localization aims to precisely identify tampered regions within
images, but it commonly depends on costly pixel-level annotations. To alleviate
this annotation burden, weakly supervised image forgery localization (WSIFL)
has emerged, yet existing methods still achieve limited localization
performance as they mainly exploit intra-image consistency clues and lack
external semantic guidance to compensate for weak supervision. In this paper,
we propose ViLaCo, a vision-language collaborative reasoning framework that
introduces auxiliary semantic supervision distilled from pre-trained
vision-language models (VLMs), enabling accurate pixel-level localization using
only image-level labels. Specifically, ViLaCo first incorporates semantic
knowledge through a vision-language feature modeling network, which jointly
extracts textual and visual priors using pre-trained VLMs. Next, an adaptive
vision-language reasoning network aligns textual semantics and visual features
through mutual interactions, producing semantically aligned representations.
Subsequently, these representations are passed into dual prediction heads,
where the coarse head performs image-level classification and the fine head
generates pixel-level localization masks, thereby bridging the gap between weak
supervision and fine-grained localization. Moreover, a contrastive patch
consistency module is introduced to cluster tampered features while separating
authentic ones, facilitating more reliable forgery discrimination. Extensive
experiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate that ViLaCo substantially
outperforms existing WSIFL methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance in
both detection and localization accuracy.

Abstract: Existing methods for rotation estimation between two spherical
($\mathbb{S}^2$) patterns typically rely on spherical cross-correlation
maximization between two spherical function. However, these approaches exhibit
computational complexities greater than cubic $O(n^3)$ with respect to rotation
space discretization and lack extensive evaluation under significant outlier
contamination. To this end, we propose a rotation estimation algorithm between
two spherical patterns with linear time complexity $O(n)$. Unlike existing
spherical-function-based methods, we explicitly represent spherical patterns as
discrete 3D point sets on the unit sphere, reformulating rotation estimation as
a spherical point-set alignment (i.e., Wahba problem for 3D unit vectors).
Given the geometric nature of our formulation, our spherical pattern alignment
algorithm naturally aligns with the Wahba problem framework for 3D unit
vectors. Specifically, we introduce three novel algorithms: (1) SPMC (Spherical
Pattern Matching by Correlation), (2) FRS (Fast Rotation Search), and (3) a
hybrid approach (SPMC+FRS) that combines the advantages of the previous two
methods. Our experiments demonstrate that in the $\mathbb{S}^2$ domain and in
correspondence-free settings, our algorithms are over 10x faster and over 10x
more accurate than current state-of-the-art methods for the Wahba problem with
outliers. We validate our approach through extensive simulations on a new
dataset of spherical patterns, the ``Robust Vector Alignment Dataset.
"Furthermore, we adapt our methods to two real-world tasks: (i) Point Cloud
Registration (PCR) and (ii) rotation estimation for spherical images.

Abstract: Pedestrians Localization in Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) regions within urban
environments poses a significant challenge for autonomous driving systems.
While mmWave radar has demonstrated potential for detecting objects in such
scenarios, the 2D radar point cloud (PCD) data is susceptible to distortions
caused by multipath reflections, making accurate spatial inference difficult.
Additionally, although camera images provide high-resolution visual
information, they lack depth perception and cannot directly observe objects in
NLoS regions. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that interprets radar
PCD through road layout inferred from camera for localization of NLoS
pedestrians. The proposed method leverages visual information from the camera
to interpret 2D radar PCD, enabling spatial scene reconstruction. The
effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through experiments
conducted using a radar-camera system mounted on a real vehicle. The
localization performance is evaluated using a dataset collected in outdoor NLoS
driving environments, demonstrating the practical applicability of the method.

Result: 实验显示对象发现提升10分，动态建模任务也受益。

Conclusion: RandSF.Q显著优于现有方法，为视频OCL设定了新标杆。

Abstract: Unsupervised video Object-Centric Learning (OCL) is promising as it enables
object-level scene representation and dynamics modeling as we humans do.
Mainstream video OCL methods adopt a recurrent architecture: An aggregator
aggregates current video frame into object features, termed slots, under some
queries; A transitioner transits current slots to queries for the next frame.
This is an effective architecture but all existing implementations both
(\textit{i1}) neglect to incorporate next frame features, the most informative
source for query prediction, and (\textit{i2}) fail to learn transition
dynamics, the knowledge essential for query prediction. To address these
issues, we propose Random Slot-Feature pair for learning Query prediction
(RandSF.Q): (\textit{t1}) We design a new transitioner to incorporate both
slots and features, which provides more information for query prediction;
(\textit{t2}) We train the transitioner to predict queries from slot-feature
pairs randomly sampled from available recurrences, which drives it to learn
transition dynamics. Experiments on scene representation demonstrate that our
method surpass existing video OCL methods significantly, e.g., up to 10 points
on object discovery, setting new state-of-the-art. Such superiority also
benefits downstream tasks like dynamics modeling. Our core source code and
training logs are available as the supplement.

Conclusion: MonoDream通过轻量级设计和潜在全景预测任务，实现了单目视觉导航的高效性能提升。

Abstract: Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) tasks often leverage panoramic RGB and depth
inputs to provide rich spatial cues for action planning, but these sensors can
be costly or less accessible in real-world deployments. Recent approaches based
on Vision-Language Action (VLA) models achieve strong results with monocular
input, yet they still lag behind methods using panoramic RGB-D information. We
present MonoDream, a lightweight VLA framework that enables monocular agents to
learn a Unified Navigation Representation (UNR). This shared feature
representation jointly aligns navigation-relevant visual semantics (e.g.,
global layout, depth, and future cues) and language-grounded action intent,
enabling more reliable action prediction. MonoDream further introduces Latent
Panoramic Dreaming (LPD) tasks to supervise the UNR, which train the model to
predict latent features of panoramic RGB and depth observations at both current
and future steps based on only monocular input. Experiments on multiple VLN
benchmarks show that MonoDream consistently improves monocular navigation
performance and significantly narrows the gap with panoramic-based agents.

Abstract: It is of crucial importance to assess damages promptly and accurately in

Abstract: False positives in pedestrian detection remain a challenge that has yet to be
effectively resolved. To address this issue, this paper proposes a Full-stage
Refined Proposal (FRP) algorithm aimed at eliminating these false positives
within a two-stage CNN-based pedestrian detection framework. The main
innovation of this work lies in employing various pedestrian feature
re-evaluation strategies to filter out low-quality pedestrian proposals during
both the training and testing stages. Specifically, in the training phase, the
Training mode FRP algorithm (TFRP) introduces a novel approach for validating
pedestrian proposals to effectively guide the model training process, thereby
constructing a model with strong capabilities for false positive suppression.
During the inference phase, two innovative strategies are implemented: the
Classifier-guided FRP (CFRP) algorithm integrates a pedestrian classifier into
the proposal generation pipeline to yield high-quality proposals through
pedestrian feature evaluation, and the Split-proposal FRP (SFRP) algorithm
vertically divides all proposals, sending both the original and the sub-region
proposals to the subsequent subnetwork to evaluate their confidence scores,
filtering out those with lower sub-region pedestrian confidence scores. As a
result, the proposed algorithm enhances the model's ability to suppress
pedestrian false positives across all stages. Various experiments conducted on
multiple benchmarks and the SY-Metro datasets demonstrate that the model,
supported by different combinations of the FRP algorithm, can effectively
eliminate false positives to varying extents. Furthermore, experiments
conducted on embedded platforms underscore the algorithm's effectiveness in
enhancing the comprehensive pedestrian detection capabilities of the small
pedestrian detector in resource-constrained edge devices.

Abstract: Currently, lightweight hybrid backbone networks have partially alleviated the
issue of computational saturation, but the imbalance in computational
efficiencys between convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and attention
mechanisms is becoming increasingly apparent. Specifically, although linear
attention mechanisms and their variants have made progress in lightweight
design, they still fail to meet the demands of hybrid models for long-sequence
modeling. On the other hand, existing lightweight SoftMax attention
computations typically reduce the feature map to a fixed size to decrease the
number of sequences, thereby compressing the computational scale. However, the
process of determining the feature map reduction ratio is cumbersome, and
computational saturation issues still persist. To address this issue, this
paper proposes a lightweight SoftMax attention mechanism with adaptive feature
map sizes, named Fast Window Attention (FWA), which generates a small number of
key sequences (Key and Value) through window aggregation for attention
computation. Additionally, it explains the rationality of using ReLU to
simulate SoftMax operations in lightweight global attention mechanisms.
Finally, the paper designs a global-local feature fusion mechanism and combines
it with GhostNet to propose a lightweight hybrid backbone network, LOLViT.
Through visual tasks such as classification (ImageNet 1K), detection (COCO
2017), and segmentation (BDD100K), along with extensive ablation studies, it is
demonstrated that LOLViT outperforms CNN models of the same level in both
inference speed and model accuracy. Notably, the inference speed of LOLViT-X is
5x that of MobileViT-X.

Motivation: 随着机器人探索任务的复杂性增加，高质量数字地形图（DTM）的需求日益增长，但传统方法需要大量手动预处理。

Method: NTM方法仅需每个图像像素的轨迹，无需深度或其他结构先验，适用于合成和真实卫星数据。

Result: 实验表明，NTM在合成和真实数据（地球和火星）上表现良好，地形预测精度接近卫星图像分辨率。

Abstract: Digital terrain maps (DTMs) are an important part of planetary exploration,
enabling operations such as terrain relative navigation during entry, descent,
and landing for spacecraft and aiding in navigation on the ground. As robotic
exploration missions become more ambitious, the need for high quality DTMs will
only increase. However, producing DTMs via multi-view stereo pipelines for
satellite imagery, the current state-of-the-art, can be cumbersome and require
significant manual image preprocessing to produce satisfactory results. In this
work, we seek to address these shortcomings by adapting neural volume rendering
techniques to learn textured digital terrain maps directly from satellite
imagery. Our method, neural terrain maps (NTM), only requires the locus for
each image pixel and does not rely on depth or any other structural priors. We
demonstrate our method on both synthetic and real satellite data from Earth and
Mars encompassing scenes on the order of $100 \textrm{km}^2$. We evaluate the
accuracy of our output terrain maps by comparing with existing high-quality
DTMs produced using traditional multi-view stereo pipelines. Our method shows
promising results, with the precision of terrain prediction almost equal to the
resolution of the satellite images even in the presence of imperfect camera
intrinsics and extrinsics.

Conclusion: VLMs为动态交通视频分析提供了经济高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Automatic license plate recognition (ALPR) and vehicle make and model
recognition underpin intelligent transportation systems, supporting law
enforcement, toll collection, and post-incident investigation. Applying these
methods to videos captured by handheld smartphones or non-static
vehicle-mounted cameras presents unique challenges compared to fixed
installations, including frequent camera motion, varying viewpoints,
occlusions, and unknown road geometry. Traditional ALPR solutions, dependent on
specialized hardware and handcrafted OCR pipelines, often degrade under these
conditions. Recent advances in large vision-language models (VLMs) enable
direct recognition of textual and semantic attributes from arbitrary imagery.
This study evaluates the potential of VLMs for ALPR and makes and models
recognition using monocular videos captured with handheld smartphones and
non-static mounted cameras. The proposed license plate recognition pipeline
filters to sharp frames, then sends a multimodal prompt to a VLM using several
prompt strategies. Make and model recognition pipeline runs the same VLM with a
revised prompt and an optional self-reflection module. In the self-reflection
module, the model contrasts the query image with a reference from a 134-class
dataset, correcting mismatches. Experiments on a smartphone dataset collected
on the campus of the University of Texas at Austin, achieve top-1 accuracies of
91.67% for ALPR and 66.67% for make and model recognition. On the public
UFPR-ALPR dataset, the approach attains 83.05% and 61.07%, respectively. The
self-reflection module further improves results by 5.72% on average for make
and model recognition. These findings demonstrate that VLMs provide a
cost-effective solution for scalable, in-motion traffic video analysis.

Result: 实验验证了OAPR任务的必要性和框架的有效性。

Conclusion: OAPR任务和提出的框架解决了开放属性识别问题，提升了人物检索的实用性。

Abstract: Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) plays a crucial role in various vision
tasks such as person retrieval and identification. Most existing
attribute-based retrieval methods operate under the closed-set assumption that
all attribute classes are consistently available during both training and
inference. However, this assumption limits their applicability in real-world
scenarios where novel attributes may emerge. Moreover, predefined attributes in
benchmark datasets are often generic and shared across individuals, making them
less discriminative for retrieving the target person. To address these
challenges, we propose the Open-Attribute Recognition for Person Retrieval
(OAPR) task, which aims to retrieve individuals based on attribute cues,
regardless of whether those attributes were seen during training. To support
this task, we introduce a novel framework designed to learn generalizable body
part representations that cover a broad range of attribute categories.
Furthermore, we reconstruct four widely used datasets for open-attribute
recognition. Comprehensive experiments on these datasets demonstrate the
necessity of the OAPR task and the effectiveness of our framework. The source
code and pre-trained models will be publicly available upon publication.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于空间和频率域协同的RAW图像目标检测增强框架SFAE，通过频率域特征恢复被抑制的细节。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要在空间域处理RAW图像，难以有效恢复因动态范围和线性响应而丢失的细节。

Method: 提出SFAE框架，将频率域特征逆变换为空间映射，开发跨域融合注意力模块，并进行自适应非线性调整。

Result: SFAE能够有效恢复RAW图像中被抑制的细节，提升目标检测性能。

Conclusion: 通过结合空间和频率域特征，SFAE为RAW图像目标检测提供了更有效的增强方法。

Abstract: Direct RAW-based object detection offers great promise by utilizing RAW data
(unprocessed sensor data), but faces inherent challenges due to its wide
dynamic range and linear response, which tends to suppress crucial object
details. In particular, existing enhancement methods are almost all performed
in the spatial domain, making it difficult to effectively recover these
suppressed details from the skewed pixel distribution of RAW images. To address
this limitation, we turn to the frequency domain, where features, such as
object contours and textures, can be naturally separated based on frequency. In
this paper, we propose Space-Frequency Aware RAW Image Object Detection
Enhancer (SFAE), a novel framework that synergizes spatial and frequency
representations. Our contribution is threefold. The first lies in the
``spatialization" of frequency bands. Different from the traditional paradigm
of directly manipulating abstract spectra in deep networks, our method
inversely transforms individual frequency bands back into tangible spatial
maps, thus preserving direct physical intuition. Then the cross-domain fusion
attention module is developed to enable deep multimodal interactions between
these maps and the original spatial features. Finally, the framework performs
adaptive nonlinear adjustments by predicting and applying different gamma
parameters for the two domains.

Abstract: Advances in generative models have led to AI-generated images visually
indistinguishable from authentic ones. Despite numerous studies on detecting
AI-generated images with classifiers, a gap persists between such methods and
human cognitive forensic analysis. We present ForenX, a novel method that not
only identifies the authenticity of images but also provides explanations that
resonate with human thoughts. ForenX employs the powerful multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) to analyze and interpret forensic cues. Furthermore, we
overcome the limitations of standard MLLMs in detecting forgeries by
incorporating a specialized forensic prompt that directs the MLLMs attention to
forgery-indicative attributes. This approach not only enhance the
generalization of forgery detection but also empowers the MLLMs to provide
explanations that are accurate, relevant, and comprehensive. Additionally, we
introduce ForgReason, a dataset dedicated to descriptions of forgery evidences
in AI-generated images. Curated through collaboration between an LLM-based
agent and a team of human annotators, this process provides refined data that
further enhances our model's performance. We demonstrate that even limited
manual annotations significantly improve explanation quality. We evaluate the
effectiveness of ForenX on two major benchmarks. The model's explainability is
verified by comprehensive subjective evaluations.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose SPECTRUM, a temporal-frequency synergistic model
that unlocks the untapped potential of multi-domain representation learning for
online handwriting verification (OHV). SPECTRUM comprises three core
components: (1) a multi-scale interactor that finely combines temporal and
frequency features through dual-modal sequence interaction and multi-scale
aggregation, (2) a self-gated fusion module that dynamically integrates global
temporal and frequency features via self-driven balancing. These two components
work synergistically to achieve micro-to-macro spectral-temporal integration.
(3) A multi-domain distance-based verifier then utilizes both temporal and
frequency representations to improve discrimination between genuine and forged
handwriting, surpassing conventional temporal-only approaches. Extensive
experiments demonstrate SPECTRUM's superior performance over existing OHV
methods, underscoring the effectiveness of temporal-frequency multi-domain
learning. Furthermore, we reveal that incorporating multiple handwritten
biometrics fundamentally enhances the discriminative power of handwriting
representations and facilitates verification. These findings not only validate
the efficacy of multi-domain learning in OHV but also pave the way for future
research in multi-domain approaches across both feature and biometric domains.

Conclusion: 多粒度非局部自相似性先验模型具有强适用性和优异恢复效果。

Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) recovery, as an upstream image processing task,
  holds significant importance for downstream tasks such as classification,
  segmentation, and detection. In recent years, HSI recovery methods based on
  non-local prior representations have demonstrated outstanding performance.
However,
  these methods employ a fixed-format factor to represent the non-local
self-similarity
  tensor groups, making them unable to adapt to diverse missing scenarios. To
address
  this issue, we introduce the concept of granularity in tensor decomposition
for the first
  time and propose an HSI recovery model constrained by multi-granularity
non-local
  self-similarity priors. Specifically, the proposed model alternately performs
  coarse-grained decomposition and fine-grained decomposition on the non-local
  self-similarity tensor groups. Among them, the coarse-grained decomposition
builds
  upon Tucker tensor decomposition, which extracts global structural
information of the
  image by performing singular value shrinkage on the mode-unfolded matrices.
The
  fine-grained decomposition employs the FCTN decomposition, capturing local
detail
  information through modeling pairwise correlations among factor tensors. This
  architectural approach achieves a unified representation of global, local,
and non-local
  priors for HSIs. Experimental results demonstrate that the model has strong
  applicability and exhibits outstanding recovery effects in various types of
missing
  scenes such as pixels and stripes.

Abstract: Image segmentation is a critical step in computational biomedical image
analysis, typically evaluated using metrics like the Dice coefficient during
training and validation. However, in clinical settings without manual
annotations, assessing segmentation quality becomes challenging, and models
lacking reliability indicators face adoption barriers. To address this gap, we
propose a novel framework for predicting segmentation quality without requiring
ground truth annotations during test time. Our approach introduces two
complementary frameworks: one leveraging predicted segmentation and uncertainty
maps, and another integrating the original input image, uncertainty maps, and
predicted segmentation maps. We present Bayesian adaptations of two benchmark
segmentation models-SwinUNet and Feature Pyramid Network with ResNet50-using
Monte Carlo Dropout, Ensemble, and Test Time Augmentation to quantify
uncertainty. We evaluate four uncertainty estimates: confidence map, entropy,
mutual information, and expected pairwise Kullback-Leibler divergence on 2D
skin lesion and 3D liver segmentation datasets, analyzing their correlation
with segmentation quality metrics. Our framework achieves an R2 score of 93.25
and Pearson correlation of 96.58 on the HAM10000 dataset, outperforming
previous segmentation quality assessment methods. For 3D liver segmentation,
Test Time Augmentation with entropy achieves an R2 score of 85.03 and a Pearson
correlation of 65.02, demonstrating cross-modality robustness. Additionally, we
propose an aggregation strategy that combines multiple uncertainty estimates
into a single score per image, offering a more robust and comprehensive
assessment of segmentation quality. Finally, we use Grad-CAM and UMAP-based
embedding analysis to interpret the model's behavior and reliability,
highlighting the impact of uncertainty integration.

Conclusion: Can3Tok为下游生成任务（如图像到3DGS、文本到3DGS）提供了有效支持。

Abstract: 3D generation has made significant progress, however, it still largely
remains at the object-level. Feedforward 3D scene-level generation has been
rarely explored due to the lack of models capable of scaling-up latent
representation learning on 3D scene-level data. Unlike object-level generative
models, which are trained on well-labeled 3D data in a bounded canonical space,
scene-level generations with 3D scenes represented by 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS) are unbounded and exhibit scale inconsistency across different scenes,
making unified latent representation learning for generative purposes extremely
challenging. In this paper, we introduce Can3Tok, the first 3D scene-level
variational autoencoder (VAE) capable of encoding a large number of Gaussian
primitives into a low-dimensional latent embedding, which effectively captures
both semantic and spatial information of the inputs. Beyond model design, we
propose a general pipeline for 3D scene data processing to address scale
inconsistency issue. We validate our method on the recent scene-level 3D
dataset DL3DV-10K, where we found that only Can3Tok successfully generalizes to
novel 3D scenes, while compared methods fail to converge on even a few hundred
scene inputs during training and exhibit zero generalization ability during
inference. Finally, we demonstrate image-to-3DGS and text-to-3DGS generation as
our applications to demonstrate its ability to facilitate downstream generation
tasks.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient brain tumor segmentation remains a critical challenge
in neuroimaging due to the heterogeneous nature of tumor subregions and the
high computational cost of volumetric inference. In this paper, we propose
EfficientGFormer, a novel architecture that integrates pretrained foundation
models with graph-based reasoning and lightweight efficiency mechanisms for
robust 3D brain tumor segmentation. Our framework leverages nnFormer as a
modality-aware encoder, transforming multi-modal MRI volumes into patch-level
embeddings. These features are structured into a dual-edge graph that captures
both spatial adjacency and semantic similarity. A pruned, edge-type-aware Graph
Attention Network (GAT) enables efficient relational reasoning across tumor
subregions, while a distillation module transfers knowledge from a
full-capacity teacher to a compact student model for real-time deployment.
Experiments on the MSD Task01 and BraTS 2021 datasets demonstrate that
EfficientGFormer achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with significantly reduced
memory and inference time, outperforming recent transformer-based and

Abstract: Recent advances in generative models have highlighted the need for robust
detectors capable of distinguishing real images from AI-generated images. While
existing methods perform well on known generators, their performance often
declines when tested with newly emerging or unseen generative models due to
overlapping feature embeddings that hinder accurate cross-generator
classification. In this paper, we propose Multimodal Discriminative
Representation Learning for Generalizable AI-generated Image Detection
(MiraGe), a method designed to learn generator-invariant features. Motivated by
theoretical insights on intra-class variation minimization and inter-class
separation, MiraGe tightly aligns features within the same class while
maximizing separation between classes, enhancing feature discriminability.
Moreover, we apply multimodal prompt learning to further refine these
principles into CLIP, leveraging text embeddings as semantic anchors for
effective discriminative representation learning, thereby improving
generalizability. Comprehensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show
that MiraGe achieves state-of-the-art performance, maintaining robustness even
against unseen generators like Sora.

on video, and finally refining with temporal-aware reinforcement learning. We
build upon Temporal Group Relative Policy Optimization (T-GRPO) by
incorporating temporal consistency modeling into policy optimization. We also
propose a biomechanically-motivated sub-action decomposition mechanism that
provides graduated rewards for constituent action phases. Through experiments

However, the substantial computational and storage demands of VLMs pose
significant challenges for their efficient deployment on mobile devices, which
represent the most ubiquitous and accessible computing platforms today. In this

adaptively generates image tokens without excessive modification of image
dimensions. To further enhance the performance of this compact encoder within
VLMs, we propose a multimodal curriculum learning strategy that incrementally
increases task difficulty and data information density throughout training.
This approach substantially improves the model's performance across a variety

MagicVL-2B matches the accuracy of current state-of-the-art models while
reducing on-device power consumption by 41.1%. These results establish
MagicVL-2B as a practical and robust solution for real-world mobile

Result: 在四个公共基准测试中，E-VRAG减少约70%计算成本且准确性更高。

Conclusion: E-VRAG显著提升了视频RAG任务的效率和准确性，无需额外训练。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have enabled substantial progress in video
understanding by leveraging cross-modal reasoning capabilities. However, their
effectiveness is limited by the restricted context window and the high
computational cost required to process long videos with thousands of frames.
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) addresses this challenge by selecting only
the most relevant frames as input, thereby reducing the computational burden.
Nevertheless, existing video RAG methods struggle to balance retrieval
efficiency and accuracy, particularly when handling diverse and complex video
content. To address these limitations, we propose E-VRAG, a novel and efficient
video RAG framework for video understanding. We first apply a frame
pre-filtering method based on hierarchical query decomposition to eliminate
irrelevant frames, reducing computational costs at the data level. We then
employ a lightweight VLM for frame scoring, further reducing computational
costs at the model level. Additionally, we propose a frame retrieval strategy
that leverages the global statistical distribution of inter-frame scores to
mitigate the potential performance degradation from using a lightweight VLM.
Finally, we introduce a multi-view question answering scheme for the retrieved
frames, enhancing the VLM's capability to extract and comprehend information
from long video contexts. Experiments on four public benchmarks show that
E-VRAG achieves about 70% reduction in computational cost and higher accuracy
compared to baseline methods, all without additional training. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of E-VRAG in improving both efficiency and
accuracy for video RAG tasks.

results in degraded model performance. To address this issue, we introduce a
dynamic pruning framework, GlimpsePrune, inspired by human cognition. It takes
a data-driven ''glimpse'' and prunes irrelevant visual tokens in a single
forward pass before answer generation. This approach prunes 92.6% of visual
tokens while on average fully retaining the baseline performance on free-form
VQA tasks. The reduced computational cost also enables more effective
fine-tuning: an enhanced GlimpsePrune+ achieves 110% of the baseline
performance while maintaining a similarly high pruning rate. Our work paves a
new way for building more powerful and efficient LVLMs.

TL;DR: 提出EvoVLMA方法，利用LLM辅助进化算法自动搜索无需训练的高效视觉语言模型适应算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型适应方法依赖人工设计，耗时且需经验。

Method: 两阶段LLM辅助进化算法优化特征选择和logits计算，结合低精度代码转换和在线执行。

Result: 在8-shot图像分类中，APE算法识别准确率提升1.91%。

Conclusion: EvoVLMA为预训练多模态模型适应算法的自动化优化开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been exploited in various
Computer Vision tasks (e.g., few-shot recognition) via model adaptation, such
as prompt tuning and adapters. However, existing adaptation methods are
designed by human experts, requiring significant time cost and experience.
Inspired by recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) based code
generation, we propose an Evolutionary Vision-Language Model Adaptation
(EvoVLMA) method to automatically search training-free efficient adaptation
algorithms for VLMs. We recognize feature selection and logits computation as
the key functions in training-free VLM adaptation, and propose a two-stage
LLM-assisted evolutionary algorithm for optimizing these parts in a sequential
manner, effectively addressing the challenge posed by the expansive search
space through a divide-and-conquer strategy. Besides, to enhance the stability
and efficiency of searching process, we propose low-precision code conversion,
web based code execution and process monitoring, leading to a highly effective
automatic algorithm design system. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
algorithms found by EvoVLMA can obtain promising results compared to previous
manually-designed ones. More specifically, in the 8-shot image classification
setting, the classical APE algorithm can be improved by 1.91 points in
recognition accuracy. This research opens new possibilities for automating the
optimization of adaptation algorithms of pre-trained multimodal models. Code is

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于历史感知的自适应扫描框架，通过预测感兴趣区域（ROI）减少LiDAR冗余扫描，降低能耗65%，同时保持3D物体检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LiDAR传感器在密集扫描时忽略时间连续性，导致冗余和能耗高，限制了其在资源受限平台上的实用性。

Method: 使用轻量级预测网络提取历史时空上下文，生成查询嵌入，指导可微分掩码生成器通过Gumbel-Softmax采样识别关键ROI，实现自适应扫描。

Result: 在nuScenes和Lyft基准测试中，能耗降低65%，3D物体检测性能与传统密集扫描方法相当或更优。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了LiDAR的能效，为资源受限平台提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-sensor fusion using LiDAR and RGB cameras significantly enhances 3D
object detection task. However, conventional LiDAR sensors perform dense,
stateless scans, ignoring the strong temporal continuity in real-world scenes.
This leads to substantial sensing redundancy and excessive power consumption,
limiting their practicality on resource-constrained platforms. To address this
inefficiency, we propose a predictive, history-aware adaptive scanning
framework that anticipates informative regions of interest (ROI) based on past
observations. Our approach introduces a lightweight predictor network that
distills historical spatial and temporal contexts into refined query
embeddings. These embeddings guide a differentiable Mask Generator network,
which leverages Gumbel-Softmax sampling to produce binary masks identifying
critical ROIs for the upcoming frame. Our method significantly reduces
unnecessary data acquisition by concentrating dense LiDAR scanning only within
these ROIs and sparsely sampling elsewhere. Experiments on nuScenes and Lyft
benchmarks demonstrate that our adaptive scanning strategy reduces LiDAR energy
consumption by over 65% while maintaining competitive or even superior 3D
object detection performance compared to traditional LiDAR-camera fusion
methods with dense LiDAR scanning.

TL;DR: 论文提出LetheViT，一种针对Vision Transformers的对比性遗忘方法，通过选择性掩码实现隐私合规与模型性能的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隐私法规（如GDPR和CCPA）要求用户数据可撤回，需从模型中完全消除其影响，而传统精确遗忘方法计算成本高，需更实用的近似方法。

Method: 通过选择性掩码实验揭示ViTs核心特性，提出LetheViT方法，利用掩码图像生成正对数，原始图像生成负对数，引导模型遗忘特定数据。

Result: LetheViT在实验中表现优异，有效平衡隐私合规与模型性能。

Conclusion: LetheViT为ViTs提供了一种高效的遗忘方法，解决了随机数据遗忘的挑战。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have revolutionized computer vision tasks with
their exceptional performance. However, the introduction of privacy regulations
such as GDPR and CCPA has brought new challenges to them. These laws grant
users the right to withdraw their data, necessitating not only the deletion of
data but also the complete removal of its influence from trained models.
Machine unlearning emerges as a critical solution, with exact unlearning being
computationally prohibitive and approximate methods offering a more practical
approach. This work addresses the particularly challenging scenario of random
data forgetting in ViTs, where the model must forget specific samples while
retaining others, even within the same class. We first reveal the core
characteristics of ViTs through selective masking experiments: when
high-attention areas are masked, the model retains its recognition capability
but significantly weakens its memorization ability. Based on the above
insights, we propose LetheViT, a contrastive unlearning method tailored for
ViTs. LetheViT uses masked image inputs to generate positive logits and
original image inputs to generate negative logits, guiding the model to forget
specific details while retaining the general cl category outlines. Experimental
results demonstrate that LetheViT achieves state-of-the-art performance,
effectively balancing privacy compliance with model efficacy.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为TopoImages的新方法，通过编码图像局部拓扑结构生成新的图像表示，结合深度学习框架显著提升了分类精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法对图像拓扑结构不敏感，而拓扑结构在理解图像内容（如生物医学对象）中至关重要。

Method: 利用持久同调（PH）编码图像局部拓扑特征，生成多视角TopoImages，并与原始图像融合用于深度学习分类。

Result: 在三个公共医学图像分类数据集上，TopoImages方法显著优于现有最优方法。

Conclusion: TopoImages方法具有高度通用性，可无缝集成到常见深度学习框架中，为数据分析提供了新视角。

Abstract: Topological structures in image data, such as connected components and loops,
play a crucial role in understanding image content (e.g., biomedical objects).
% Despite remarkable successes of numerous image processing methods that rely
on appearance information, these methods often lack sensitivity to topological
structures when used in general deep learning (DL) frameworks. % In this paper,
we introduce a new general approach, called TopoImages (for Topology Images),
which computes a new representation of input images by encoding local topology
of patches. % In TopoImages, we leverage persistent homology (PH) to encode
geometric and topological features inherent in image patches. % Our main
objective is to capture topological information in local patches of an input
image into a vectorized form. % Specifically, we first compute persistence
diagrams (PDs) of the patches, % and then vectorize and arrange these PDs into
long vectors for pixels of the patches. % The resulting multi-channel
image-form representation is called a TopoImage. % TopoImages offers a new
perspective for data analysis. % To garner diverse and significant topological
features in image data and ensure a more comprehensive and enriched
representation, we further generate multiple TopoImages of the input image
using various filtration functions, which we call multi-view TopoImages. % The
multi-view TopoImages are fused with the input image for DL-based
classification, with considerable improvement. % Our TopoImages approach is
highly versatile and can be seamlessly integrated into common DL frameworks.
Experiments on three public medical image classification datasets demonstrate
noticeably improved accuracy over state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SECA的统一框架，利用CLIP模型的文本语义先验来解决持续学习中的稳定性-可塑性困境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 持续学习（CL）模型需要在不遗忘旧知识的情况下学习新任务，但现有方法在知识传递中未充分利用语义相关性，导致稳定性与可塑性失衡。

Method: 提出了SECA框架，包含SG-AKT模块（通过文本线索评估新图像与历史知识的语义相关性）和SE-VPR模块（利用文本嵌入的类间语义关系优化视觉原型）。

Result: 在多个基准测试中验证了SECA的有效性。

Conclusion: SECA通过结合文本语义先验，显著提升了持续学习模型的性能，解决了稳定性与可塑性的平衡问题。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) aims to equip models with the ability to learn from a
stream of tasks without forgetting previous knowledge. With the progress of
vision-language models like Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP),
their promise for CL has attracted increasing attention due to their strong
generalizability. However, the potential of rich textual semantic priors in
CLIP in addressing the stability-plasticity dilemma remains underexplored.
During backbone training, most approaches transfer past knowledge without
considering semantic relevance, leading to interference from unrelated tasks
that disrupt the balance between stability and plasticity. Besides, while
text-based classifiers provide strong generalization, they suffer from limited
plasticity due to the inherent modality gap in CLIP. Visual classifiers help
bridge this gap, but their prototypes lack rich and precise semantics. To
address these challenges, we propose Semantic-Enriched Continual Adaptation
(SECA), a unified framework that harnesses the anti-forgetting and structured
nature of textual priors to guide semantic-aware knowledge transfer in the
backbone and reinforce the semantic structure of the visual classifier.
Specifically, a Semantic-Guided Adaptive Knowledge Transfer (SG-AKT) module is
proposed to assess new images' relevance to diverse historical visual knowledge
via textual cues, and aggregate relevant knowledge in an instance-adaptive
manner as distillation signals. Moreover, a Semantic-Enhanced Visual Prototype
Refinement (SE-VPR) module is introduced to refine visual prototypes using
inter-class semantic relations captured in class-wise textual embeddings.
Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our
approach.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Set Pivot Learning（SPL）的新范式，用于基于视觉基础模型（VFMs）的领域泛化（DG），解决了传统DG假设的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统DG假设目标域在训练时不可访问，但VFMs的出现使这一假设变得过时。SPL旨在重新定义领域迁移任务，以适应现代研究和应用需求。

Method: SPL提出动态适应和VFM中心调优，结合动态提示微调方法（Dynamic Prompt Fine-Tuning），通过动态类感知提示器和提示引导的特征聚焦器优化模型性能。

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于现有技术，尤其在广义分割任务中表现突出。

Conclusion: SPL为领域泛化提供了更灵活和适应性的解决方案，特别适合VFMs的应用场景。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce, for the first time, the concept of Set Pivot
Learning, a paradigm shift that redefines domain generalization (DG) based on
Vision Foundation Models (VFMs). Traditional DG assumes that the target domain
is inaccessible during training, but the emergence of VFMs, trained on vast and
diverse data, renders this assumption unclear and obsolete. Traditional DG
assumes that the target domain is inaccessible during training, but the
emergence of VFMs, which are trained on vast and diverse datasets, renders this
assumption unclear and obsolete. To address this challenge, we propose Set
Pivot Learning (SPL), a new definition of domain migration task based on VFMs,
which is more suitable for current research and application requirements.
Unlike conventional DG methods, SPL prioritizes adaptive refinement over rigid
domain transfer, ensuring continuous alignment with evolving real-world
conditions. Specifically, SPL features two key attributes: (i) Dynamic
adaptation, transitioning from static domain alignment to flexible, task-driven
feature optimization, enabling models to evolve with downstream scenarios; (ii)
VFM-centric tuning, leveraging pretrained knowledge as a pivot to hone
task-specific representations while preserving cross-domain robustness.
Building on SPL, we propose a Dynamic Prompt Fine-Tuning method, which combines
a Dynamic Class-aware Prompter with a Prompt-guided Feature Focuser, to elevate
VFM performance in targeted scenarios. Extensive experiments on benchmark
datasets show the effectiveness of our method, highlighting its superiority
over state-of-the-art methods, particularly in generalized segmentation.

Motivation: 现有方法在生成复杂人体运动序列时难以捕捉连续时间动态和灵活性，且易出现模式崩溃。

Result: 在Human3.6M和HumanEva-I数据集上，STCN在多样性和准确性上表现优异。

Conclusion: STCN通过两阶段设计和锚点集策略，有效提升了随机人体运动预测的性能。

Abstract: Stochastic Human Motion Prediction (HMP) has received increasing attention
due to its wide applications. Despite the rapid progress in generative fields,
existing methods often face challenges in learning continuous temporal dynamics
and predicting stochastic motion sequences. They tend to overlook the
flexibility inherent in complex human motions and are prone to mode collapse.
To alleviate these issues, we propose a novel method called STCN, for
stochastic and continuous human motion prediction, which consists of two
stages. Specifically, in the first stage, we propose a spatio-temporal
continuous network to generate smoother human motion sequences. In addition,
the anchor set is innovatively introduced into the stochastic HMP task to
prevent mode collapse, which refers to the potential human motion patterns. In
the second stage, STCN endeavors to acquire the Gaussian mixture distribution
(GMM) of observed motion sequences with the aid of the anchor set. It also
focuses on the probability associated with each anchor, and employs the
strategy of sampling multiple sequences from each anchor to alleviate
intra-class differences in human motions. Experimental results on two
widely-used datasets (Human3.6M and HumanEva-I) demonstrate that our model
obtains competitive performance on both diversity and accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在终身行人重识别中，传统重放方法需要存储历史样本，引发隐私问题；而免样本方法则因遗忘特定知识导致性能下降。

Method: 通过将多个真实图像的训练特征蒸馏为单张图像，生成像素级变化的压缩样本，并在风格重放阶段进行双重对齐。

Result: 实验表明，Pr²R在多个基准测试中显著提升了重放效果，准确率比现有方法高出4%和6%。

Conclusion: Pr²R在保护数据隐私的同时，有效缓解了领域偏移和遗忘问题，提升了终身学习的性能。

Abstract: Lifelong person re-identification (LReID) aims to incrementally accumulate
knowledge across a sequence of tasks under domain shifts. Recently,
replay-based methods have demonstrated strong effectiveness in LReID by
rehearsing past samples stored in an auxiliary memory. However, storing
historical exemplars raises concerns over data privacy. To avoid this,
exemplar-free approaches attempt to match the distribution of past data without
storing raw samples. Despite being privacy-friendly, these methods often suffer
from performance degradation due to the forgetting of specific past knowledge
representations. To this end, we propose to condense information from
sequential data into the pixel space in the replay memory, enabling
Privacy-Preserving Replay (Pr^2R). More specifically, by distilling the
training characteristics of multiple real images into a single image, the
condensed samples undergo pixel-level changes. This not only protects the
privacy of the original data but also makes the replay samples more
representative for sequential tasks. During the style replay phase, we align
the current domain to the previous one while simultaneously adapting the replay
samples to match the style of the current domain. This dual-alignment strategy
effectively mitigates both class-incremental challenges and forgetting caused
by domain shifts. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that the
proposed method significantly improves replay effectiveness while preserving
data privacy. Specifically, Pr^2R achieves 4% and 6% higher accuracy on
sequential tasks compared to the current state-of-the-art and other
replay-based methods, respectively.

Motivation: 传统方法依赖预训练特征，无法动态优化异常检测。SNARM通过自参考学习提升异常判别能力。

Method: 通过计算测试图像块与训练特征库的残差，生成自参考块并计算内部残差，结合Mamba模块动态聚焦异常区域。

Result: 在MVTec AD、MVTec 3D和VisA基准测试中，SNARM在所有指标上均达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: SNARM通过动态自参考学习和Mamba模块，显著提升了工业异常检测的性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose Self-Navigated Residual Mamba (SNARM), a novel
framework for universal industrial anomaly detection that leverages
``self-referential learning'' within test images to enhance anomaly
discrimination. Unlike conventional methods that depend solely on pre-trained
features from normal training data, SNARM dynamically refines anomaly detection
by iteratively comparing test patches against adaptively selected in-image
references. Specifically, we first compute the ``inter-residuals'' features by
contrasting test image patches with the training feature bank. Patches
exhibiting small-norm residuals (indicating high normality) are then utilized
as self-generated reference patches to compute ``intra-residuals'', amplifying
discriminative signals. These inter- and intra-residual features are
concatenated and fed into a novel Mamba module with multiple heads, which are
dynamically navigated by residual properties to focus on anomalous regions.
Finally, AD results are obtained by aggregating the outputs of a self-navigated
Mamba in an ensemble learning paradigm. Extensive experiments on MVTec AD,
MVTec 3D, and VisA benchmarks demonstrate that SNARM achieves state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance, with notable improvements in all metrics, including
Image-AUROC, Pixel-AURC, PRO, and AP.

Conclusion: DMTrack通过双适配器设计显著提升了多模态跟踪的性能和效率。

Abstract: In this paper, we explore adapter tuning and introduce a novel dual-adapter
architecture for spatio-temporal multimodal tracking, dubbed DMTrack. The key
of our DMTrack lies in two simple yet effective modules, including a
spatio-temporal modality adapter (STMA) and a progressive modality
complementary adapter (PMCA) module. The former, applied to each modality
alone, aims to adjust spatio-temporal features extracted from a frozen backbone
by self-prompting, which to some extent can bridge the gap between different
modalities and thus allows better cross-modality fusion. The latter seeks to
facilitate cross-modality prompting progressively with two specially designed
pixel-wise shallow and deep adapters. The shallow adapter employs shared
parameters between the two modalities, aiming to bridge the information flow
between the two modality branches, thereby laying the foundation for following
modality fusion, while the deep adapter modulates the preliminarily fused
information flow with pixel-wise inner-modal attention and further generates
modality-aware prompts through pixel-wise inter-modal attention. With such
designs, DMTrack achieves promising spatio-temporal multimodal tracking
performance with merely \textbf{0.93M} trainable parameters. Extensive
experiments on five benchmarks show that DMTrack achieves state-of-the-art
results. Code will be available.

Result: 在多个多模态医学数据集上表现优于现有方法，并能轻松集成到其他模型中。

Conclusion: CLIMD为提升多模态疾病诊断准确性提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Clinicians usually combine information from multiple sources to achieve the
most accurate diagnosis, and this has sparked increasing interest in leveraging
multimodal deep learning for diagnosis. However, in real clinical scenarios,
due to differences in incidence rates, multimodal medical data commonly face
the issue of class imbalance, which makes it difficult to adequately learn the
features of minority classes. Most existing methods tackle this issue with
resampling or loss reweighting, but they are prone to overfitting or
underfitting and fail to capture cross-modal interactions. Therefore, we
propose a Curriculum Learning framework for Imbalanced Multimodal Diagnosis
(CLIMD). Specifically, we first design multimodal curriculum measurer that
combines two indicators, intra-modal confidence and inter-modal
complementarity, to enable the model to focus on key samples and gradually
adapt to complex category distributions. Additionally, a class
distribution-guided training scheduler is introduced, which enables the model
to progressively adapt to the imbalanced class distribution during training.
Extensive experiments on multiple multimodal medical datasets demonstrate that
the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across various
metrics and excels in handling imbalanced multimodal medical data. Furthermore,
as a plug-and-play CL framework, CLIMD can be easily integrated into other
models, offering a promising path for improving multimodal disease diagnosis
accuracy. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/KHan-UJS/CLIMD.

Result: 在多个公共病理数据集（如EBRAINS和TCGA）上的实验表明，FG-PAN在零样本脑肿瘤亚型分类中实现了最先进的性能和鲁棒泛化能力。

Conclusion: FG-PAN通过视觉与语义空间的对齐，显著提升了细粒度分类性能，为数字病理学中的零样本分类提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The fine-grained classification of brain tumor subtypes from
histopathological whole slide images is highly challenging due to subtle
morphological variations and the scarcity of annotated data. Although
vision-language models have enabled promising zero-shot classification, their
ability to capture fine-grained pathological features remains limited,
resulting in suboptimal subtype discrimination. To address these challenges, we
propose the Fine-Grained Patch Alignment Network (FG-PAN), a novel zero-shot
framework tailored for digital pathology. FG-PAN consists of two key modules:
(1) a local feature refinement module that enhances patch-level visual features
by modeling spatial relationships among representative patches, and (2) a
fine-grained text description generation module that leverages large language
models to produce pathology-aware, class-specific semantic prototypes. By
aligning refined visual features with LLM-generated fine-grained descriptions,
FG-PAN effectively increases class separability in both visual and semantic
spaces. Extensive experiments on multiple public pathology datasets, including
EBRAINS and TCGA, demonstrate that FG-PAN achieves state-of-the-art performance
and robust generalization in zero-shot brain tumor subtype classification.

Result: 在UniversalFakeDetect和GenImage数据集上分别达到95.61%和96.7%的平均准确率。

Conclusion: IAPL通过自适应调整输入提示，显著提升了检测性能，适用于多种伪造图像。

Abstract: A major struggle for AI-generated image detection is identifying fake images
from unseen generators. Existing cutting-edge methods typically customize
pre-trained foundation models to this task via partial-parameter fine-tuning.
However, these parameters trained on a narrow range of generators may fail to
generalize to unknown sources. In light of this, we propose a novel framework
named Image-Adaptive Prompt Learning (IAPL), which enhances flexibility in
processing diverse testing images. It consists of two adaptive modules, i.e.,
the Conditional Information Learner and the Confidence-Driven Adaptive
Prediction. The former employs CNN-based feature extractors to learn
forgery-specific and image-specific conditions, which are then propagated to
learnable tokens via a gated mechanism. The latter optimizes the shallowest
learnable tokens based on a single test sample and selects the cropped view
with the highest prediction confidence for final detection. These two modules
enable the prompts fed into the foundation model to be automatically adjusted
based on the input image, rather than being fixed after training, thereby
enhancing the model's adaptability to various forged images. Extensive
experiments show that IAPL achieves state-of-the-art performance, with 95.61%
and 96.7% mean accuracy on two widely used UniversalFakeDetect and GenImage
datasets, respectively.

Abstract: Image geolocalization, the task of identifying the geographic location
depicted in an image, is important for applications in crisis response, digital

language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for visual reasoning, their
ability to perform image geolocalization remains underexplored. In this study,
we introduce a benchmark called IMAGEO-Bench that systematically evaluates
accuracy, distance error, geospatial bias, and reasoning process. Our benchmark
includes three diverse datasets covering global street scenes, points of
interest (POIs) in the United States, and a private collection of unseen
images. Through experiments on 10 state-of-the-art LLMs, including both open-
and closed-source models, we reveal clear performance disparities, with
closed-source models generally showing stronger reasoning. Importantly, we
uncover geospatial biases as LLMs tend to perform better in high-resource
regions (e.g., North America, Western Europe, and California) while exhibiting
degraded performance in underrepresented areas. Regression diagnostics
demonstrate that successful geolocalization is primarily dependent on
recognizing urban settings, outdoor environments, street-level imagery, and
identifiable landmarks. Overall, IMAGEO-Bench provides a rigorous lens into the
spatial reasoning capabilities of LLMs and offers implications for building
geolocation-aware AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 填补生物医学领域中掩码扩散模型应用的空白，提升视觉语言模型在生物医学图像理解中的性能。

Method: 采用大型语言扩散模型LLaDA-MedV，通过视觉指令调整进行训练，优化初始化权重选择、微调策略及采样步骤与响应重复的交互。

Result: 在开放式的生物医学视觉对话任务中，LLaDA-MedV相对性能提升显著，并在三项VQA基准测试中创下最高准确率。

Conclusion: LLaDA-MedV在生物医学图像理解中表现出色，通过控制响应长度生成更丰富的信息，为相关领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Autoregressive models (ARMs) have long dominated the landscape of biomedical
vision-language models (VLMs). Recently, masked diffusion models such as LLaDA
have emerged as promising alternatives, yet their application in the biomedical
domain remains largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce
\textbf{LLaDA-MedV}, the first large language diffusion model tailored for
biomedical image understanding through vision instruction tuning. LLaDA-MedV
achieves relative performance gains of 7.855\% over LLaVA-Med and 1.867\% over
LLaDA-V in the open-ended biomedical visual conversation task, and sets new
state-of-the-art accuracy on the closed-form subset of three VQA benchmarks:
84.93\% on VQA-RAD, 92.31\% on SLAKE, and 95.15\% on PathVQA. Furthermore, a
detailed comparison with LLaVA-Med suggests that LLaDA-MedV is capable of
generating reasonably longer responses by explicitly controlling response
length, which can lead to more informative outputs. We also conduct an in-depth
analysis of both the training and inference stages, highlighting the critical
roles of initialization weight selection, fine-tuning strategies, and the
interplay between sampling steps and response repetition. The code and model
weight is released at https://github.com/LLM-VLM-GSL/LLaDA-MedV.

*Wanhao Ma,Wei Zhang,Shuai Wan,Fuzheng Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合深度学习与G-PCC标准的新预处理框架，显著提升压缩效率，同时保持兼容性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: G-PCC标准虽然通用且低功耗，但压缩效率不及深度学习方法。需提升其效率而不牺牲兼容性。

Method: 集成压缩导向的体素化网络与可微G-PCC替代模型，联合优化训练。替代模型模拟G-PCC的率失真行为，支持端到端梯度传播。

Result: 实验显示平均BD-rate降低38.84%，显著提升G-PCC效率。

Conclusion: 该框架为增强传统压缩标准提供了实用途径，保持向后兼容性，适合实际部署。

Abstract: Geometry-based point cloud compression (G-PCC), an international standard
designed by MPEG, provides a generic framework for compressing diverse types of
point clouds while ensuring interoperability across applications and devices.
However, G-PCC underperforms compared to recent deep learning-based PCC methods
despite its lower computational power consumption. To enhance the efficiency of
G-PCC without sacrificing its interoperability or computational flexibility, we
propose a novel preprocessing framework that integrates a compression-oriented
voxelization network with a differentiable G-PCC surrogate model, jointly
optimized in the training phase. The surrogate model mimics the rate-distortion
behaviour of the non-differentiable G-PCC codec, enabling end-to-end gradient
propagation. The versatile voxelization network adaptively transforms input
point clouds using learning-based voxelization and effectively manipulates
point clouds via global scaling, fine-grained pruning, and point-level editing
for rate-distortion trade-offs. During inference, only the lightweight
voxelization network is appended to the G-PCC encoder, requiring no
modifications to the decoder, thus introducing no computational overhead for
end users. Extensive experiments demonstrate a 38.84% average BD-rate reduction
over G-PCC. By bridging classical codecs with deep learning, this work offers a
practical pathway to enhance legacy compression standards while preserving
their backward compatibility, making it ideal for real-world deployment.

Abstract: We address the problem of glass surface segmentation with an RGB-D camera,
with a focus on effectively fusing RGB and depth information. To this end, we
propose a Weighted Feature Fusion (WFF) module that dynamically and adaptively
combines RGB and depth features to tackle issues such as transparency,
reflections, and occlusions. This module can be seamlessly integrated with
various deep neural network backbones as a plug-and-play solution.
Additionally, we introduce the MJU-Glass dataset, a comprehensive RGB-D dataset
collected by a service robot navigating real-world environments, providing a
valuable benchmark for evaluating segmentation models. Experimental results
show significant improvements in segmentation accuracy and robustness, with the
WFF module enhancing performance in both mean Intersection over Union (mIoU)
and boundary IoU (bIoU), achieving a 7.49% improvement in bIoU when integrated
with PSPNet. The proposed module and dataset provide a robust framework for
advancing glass surface segmentation in robotics and reducing the risk of
collisions with glass objects.

*Yujian Liu,Yuechuan Lin,Dongxu Shen,Haoran Li,Yutong Wang,Xiaoli Liu,Shidang Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CDSR的双尺度重建框架，通过选择最具信息量的高分辨率补丁，显著提高了全切片图像分析的效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全切片图像（WSI）分析面临高分辨率和稀疏诊断区域的挑战，现有方法因特征提取器的局限性导致性能不佳。

Method: CDSR采用两阶段选择性采样策略和局部到全局网络，仅需少量高分辨率补丁即可重建WSI表示。

Result: 在多个数据集上，CDSR以少量补丁（平均7070个）实现了6.3%的准确率和5.5%的ROC曲线下面积提升。

Conclusion: CDSR在效率和形态保真度上优于现有方法，为WSI分析提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Whole-slide image (WSI) analysis remains challenging due to the gigapixel
scale and sparsely distributed diagnostic regions. Multiple Instance Learning
(MIL) mitigates this by modeling the WSI as bags of patches for slide-level
prediction. However, most MIL approaches emphasize aggregator design while
overlooking the impact of the feature extractor of the feature extraction
stage, which is often pretrained on natural images. This leads to domain gap
and suboptimal representations. Self-supervised learning (SSL) has shown
promise in bridging domain gap via pretext tasks, but it still primarily builds
upon generic backbones, thus requiring WSIs to be split into small patches.
This inevitably splits histological structures and generates both redundant and
interdependent patches, which in turn degrades aggregator performance and
drastically increases training costs. To address this challenge, we propose a
Cascaded Dual-Scale Reconstruction (CDSR) framework, demonstrating that only an
average of 9 high-resolution patches per WSI are sufficient for robust
slide-level representation. CDSR employs a two-stage selective sampling
strategy that identifies the most informative representative regions from both
model-based and semantic perspectives. These patches are then fed into a
Local-to-Global Network, which reconstructs spatially coherent high-resolution
WSI representations by integrating fine-grained local detail with global
contextual information. Unlike existing dense-sampling or SSL pipelines, CDSR
is optimized for efficiency and morphological fidelity. Experiments on
Camelyon16, TCGA-NSCLC, and TCGA-RCC demonstrate that CDSR achieves
improvements of 6.3% in accuracy and 5.5% in area under ROC curve on downstream
classification tasks with only 7,070 (4.5% of total) high-resolution patches
per dataset on average, outperforming state-of-the-art methods trained on over
10,000,000 patches.

Abstract: Realistic hair strand generation is crucial for applications like computer
graphics and virtual reality. While diffusion models can generate hairstyles
from text or images, these inputs lack precision and user-friendliness.
Instead, we propose the first sketch-based strand generation model, which
offers finer control while remaining user-friendly. Our framework tackles key
challenges, such as modeling complex strand interactions and diverse sketch
patterns, through two main innovations: a learnable strand upsampling strategy
that encodes 3D strands into multi-scale latent spaces, and a multi-scale
adaptive conditioning mechanism using a transformer with diffusion heads to
ensure consistency across granularity levels. Experiments on several benchmark
datasets show our method outperforms existing approaches in realism and
precision. Qualitative results further confirm its effectiveness. Code will be
released at [GitHub](https://github.com/fighting-Zhang/StrandDesigner).

Result: 实验表明，DAG在性能上优于现有方法，并展现出开放世界的泛化能力。

Conclusion: DAG通过扩散模型提取通用可供性知识，显著提升了3D可供性定位的泛化能力。

Abstract: 3D object affordance grounding aims to predict the touchable regions on a 3d
object, which is crucial for human-object interaction, human-robot interaction,
embodied perception, and robot learning. Recent advances tackle this problem
via learning from demonstration images. However, these methods fail to capture
the general affordance knowledge within the image, leading to poor
generalization. To address this issue, we propose to use text-to-image
diffusion models to extract the general affordance knowledge because we find
that such models can generate semantically valid HOI images, which demonstrate
that their internal representation space is highly correlated with real-world
affordance concepts. Specifically, we introduce the DAG, a diffusion-based 3d
affordance grounding framework, which leverages the frozen internal
representations of the text-to-image diffusion model and unlocks affordance
knowledge within the diffusion model to perform 3D affordance grounding. We
further introduce an affordance block and a multi-source affordance decoder to
endow 3D dense affordance prediction. Extensive experimental evaluations show
that our model excels over well-established methods and exhibits open-world
generalization.

Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在多模态任务中表现优异，但仍存在幻觉问题，即生成内容与视觉输入不一致。

Method: 采用层间和层内注意力操作（Layer-Wise Criss-Cross Attention）和全局-局部对数融合机制（Global-Local Logit Fusion）来提升事实一致性。

Result: 在POPE、MME和MMHal-Bench等基准测试中显著提升了模型的真实性和性能。

Conclusion: MAP方法展示了基于地图级解码策略的潜力，有效缓解了幻觉问题。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved impressive performance in
multimodal tasks, but they still suffer from hallucinations, i.e., generating
content that is grammatically accurate but inconsistent with visual inputs. In
this work, we introduce a novel map-level perspective to mitigate
hallucinations in LVLMs, interpreting the hidden states of the model as a 2D
semantic map. We observe that factual information is widely distributed across
this map, extending beyond the localized inter- or intra-layer regions targeted
by most existing methods (e.g., contrastive decoding and layer-wise
consistency). Building on this insight, we propose Map-Level Attention
Processing (MAP), a training-free decoding method that effectively leverages
factual information through attention-based map-level operations to improve
factual consistency. Specifically, we employ Layer-Wise Criss-Cross Attention
to progressively refine token representations at each decoding layer by
aggregating tokens from both inter- and intra-layer dimensions. Additionally, a
Global-Local Logit Fusion mechanism combines logits obtained before and after
global attention to further refine predictions and improve accuracy. Our method
consistently improves the truthfulness and performance of LVLMs across
benchmarks, such as POPE, MME, and MMHal-Bench, demonstrating the potential of
the map-level decoding strategy.

TL;DR: VELA是一种基于点提示的端到端速度驱动水平集Amodal分割方法，通过显式轮廓演化实现遮挡区域的分割，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Amodal分割方法依赖强提示（如可见掩码或边界框），成本高且不实用；同时缺乏几何可解释性。

Method: VELA通过可微分网络预测形状特定运动场，驱动水平集函数从点提示逐步演化为最终Amodal掩码。

Result: 在COCOA-cls、D2SA和KINS基准测试中，VELA仅需单点提示即优于现有强提示方法。

Conclusion: VELA验证了弱提示下可解释几何建模的有效性，代码将公开。

Abstract: Amodal segmentation aims to recover complete object shapes, including
occluded regions with no visual appearance, whereas conventional segmentation
focuses solely on visible areas. Existing methods typically rely on strong
prompts, such as visible masks or bounding boxes, which are costly or
impractical to obtain in real-world settings. While recent approaches such as
the Segment Anything Model (SAM) support point-based prompts for guidance, they
often perform direct mask regression without explicitly modeling shape
evolution, limiting generalization in complex occlusion scenarios. Moreover,
most existing methods suffer from a black-box nature, lacking geometric
interpretability and offering limited insight into how occluded shapes are
inferred. To deal with these limitations, we propose VELA, an end-to-end
VElocity-driven Level-set Amodal segmentation method that performs explicit
contour evolution from point-based prompts. VELA first constructs an initial
level set function from image features and the point input, which then
progressively evolves into the final amodal mask under the guidance of a
shape-specific motion field predicted by a fully differentiable network. This
network learns to generate evolution dynamics at each step, enabling
geometrically grounded and topologically flexible contour modeling. Extensive
experiments on COCOA-cls, D2SA, and KINS benchmarks demonstrate that VELA
outperforms existing strongly prompted methods while requiring only a
single-point prompt, validating the effectiveness of interpretable geometric
modeling under weak guidance. The code will be publicly released.

Motivation: 现有方法在处理多样化的模态形状时表现不佳，因为单一模型难以捕捉复杂的形状变化和遮挡关系。

Method: ShapeMoE通过学习潜在形状分布空间，动态将对象路由到适合其形状特征的轻量级专家，每个专家专注于特定形状模式的遮挡区域预测。

Result: 在COCOA-cls、KINS和D2SA数据集上，ShapeMoE在遮挡区域分割任务中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ShapeMoE通过形状感知的动态路由和专家设计，实现了高效且高性能的模态分割。

Abstract: Amodal segmentation targets to predict complete object masks, covering both
visible and occluded regions. This task poses significant challenges due to
complex occlusions and extreme shape variation, from rigid furniture to highly
deformable clothing. Existing one-size-fits-all approaches rely on a single
model to handle all shape types, struggling to capture and reason about diverse
amodal shapes due to limited representation capacity. A natural solution is to
adopt a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework, assigning experts to different
shape patterns. However, naively applying MoE without considering the object's
underlying shape distribution can lead to mismatched expert routing and
insufficient expert specialization, resulting in redundant or underutilized
experts. To deal with these issues, we introduce ShapeMoE, a shape-specific
sparse Mixture-of-Experts framework for amodal segmentation. The key idea is to
learn a latent shape distribution space and dynamically route each object to a
lightweight expert tailored to its shape characteristics. Specifically,
ShapeMoE encodes each object into a compact Gaussian embedding that captures
key shape characteristics. A Shape-Aware Sparse Router then maps the object to
the most suitable expert, enabling precise and efficient shape-aware expert
routing. Each expert is designed as lightweight and specialized in predicting
occluded regions for specific shape patterns. ShapeMoE offers well
interpretability via clear shape-to-expert correspondence, while maintaining
high capacity and efficiency. Experiments on COCOA-cls, KINS, and D2SA show
that ShapeMoE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in
occluded region segmentation. The code will be released.

Motivation: VFMs在语义分割中的应用受限于数据规模差异和域分布偏移，Rein++旨在解决这些问题。

Method: Rein++包含Rein-G（实例感知令牌微调）和Rein-A（实例和逻辑层面的无监督域适应），结合语义转移模块增强边界细节。

Result: Rein++在高效训练下显著优于现有方法，适用于大规模模型。

Conclusion: Rein++是一个高效、泛化性强且适应性强的VFM分割解决方案。

Abstract: Vision Foundation Models(VFMs) have achieved remarkable success in various
computer vision tasks. However, their application to semantic segmentation is
hindered by two significant challenges: (1) the disparity in data scale, as
segmentation datasets are typically much smaller than those used for VFM
pre-training, and (2) domain distribution shifts, where real-world segmentation
scenarios are diverse and often underrepresented during pre-training. To
overcome these limitations, we present Rein++, an efficient VFM-based
segmentation framework that demonstrates superior generalization from limited
data and enables effective adaptation to diverse unlabeled scenarios.
Specifically, Rein++ comprises a domain generalization solution Rein-G and a
domain adaptation solution Rein-A. Rein-G introduces a set of trainable,
instance-aware tokens that effectively refine the VFM's features for the
segmentation task. This parameter-efficient approach fine-tunes less than 1% of
the backbone's parameters, enabling robust generalization. Building on the
Rein-G, Rein-A performs unsupervised domain adaptation at both the instance and
logit levels to mitigate domain shifts. In addition, it incorporates a semantic
transfer module that leverages the class-agnostic capabilities of the segment
anything model to enhance boundary details in the target domain. The integrated
Rein++ pipeline first learns a generalizable model on a source domain (e.g.,
daytime scenes) and subsequently adapts it to diverse target domains (e.g.,
nighttime scenes) without any target labels. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate that Rein++ significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods with
efficient training, underscoring its roles an efficient, generalizable, and
adaptive segmentation solution for VFMs, even for large models with billions of
parameters. The code is available at https://github.com/wloves/Rein.

Motivation: 对抗补丁攻击威胁现代视觉模型的可靠性，需要系统评估补丁放置的影响。

Method: 提出PatchMap基准，并设计一种基于分割的启发式方法，利用现成分割掩模识别易受攻击区域，无需梯度查询。

Result: 在五种架构（包括对抗训练的ResNet50）上，该方法比随机或固定放置的攻击成功率提高8-13个百分点。

Conclusion: PatchMap及其代码公开，未来将发布完整基准（6.5B预测，多骨干网络），推动位置感知防御和自适应攻击研究。

Abstract: Adversarial patch attacks threaten the reliability of modern vision models.
We present PatchMap, the first spatially exhaustive benchmark of patch
placement, built by evaluating over 1.5e8 forward passes on ImageNet validation
images. PatchMap reveals systematic hot-spots where small patches (as little as
2% of the image) induce confident misclassifications and large drops in model
confidence. To demonstrate its utility, we propose a simple segmentation guided
placement heuristic that leverages off the shelf masks to identify vulnerable
regions without any gradient queries. Across five architectures-including
adversarially trained ResNet50, our method boosts attack success rates by 8 to
13 percentage points compared to random or fixed placements. We publicly
release PatchMap and the code implementation. The full PatchMap bench (6.5B
predictions, multiple backbones) will be released soon to further accelerate
research on location-aware defenses and adaptive attacks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉语言模型（VLMs）因多模态信息对齐困难导致的幻觉问题。

Method: 提出Prompt-in-Image方法，将文本指令直接嵌入图像，强制模型通过视觉通道处理所有内容。

Result: Qwen2.5-VL性能提升（POPE准确率提高4.1%），而LLaVA-1.5和InstructBLIP性能大幅下降。

Conclusion: Prompt-in-Image方法对某些VLMs有效，但需注意模型视觉编码器的适应性。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often suffer from hallucination, partly due to
challenges in aligning multimodal information. We propose Prompt-in-Image, a
simple method that embeds textual instructions directly into images. This
removes the need for separate text inputs and forces the model to process all
content through the visual channel. We evaluate this method on three popular
open-source VLMs: Qwen2.5-VL, LLaVA-1.5, and InstructBLIP. The results reveal
sharp differences. Prompt-in-Image improves Qwen2.5-VL's performance,
increasing POPE accuracy by 4.1 percent (from 80.2 percent to 84.3 percent) and
also reducing hallucination rates on MS-COCO. In contrast, LLaVA-1.5 and
InstructBLIP experience a severe performance drop, with accuracy falling from
around 84 percent to near-random levels. Through detailed analysis, we found
that CLIP-based encoders in LLaVA and InstructBLIP exhibit excessive attention
bias toward embedded text regions, disrupting visual understanding. In
contrast, Qwen's vision encoder handles text-embedded images robustly.
Crucially, Prompt-in-Image reduces Qwen's modality gap, enhancing cross-modal
alignment by unifying information processing through a single modality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在2D图像生成和编辑中表现出色，但在3D编辑中保持多视角一致性仍具挑战性。现有方法存在收敛慢、模糊伪影和细粒度不一致等问题。

Method: DisCo3D首先用多视角输入微调3D生成器以适应场景，然后通过一致性蒸馏训练2D编辑器，最后通过高斯泼溅优化编辑后的多视角输出为3D表示。

Result: 实验表明，DisCo3D实现了稳定的多视角一致性，并在编辑质量上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DisCo3D通过结合3D一致性先验和2D编辑，显著提升了3D编辑的效果和效率。

Abstract: While diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable progress in 2D image
generation and editing, extending these capabilities to 3D editing remains
challenging, particularly in maintaining multi-view consistency. Classical
approaches typically update 3D representations through iterative refinement
based on a single editing view. However, these methods often suffer from slow
convergence and blurry artifacts caused by cross-view inconsistencies. Recent
methods improve efficiency by propagating 2D editing attention features, yet
still exhibit fine-grained inconsistencies and failure modes in complex scenes
due to insufficient constraints. To address this, we propose \textbf{DisCo3D},
a novel framework that distills 3D consistency priors into a 2D editor. Our
method first fine-tunes a 3D generator using multi-view inputs for scene
adaptation, then trains a 2D editor through consistency distillation. The
edited multi-view outputs are finally optimized into 3D representations via
Gaussian Splatting. Experimental results show DisCo3D achieves stable
multi-view consistency and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in editing
quality.

Abstract: Establishing pixel/voxel-level or region-level correspondences is the core
challenge in image registration. The latter, also known as region-based
correspondence representation, leverages paired regions of interest (ROIs) to
enable regional matching while preserving fine-grained capability at
pixel/voxel level. Traditionally, this representation is implemented via two
steps: segmenting ROIs in each image then matching them between the two images.
In this paper, we simplify this into one step by directly "searching for
corresponding prompts", using extensively pre-trained segmentation models
(e.g., SAM) for a training-free registration approach, PromptReg. Firstly, we
introduce the "corresponding prompt problem", which aims to identify a
corresponding Prompt Y in Image Y for any given visual Prompt X in Image X,
such that the two respectively prompt-conditioned segmentations are a pair of
corresponding ROIs from the two images. Secondly, we present an "inverse
prompt" solution that generates primary and optionally auxiliary prompts,
inverting Prompt X into the prompt space of Image Y. Thirdly, we propose a
novel registration algorithm that identifies multiple paired corresponding ROIs
by marginalizing the inverted Prompt X across both prompt and spatial
dimensions. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on five applications of
registering 3D prostate MR, 3D abdomen MR, 3D lung CT, 2D histopathology and,
as a non-medical example, 2D aerial images. Based on metrics including Dice and
target registration errors on anatomical structures, the proposed registration
outperforms both intensity-based iterative algorithms and learning-based
DDF-predicting networks, even yielding competitive performance with
weakly-supervised approaches that require fully-segmented training data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在给定首尾视频帧和文本提示下生成平滑过渡视频的研究不足，VTG旨在填补这一空白。

Method: VTG采用插值初始化、双向运动微调和表示对齐正则化，优化预训练图像到视频扩散模型的运动平滑性和生成保真度。

Result: VTG在概念混合和场景过渡任务中表现优异，实验证明其一致优于其他方法。

Conclusion: VTG为统一过渡生成提供了有效框架，并通过TransitBench基准推动了未来研究。

Abstract: Leveraging text, images, structure maps, or motion trajectories as
conditional guidance, diffusion models have achieved great success in automated
and high-quality video generation. However, generating smooth and rational
transition videos given the first and last video frames as well as descriptive
text prompts is far underexplored. We present VTG, a Versatile Transition video
Generation framework that can generate smooth, high-fidelity, and semantically
coherent video transitions. VTG introduces interpolation-based initialization
that helps preserve object identity and handle abrupt content changes
effectively. In addition, it incorporates dual-directional motion fine-tuning
and representation alignment regularization to mitigate the limitations of
pre-trained image-to-video diffusion models in motion smoothness and generation
fidelity, respectively. To evaluate VTG and facilitate future studies on
unified transition generation, we collected TransitBench, a comprehensive
benchmark for transition generation covering two representative transition
tasks: concept blending and scene transition. Extensive experiments show that
VTG achieves superior transition performance consistently across all four
tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频大语言模型对所有任务标记采用静态处理方式，未能区分时间定位、显著性评估和文本生成等不同任务的需求。

Method: 提出TimeExpert模型，利用Mixture-of-Experts架构动态路由任务特定标记到专用专家模块。

Result: 在密集视频描述、时刻检索和视频高光检测等任务中，TimeExpert实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: TimeExpert通过任务分解和动态路由，显著提升了视频时间定位任务的性能。

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) aims to precisely identify video event
segments in response to textual queries. The outputs of VTG tasks manifest as
sequences of events, each defined by precise timestamps, saliency scores, and
textual descriptions. Despite recent advances, a fundamental limitation
persists in existing Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs): they process all
task tokens through identical and static pathways, failing to recognize that
temporal localization, saliency assessment, and textual generation represent
fundamentally distinct tasks requiring specialized processing. To address this,
we introduce TimeExpert, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based Video-LLM that
effectively decomposes VTG tasks by dynamically routing task-specific tokens
(e.g., timestamps, saliency scores) to specialized experts, with increased
computational efficiency. Our design choices enable precise handling of each
subtask, leading to improved event modeling across diverse VTG applications.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that TimeExpert consistently achieves
state-of-the-art performance on various VTG tasks such as Dense Video
Captioning, Moment Retrieval, and Video Highlight Detection.

Motivation: 由于3D-GS生成高斯场景的时间和计算成本高，地图更新成为挑战。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出LT-Gaussian，包含多模态高斯泼溅、结构变化检测模块和高斯地图更新模块，通过比较旧地图与当前LiDAR数据流进行针对性更新。

Result: 实验表明，LT-Gaussian能高效更新地图，处理自动驾驶场景中的常见环境变化，并生成更高质量的重建结果。

Conclusion: LT-Gaussian通过利用新旧场景信息，优于从头重建地图的策略，代码已开源。

Abstract: Maps play an important role in autonomous driving systems. The recently
proposed 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) produces rendering-quality explicit
scene reconstruction results, demonstrating the potential for map construction
in autonomous driving scenarios. However, because of the time and computational
costs involved in generating Gaussian scenes, how to update the map becomes a
significant challenge. In this paper, we propose LT-Gaussian, a map update
method for 3D-GS-based maps. LT-Gaussian consists of three main components:
Multimodal Gaussian Splatting, Structural Change Detection Module, and
Gaussian-Map Update Module. Firstly, the Gaussian map of the old scene is
generated using our proposed Multimodal Gaussian Splatting. Subsequently,
during the map update process, we compare the outdated Gaussian map with the
current LiDAR data stream to identify structural changes. Finally, we perform
targeted updates to the Gaussian-map to generate an up-to-date map. We
establish a benchmark for map updating on the nuScenes dataset to
quantitatively evaluate our method. The experimental results show that
LT-Gaussian can effectively and efficiently update the Gaussian-map, handling
common environmental changes in autonomous driving scenarios. Furthermore, by
taking full advantage of information from both new and old scenes, LT-Gaussian
is able to produce higher quality reconstruction results compared to map update
strategies that reconstruct maps from scratch. Our open-source code is
available at https://github.com/ChengLuqi/LT-gaussian.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖视觉线索，忽略了音频语义或采用粗粒度融合策略，导致跨模态表示不理想。

Method: GAID包含两个关键组件：(i)帧级门控融合(FGF)，在文本引导下自适应整合视听特征；(ii)方向性自适应语义扰动(DASP)，增强文本嵌入的鲁棒性和区分性。

Result: 在MSR-VTT、DiDeMo、LSMDC和VATEX数据集上，GAID在所有检索指标上均达到SOTA效果，并显著提升效率。

Conclusion: GAID通过融合和扰动模块互补，生成更稳定和表达力强的跨模态表示，显著提升文本-视频检索性能。

Abstract: Text-to-video retrieval requires precise alignment between language and
temporally rich video signals. Existing methods predominantly exploit visual
cues and often overlook complementary audio semantics or adopt coarse fusion
strategies, leading to suboptimal multimodal representations. We present GAID,
a framework that jointly address this gap via two key components: (i) a
Frame-level Gated Fusion (FGF) that adaptively integrates audio and visual
features under textual guidance, enabling fine-grained temporal alignment; and
(ii) a Directional Adaptive Semantic Perturbation (DASP) that injects
structure-aware perturbations into text embeddings, enhancing robustness and
discrimination without incurring multi-pass inference. These modules complement
each other -- fusion reduces modality gaps while perturbation regularizes
cross-modal matching -- yielding more stable and expressive representations.
Extensive experiments on MSR-VTT, DiDeMo, LSMDC, and VATEX show consistent
state-of-the-art results across all retrieval metrics with notable efficiency
gains. Our code is available at https://github.com/YangBowenn/GAID.

Motivation: 深度视觉模型的分布式表示使得定位特定视觉概念的编码位置具有挑战性，需要一种有效的方法来发现相关神经元电路。

Method: 提出Granular Concept Circuit (GCC)方法，通过迭代评估神经元间的功能依赖性和语义对齐，构建与查询概念相关的电路。

Result: GCC方法能够自动发现多个电路，每个电路捕获查询中的特定概念，并在多种深度图像分类模型中验证了其有效性和通用性。

Conclusion: GCC方法首次实现了细粒度视觉概念相关的电路发现，为模型提供了深刻的、概念层面的解释。

Abstract: Deep vision models have achieved remarkable classification performance by
leveraging a hierarchical architecture in which human-interpretable concepts
emerge through the composition of individual neurons across layers. Given the
distributed nature of representations, pinpointing where specific visual
concepts are encoded within a model remains a crucial yet challenging task. In
this paper, we introduce an effective circuit discovery method, called Granular
Concept Circuit (GCC), in which each circuit represents a concept relevant to a
given query. To construct each circuit, our method iteratively assesses
inter-neuron connectivity, focusing on both functional dependencies and
semantic alignment. By automatically discovering multiple circuits, each
capturing specific concepts within that query, our approach offers a profound,
concept-wise interpretation of models and is the first to identify circuits
tied to specific visual concepts at a fine-grained level. We validate the
versatility and effectiveness of GCCs across various deep image classification
models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人机视频中的频繁视角变化和复杂运动导致跟踪不稳定，现有方法未能充分利用外观和运动的时空交互。

Method: 提出AMOT，包含外观-运动一致性矩阵（AMC）和运动感知轨迹延续模块（MTC），联合优化外观和运动线索。

Result: 在VisDrone2019等三个基准测试中，AMOT表现优于现有方法，且无需训练即可即插即用。

Conclusion: AMOT通过外观和运动的联合建模，显著提升了无人机视频的多目标跟踪性能。

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) aims to track multiple objects while maintaining
consistent identities across frames of a given video. In unmanned aerial
vehicle (UAV) recorded videos, frequent viewpoint changes and complex
UAV-ground relative motion dynamics pose significant challenges, which often
lead to unstable affinity measurement and ambiguous association. Existing
methods typically model motion and appearance cues separately, overlooking
their spatio-temporal interplay and resulting in suboptimal tracking
performance. In this work, we propose AMOT, which jointly exploits appearance
and motion cues through two key components: an Appearance-Motion Consistency
(AMC) matrix and a Motion-aware Track Continuation (MTC) module. Specifically,
the AMC matrix computes bi-directional spatial consistency under the guidance
of appearance features, enabling more reliable and context-aware identity
association. The MTC module complements AMC by reactivating unmatched tracks
through appearance-guided predictions that align with Kalman-based predictions,
thereby reducing broken trajectories caused by missed detections. Extensive
experiments on three UAV benchmarks, including VisDrone2019, UAVDT, and
VT-MOT-UAV, demonstrate that our AMOT outperforms current state-of-the-art
methods and generalizes well in a plug-and-play and training-free manner.

Motivation: 解决多光谱/高光谱数据缺乏相应基础模型的问题，探索现有RSFMs能否有效适配不同光谱模态，而无需大量光谱预训练。

Method: 提出SpectralX框架，包括两阶段训练：第一阶段通过掩码重建任务和Hyper Tokenizer提取空间和光谱维度的属性令牌；第二阶段通过Attribute-refined Adapter迭代查询低层语义特征，动态调整模型。

Result: SpectralX能够解释新区域或季节的光谱图像，显著提升领域泛化性能。

Conclusion: SpectralX为多光谱/高光谱数据的处理提供了一种高效的适配方法，无需大量预训练即可实现领域泛化。

Abstract: Recent advances in Remote Sensing Foundation Models (RSFMs) have led to
significant breakthroughs in the field. While many RSFMs have been pretrained
with massive optical imagery, more multispectral/hyperspectral data remain lack
of the corresponding foundation models. To leverage the advantages of spectral
imagery in earth observation, we explore whether existing RSFMs can be
effectively adapted to process diverse spectral modalities without requiring
extensive spectral pretraining. In response to this challenge, we proposed
SpectralX, an innovative parameter-efficient fine-tuning framework that adapt
existing RSFMs as backbone while introducing a two-stage training approach to
handle various spectral inputs, thereby significantly improving domain
generalization performance. In the first stage, we employ a
masked-reconstruction task and design a specialized Hyper Tokenizer (HyperT) to
extract attribute tokens from both spatial and spectral dimensions.
Simultaneously, we develop an Attribute-oriented Mixture of Adapter (AoMoA)
that dynamically aggregates multi-attribute expert knowledge while performing
layer-wise fine-tuning. With semantic segmentation as downstream task in the
second stage, we insert an Attribute-refined Adapter (Are-adapter) into the
first stage framework. By iteratively querying low-level semantic features with
high-level representations, the model learns to focus on task-beneficial
attributes, enabling customized adjustment of RSFMs. Following this two-phase
adaptation process, SpectralX is capable of interpreting spectral imagery from
new regions or seasons. The codes will be available from the website:

Conclusion: AG$^2$aussian通过锚点图结构有效解决了现有方法的噪声和混乱问题，为多种应用提供了高效支持。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has witnessed exponential adoption across
diverse applications, driving a critical need for semantic-aware 3D Gaussian
representations to enable scene understanding and editing tasks. Existing
approaches typically attach semantic features to a collection of free Gaussians
and distill the features via differentiable rendering, leading to noisy
segmentation and a messy selection of Gaussians. In this paper, we introduce
AG$^2$aussian, a novel framework that leverages an anchor-graph structure to
organize semantic features and regulate Gaussian primitives. Our anchor-graph
structure not only promotes compact and instance-aware Gaussian distributions,
but also facilitates graph-based propagation, achieving a clean and accurate
instance-level Gaussian selection. Extensive validation across four
applications, i.e. interactive click-based query, open-vocabulary text-driven
query, object removal editing, and physics simulation, demonstrates the
advantages of our approach and its benefits to various applications. The
experiments and ablation studies further evaluate the effectiveness of the key
designs of our approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于揭示开源视觉语言模型（VLM）微调后可能保留的漏洞，这些漏洞使其易受可转移的越狱攻击。

Method: 方法包括模拟微调轨迹（FTS）和定向提示引导（TPG），前者模拟视觉编码器的参数变化生成对抗图像，后者引导语言解码器输出对抗性内容。

Result: 实验表明，SEA在Qwen2-VL家族（2B和7B）上实现了超过86.5%的转移攻击成功率和接近49.5%的毒性率。

Conclusion: 结论强调了保护微调专有VLM免受开源基础模型漏洞影响的紧迫性，并呼吁开发全生命周期的防御措施。

Abstract: Fine-tuning open-source Vision-Language Models (VLMs) creates a critical yet
underexplored attack surface: vulnerabilities in the base VLM could be retained
in fine-tuned variants, rendering them susceptible to transferable jailbreak
attacks. To demonstrate this risk, we introduce the Simulated Ensemble Attack
(SEA), a novel grey-box jailbreak method in which the adversary has full access
to the base VLM but no knowledge of the fine-tuned target's weights or training
configuration. To improve jailbreak transferability across fine-tuned VLMs, SEA
combines two key techniques: Fine-tuning Trajectory Simulation (FTS) and
Targeted Prompt Guidance (TPG). FTS generates transferable adversarial images
by simulating the vision encoder's parameter shifts, while TPG is a textual
strategy that steers the language decoder toward adversarially optimized
outputs. Experiments on the Qwen2-VL family (2B and 7B) demonstrate that SEA
achieves high transfer attack success rates exceeding 86.5% and toxicity rates
near 49.5% across diverse fine-tuned variants, even those specifically
fine-tuned to improve safety behaviors. Notably, while direct PGD-based image
jailbreaks rarely transfer across fine-tuned VLMs, SEA reliably exploits
inherited vulnerabilities from the base model, significantly enhancing
transferability. These findings highlight an urgent need to safeguard
fine-tuned proprietary VLMs against transferable vulnerabilities inherited from
open-source foundations, motivating the development of holistic defenses across
the entire model lifecycle.

Conclusion: INSIGHT通过结合语义特征和认知推理，显著提升了长期动作预测的准确性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Long-term action anticipation from egocentric video is critical for
applications such as human-computer interaction and assistive technologies,
where anticipating user intent enables proactive and context-aware AI
assistance. However, existing approaches suffer from three key limitations: 1)
underutilization of fine-grained visual cues from hand-object interactions, 2)
neglect of semantic dependencies between verbs and nouns, and 3) lack of
explicit cognitive reasoning, limiting generalization and long-term forecasting
ability. To overcome these challenges, we propose INSIGHT, a unified two-stage
framework for egocentric action anticipation. In the first stage, INSIGHT
focuses on extracting semantically rich features from hand-object interaction
regions and enhances action representations using a verb-noun co-occurrence
matrix. In the second stage, it introduces a reinforcement learning-based
module that simulates explicit cognitive reasoning through a structured
process: visual perception (think) -> intention inference (reason) -> action
anticipation (answer). Extensive experiments on Ego4D, EPIC-Kitchens-55, and
EGTEA Gaze+ benchmarks show that INSIGHT achieves state-of-the-art performance,
demonstrating its effectiveness and strong generalization capability.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新框架，通过解耦采样与优化过程并改进信号质量，显著提升了隐私保护数据集蒸馏的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代机器学习模型依赖大量敏感数据，隐私保护成为关键问题。差分隐私数据生成虽能保护隐私，但需要大量数据且效率低。数据集蒸馏（DD）因其高效性成为解决方案，但现有方法存在采样-优化同步问题和噪声训练信号依赖，导致隐私信息利用不足。

Method: 提出了一种新框架，解耦采样与优化过程，通过在信息子空间匹配减少差分隐私噪声的影响，提升信号质量和收敛性。

Result: 在CIFAR-10上，新方法在每类50张图像时性能提升10.0%，且仅需先前方法五分之一的数据量即可实现8.3%的提升。

Conclusion: 该框架显著提升了隐私保护数据集蒸馏的效率与性能，具有重要应用潜力。

Abstract: Modern machine learning models heavily rely on large datasets that often
include sensitive and private information, raising serious privacy concerns.
Differentially private (DP) data generation offers a solution by creating
synthetic datasets that limit the leakage of private information within a
predefined privacy budget; however, it requires a substantial amount of data to
achieve performance comparable to models trained on the original data. To
mitigate the significant expense incurred with synthetic data generation,
Dataset Distillation (DD) stands out for its remarkable training and storage
efficiency. This efficiency is particularly advantageous when integrated with
DP mechanisms, curating compact yet informative synthetic datasets without
compromising privacy. However, current state-of-the-art private DD methods
suffer from a synchronized sampling-optimization process and the dependency on
noisy training signals from randomly initialized networks. This results in the
inefficient utilization of private information due to the addition of excessive
noise. To address these issues, we introduce a novel framework that decouples
sampling from optimization for better convergence and improves signal quality
by mitigating the impact of DP noise through matching in an informative
subspace. On CIFAR-10, our method achieves a \textbf{10.0\%} improvement with
50 images per class and \textbf{8.3\%} increase with just \textbf{one-fifth}
the distilled set size of previous state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating
significant potential to advance privacy-preserving DD.

Motivation: 奶牛活动和行为与健康及福利相关，但人工监测耗时且不一致，需要自动化解决方案。

Method: 采用多摄像头系统，结合YOLO11-m模型和SAMURAI算法进行实例分割与跟踪，使用运动感知卡尔曼滤波和数据关联。

Result: 系统在多目标跟踪准确性（MOTA）和身份保持（IDF1）上表现优异，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该系统能实时准确跟踪奶牛，为早期疾病预测和行为分类提供支持。

Abstract: Activity and behaviour correlate with dairy cow health and welfare, making
continual and accurate monitoring crucial for disease identification and farm
productivity. Manual observation and frequent assessments are laborious and
inconsistent for activity monitoring. In this study, we developed a unique
multi-camera, real-time tracking system for indoor-housed Holstein Friesian
dairy cows. This technology uses cutting-edge computer vision techniques,
including instance segmentation and tracking algorithms to monitor cow activity
seamlessly and accurately. An integrated top-down barn panorama was created by
geometrically aligning six camera feeds using homographic transformations. The
detection phase used a refined YOLO11-m model trained on an overhead cow
dataset, obtaining high accuracy (mAP\@0.50 = 0.97, F1 = 0.95). SAMURAI, an
upgraded Segment Anything Model 2.1, generated pixel-precise cow masks for
instance segmentation utilizing zero-shot learning and motion-aware memory.
Even with occlusion and fluctuating posture, a motion-aware Linear Kalman
filter and IoU-based data association reliably identified cows over time for
object tracking. The proposed system significantly outperformed Deep SORT
Realtime. Multi-Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA) was 98.7% and 99.3% in two
benchmark video sequences, with IDF1 scores above 99% and near-zero identity
switches. This unified multi-camera system can track dairy cows in complex
interior surroundings in real time, according to our data. The system reduces
redundant detections across overlapping cameras, maintains continuity as cows
move between viewpoints, with the aim of improving early sickness prediction
through activity quantification and behavioural classification.

language-guided navigation in complex environments. To this end, we propose
Visual Prompt Navigation (VPN), a novel paradigm that guides agents to navigate
using only user-provided visual prompts within 2D top-view maps. This visual
prompt primarily focuses on marking the visual navigation trajectory on a
top-down view of a scene, offering intuitive and spatially grounded guidance
without relying on language instructions. It is more friendly for non-expert
users and reduces interpretive ambiguity. We build VPN tasks in both discrete
and continuous navigation settings, constructing two new datasets, R2R-VP and
R2R-CE-VP, by extending existing R2R and R2R-CE episodes with corresponding
visual prompts. Furthermore, we introduce VPNet, a dedicated baseline network
to handle the VPN tasks, with two data augmentation strategies: view-level
augmentation (altering initial headings and prompt orientations) and
trajectory-level augmentation (incorporating diverse trajectories from
large-scale 3D scenes), to enhance navigation performance. Extensive
experiments evaluate how visual prompt forms, top-view map formats, and data
augmentation strategies affect the performance of visual prompt navigation. The
code is available at https://github.com/farlit/VPN.

*Xiaotong Zhang,Alexander Broersen,Gonnie CM van Erp,Silvia L. Pintea,Jouke Dijkstra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于点的方法用于Couinaud分割，无需显式提供肝脏血管结构先验知识，通过图推理模块学习点邻域间的亲和力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法需要先验的肝脏血管结构知识，耗时且复杂。

Method: 使用3D点表示和添加图推理模块，隐式学习肝脏血管结构。

Result: 在MSD和LiTS数据集上，Dice系数和平均表面距离得分优于四种点基方法。

Conclusion: 该方法无需显式先验知识，性能优越，代码开源。

Abstract: The preoperative planning of liver surgery relies on Couinaud segmentation
from computed tomography (CT) images, to reduce the risk of bleeding and guide
the resection procedure. Using 3D point-based representations, rather than
voxelizing the CT volume, has the benefit of preserving the physical resolution
of the CT. However, point-based representations need prior knowledge of the
liver vessel structure, which is time consuming to acquire. Here, we propose a
point-based method for Couinaud segmentation, without explicitly providing the
prior liver vessel structure. To allow the model to learn this anatomical liver
vessel structure, we add a graph reasoning module on top of the point features.
This adds implicit anatomical information to the model, by learning affinities
across point neighborhoods. Our method is competitive on the MSD and LiTS
public datasets in Dice coefficient and average surface distance scores
compared to four pioneering point-based methods. Our code is available at
https://github.com/ZhangXiaotong015/GrPn.

Conclusion: 验证了跨领域架构适应的有效性，Conformer模型在手语识别中表现优异。

Abstract: The field of Continuous Sign Language Recognition (CSLR) poses substantial
technical challenges, including fluid inter-sign transitions, the absence of
temporal boundaries, and co-articulation effects. This paper, developed for the
MSLR 2025 Workshop Challenge at ICCV 2025, addresses the critical challenge of
signer-independent recognition to advance the generalization capabilities of
CSLR systems across diverse signers. A data-centric methodology is proposed,
centered on systematic feature engineering, a robust preprocessing pipeline,
and an optimized model architecture. Key contributions include a principled
feature selection process guided by Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to isolate
communicative keypoints, a rigorous preprocessing pipeline incorporating
DBSCAN-based outlier filtering and spatial normalization, and the novel
CSLRConformer architecture. This architecture adapts the hybrid CNN-Transformer
design of the Conformer model, leveraging its capacity to model local temporal
dependencies and global sequence context; a characteristic uniquely suited for
the spatio-temporal dynamics of sign language. The proposed methodology
achieved a competitive performance, with a Word Error Rate (WER) of 5.60% on
the development set and 12.01% on the test set, a result that secured a 3rd
place ranking on the official competition platform. This research validates the
efficacy of cross-domain architectural adaptation, demonstrating that the
Conformer model, originally conceived for speech recognition, can be
successfully repurposed to establish a new state-of-the-art performance in
keypoint-based CSLR.

<details>

Motivation: 解决从单目视频中恢复3D手部运动时，尤其是在手与物体交互时，准确性和时间一致性不足的问题。

Method: 通过扩散模型和物理知识增强的运动细化模型，利用运动捕捉数据训练，无需图像标注数据。

Result: 在现有基准测试中实现了最先进的性能，显著提升了多种逐帧重建方法的效果。

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合物理知识和扩散模型，有效提升了3D手部运动恢复的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: While 3D hand reconstruction from monocular images has made significant
progress, generating accurate and temporally coherent motion estimates from
videos remains challenging, particularly during hand-object interactions. In
this paper, we present a novel 3D hand motion recovery framework that enhances
image-based reconstructions through a diffusion-based and physics-augmented
motion refinement model. Our model captures the distribution of refined motion
estimates conditioned on initial ones, generating improved sequences through an
iterative denoising process. Instead of relying on scarce annotated video data,
we train our model only using motion capture data without images. We identify
valuable intuitive physics knowledge during hand-object interactions, including
key motion states and their associated motion constraints. We effectively
integrate these physical insights into our diffusion model to improve its
performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly
improves various frame-wise reconstruction methods, achieving state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance on existing benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniEvent是一个统一的事件表示学习框架，解决了事件相机数据的不均匀性问题，无需任务特定设计，在多个任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件相机数据的不均匀性和非结构化分布导致现有架构难以复用，需要任务特定设计。

Method: 提出解耦-增强-融合范式，独立处理时空特征，利用空间填充曲线提高效率，通过注意力融合特征。

Result: 在3个代表性任务和10个数据集中，OmniEvent比任务特定方法性能提升高达68.2%。

Conclusion: OmniEvent为事件数据提供统一处理框架，显著提升性能并简化模型设计。

Abstract: Event cameras have gained increasing popularity in computer vision due to
their ultra-high dynamic range and temporal resolution. However, event networks
heavily rely on task-specific designs due to the unstructured data distribution
and spatial-temporal (S-T) inhomogeneity, making it hard to reuse existing
architectures for new tasks. We propose OmniEvent, the first unified event
representation learning framework that achieves SOTA performance across diverse
tasks, fully removing the need of task-specific designs. Unlike previous
methods that treat event data as 3D point clouds with manually tuned S-T
scaling weights, OmniEvent proposes a decouple-enhance-fuse paradigm, where the
local feature aggregation and enhancement is done independently on the spatial
and temporal domains to avoid inhomogeneity issues. Space-filling curves are
applied to enable large receptive fields while improving memory and compute
efficiency. The features from individual domains are then fused by attention to
learn S-T interactions. The output of OmniEvent is a grid-shaped tensor, which
enables standard vision models to process event data without architecture
change. With a unified framework and similar hyper-parameters, OmniEvent
out-performs (tasks-specific) SOTA by up to 68.2% across 3 representative tasks
and 10 datasets (Fig.1). Code will be ready in

Abstract: Adversarial attacks against computer vision systems have emerged as a
critical research area that challenges the fundamental assumptions about neural
network robustness and security. This comprehensive survey examines the
evolving landscape of adversarial techniques, revealing their dual nature as
both sophisticated security threats and valuable defensive tools. We provide a
systematic analysis of adversarial attack methodologies across three primary
domains: pixel-space attacks, physically realizable attacks, and latent-space
attacks. Our investigation traces the technical evolution from early
gradient-based methods such as FGSM and PGD to sophisticated optimization
techniques incorporating momentum, adaptive step sizes, and advanced
transferability mechanisms. We examine how physically realizable attacks have
successfully bridged the gap between digital vulnerabilities and real-world
threats through adversarial patches, 3D textures, and dynamic optical
perturbations. Additionally, we explore the emergence of latent-space attacks
that leverage semantic structure in internal representations to create more
transferable and meaningful adversarial examples. Beyond traditional offensive
applications, we investigate the constructive use of adversarial techniques for
vulnerability assessment in biometric authentication systems and protection
against malicious generative models. Our analysis reveals critical research
gaps, particularly in neural style transfer protection and computational
efficiency requirements. This survey contributes a comprehensive taxonomy,
evolution analysis, and identification of future research directions, aiming to
advance understanding of adversarial vulnerabilities and inform the development
of more robust and trustworthy computer vision systems.

### [140] [Context Guided Transformer Entropy Modeling for Video Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01852)
*Junlong Tong,Wei Zhang,Yaohui Jin,Xiaoyu Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Transformer的上下文引导熵模型（CGT），通过重新采样时间上下文和依赖加权的空间上下文，显著降低了计算成本和熵建模时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有条件熵模型在利用时空上下文时存在模型复杂性和计算成本高的问题，且空间上下文模型缺乏对依赖顺序的显式建模。

Method: 设计了时间上下文重采样器和依赖加权的空间上下文分配器（教师-学生网络），分别优化时间和空间上下文建模。

Result: CGT模型将熵建模时间减少约65%，BD-Rate降低11%。

Conclusion: CGT模型通过高效的时间和空间上下文建模，显著提升了熵模型的性能。

Abstract: Conditional entropy models effectively leverage spatio-temporal contexts to
reduce video redundancy. However, incorporating temporal context often
introduces additional model complexity and increases computational cost. In
parallel, many existing spatial context models lack explicit modeling the
ordering of spatial dependencies, which may limit the availability of relevant
context during decoding. To address these issues, we propose the Context Guided
Transformer (CGT) entropy model, which estimates probability mass functions of
the current frame conditioned on resampled temporal context and
dependency-weighted spatial context. A temporal context resampler learns
predefined latent queries to extract critical temporal information using
transformer encoders, reducing downstream computational overhead. Meanwhile, a
teacher-student network is designed as dependency-weighted spatial context
assigner to explicitly model the dependency of spatial context order. The
teacher generates an attention map to represent token importance and an entropy
map to reflect prediction certainty from randomly masked inputs, guiding the
student to select the weighted top-k tokens with the highest spatial
dependency. During inference, only the student is used to predict undecoded
tokens based on high-dependency context. Experimental results demonstrate that
our CGT model reduces entropy modeling time by approximately 65% and achieves
an 11% BD-Rate reduction compared to the previous state-of-the-art conditional
entropy model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究基于明确指令和抽象视觉刺激，忽视了场景上下文，而人类视觉搜索受场景特征驱动，因此需要研究更真实的场景。

Method: 通过36名参与者的用户研究，使用140个真实场景（如桌面图标和工具搜索），结合眼动和脑电图特征进行分类。

Result: 提出的方法在跨用户评估中达到83.6%的准确率，显著优于基于眼跳相关电位的现有方法（56.9%）。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了在真实场景中区分目标与非目标注视点的能力，为理解用户意图和构建辅助系统提供了基础。

Abstract: Distinguishing target from non-target fixations during visual search is a
fundamental building block to understand users' intended actions and to build
effective assistance systems. While prior research indicated the feasibility of
classifying target vs. non-target fixations based on eye tracking and
electroencephalography (EEG) data, these studies were conducted with explicitly
instructed search trajectories, abstract visual stimuli, and disregarded any
scene context. This is in stark contrast with the fact that human visual search
is largely driven by scene characteristics and raises questions regarding
generalizability to more realistic scenarios. To close this gap, we, for the
first time, investigate the classification of target vs. non-target fixations
during free visual search in realistic scenes. In particular, we conducted a
36-participants user study using a large variety of 140 realistic visual search
scenes in two highly relevant application scenarios: searching for icons on
desktop backgrounds and finding tools in a cluttered workshop. Our approach
based on gaze and EEG features outperforms the previous state-of-the-art
approach based on a combination of fixation duration and saccade-related
potentials. We perform extensive evaluations to assess the generalizability of
our approach across scene types. Our approach significantly advances the
ability to distinguish between target and non-target fixations in realistic
scenarios, achieving 83.6% accuracy in cross-user evaluations. This
substantially outperforms previous methods based on saccade-related potentials,
which reached only 56.9% accuracy.

Motivation: 随着深度伪造技术的快速发展，需要更鲁棒和准确的检测算法，同时局部化伪造痕迹对提高模型可解释性和用户信任至关重要。

Conclusion: DiffusionFF在检测准确性和局部化伪造痕迹方面表现出色，具有显著的实际应用价值。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of deepfake generation techniques demands robust and
accurate face forgery detection algorithms. While determining whether an image
has been manipulated remains essential, the ability to precisely localize
forgery artifacts has become increasingly important for improving model
explainability and fostering user trust. To address this challenge, we propose
DiffusionFF, a novel framework that enhances face forgery detection through
diffusion-based artifact localization. Our method utilizes a denoising
diffusion model to generate high-quality Structural Dissimilarity (DSSIM) maps,
which effectively capture subtle traces of manipulation. These DSSIM maps are
then fused with high-level semantic features extracted by a pretrained forgery
detector, leading to significant improvements in detection accuracy. Extensive
experiments on both cross-dataset and intra-dataset benchmarks demonstrate that
DiffusionFF not only achieves superior detection performance but also offers
precise and fine-grained artifact localization, highlighting its overall
effectiveness.

Conclusion: StreamAgent在实时视频流场景中具有实用价值，提升了主动性和效率。

Abstract: Real-time streaming video understanding in domains such as autonomous driving
and intelligent surveillance poses challenges beyond conventional offline video
processing, requiring continuous perception, proactive decision making, and
responsive interaction based on dynamically evolving visual content. However,
existing methods rely on alternating perception-reaction or asynchronous
triggers, lacking task-driven planning and future anticipation, which limits
their real-time responsiveness and proactive decision making in evolving video
streams. To this end, we propose a StreamAgent that anticipates the temporal
intervals and spatial regions expected to contain future task-relevant
information to enable proactive and goal-driven responses. Specifically, we
integrate question semantics and historical observations through prompting the
anticipatory agent to anticipate the temporal progression of key events, align
current observations with the expected future evidence, and subsequently adjust
the perception action (e.g., attending to task-relevant regions or continuously
tracking in subsequent frames). To enable efficient inference, we design a
streaming KV-cache memory mechanism that constructs a hierarchical memory
structure for selective recall of relevant tokens, enabling efficient semantic
retrieval while reducing the overhead of storing all tokens in the traditional
KV-cache. Extensive experiments on streaming and long video understanding tasks
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in response accuracy
and real-time efficiency, highlighting its practical value for real-world
streaming scenarios.

Conclusion: 该框架为医学图像去标识化提供了客观评估方法，促进更安全、一致的数据共享。

Abstract: Medical imaging research increasingly depends on large-scale data sharing to
promote reproducibility and train Artificial Intelligence (AI) models. Ensuring
patient privacy remains a significant challenge for open-access data sharing.
Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM), the global standard
data format for medical imaging, encodes both essential clinical metadata and
extensive protected health information (PHI) and personally identifiable
information (PII). Effective de-identification must remove identifiers,
preserve scientific utility, and maintain DICOM validity. Tools exist to
perform de-identification, but few assess its effectiveness, and most rely on
subjective reviews, limiting reproducibility and regulatory confidence. To
address this gap, we developed an openly accessible DICOM dataset infused with
synthetic PHI/PII and an evaluation framework for benchmarking image
de-identification workflows. The Medical Image de-identification (MIDI) dataset
was built using publicly available de-identified data from The Cancer Imaging
Archive (TCIA). It includes 538 subjects (216 for validation, 322 for testing),
605 studies, 708 series, and 53,581 DICOM image instances. These span multiple
vendors, imaging modalities, and cancer types. Synthetic PHI and PII were
embedded into structured data elements, plain text data elements, and pixel
data to simulate real-world identity leaks encountered by TCIA curation teams.
Accompanying evaluation tools include a Python script, answer keys (known
truth), and mapping files that enable automated comparison of curated data
against expected transformations. The framework is aligned with the HIPAA
Privacy Rule "Safe Harbor" method, DICOM PS3.15 Confidentiality Profiles, and
TCIA best practices. It supports objective, standards-driven evaluation of
de-identification workflows, promoting safer and more consistent medical image
sharing.

Result: 平均减少54%的帧数，显著节省能源，同时在记忆任务中表现相当。

Conclusion: EgoTrigger为全天候智能眼镜提供了一种高效节能的上下文感知触发策略。

Abstract: All-day smart glasses are likely to emerge as platforms capable of continuous
contextual sensing, uniquely positioning them for unprecedented assistance in
our daily lives. Integrating the multi-modal AI agents required for human
memory enhancement while performing continuous sensing, however, presents a
major energy efficiency challenge for all-day usage. Achieving this balance
requires intelligent, context-aware sensor management. Our approach,
EgoTrigger, leverages audio cues from the microphone to selectively activate
power-intensive cameras, enabling efficient sensing while preserving
substantial utility for human memory enhancement. EgoTrigger uses a lightweight
audio model (YAMNet) and a custom classification head to trigger image capture
from hand-object interaction (HOI) audio cues, such as the sound of a drawer
opening or a medication bottle being opened. In addition to evaluating on the
QA-Ego4D dataset, we introduce and evaluate on the Human Memory Enhancement
Question-Answer (HME-QA) dataset. Our dataset contains 340 human-annotated
first-person QA pairs from full-length Ego4D videos that were curated to ensure
that they contained audio, focusing on HOI moments critical for contextual
understanding and memory. Our results show EgoTrigger can use 54% fewer frames
on average, significantly saving energy in both power-hungry sensing components
(e.g., cameras) and downstream operations (e.g., wireless transmission), while
achieving comparable performance on datasets for an episodic memory task. We
believe this context-aware triggering strategy represents a promising direction
for enabling energy-efficient, functional smart glasses capable of all-day use
-- supporting applications like helping users recall where they placed their
keys or information about their routine activities (e.g., taking medications).

Motivation: 工业检测中管理多个任务特定模型复杂且低效，统一视觉语言模型（VLMs）有望简化流程。

Result: InspectVLM在图像分类和关键点任务上表现尚可，但在核心检测指标上不如ResNet模型，且存在鲁棒性和语言响应问题。

Conclusion: 当前VLMs在视觉基础和鲁棒性上不足，不适合高精度工业检测部署。

Abstract: Unified vision-language models (VLMs) promise to streamline computer vision
pipelines by reframing multiple visual tasks such as classification, detection,
and keypoint localization within a single language-driven interface. This
architecture is particularly appealing in industrial inspection, where managing
disjoint task-specific models introduces complexity, inefficiency, and
maintenance overhead. In this paper, we critically evaluate the viability of
this unified paradigm using InspectVLM, a Florence-2-based VLM trained on
InspectMM, our new large-scale multimodal, multitask inspection dataset. While
InspectVLM performs competitively on image-level classification and structured
keypoint tasks, we find that it fails to match traditional ResNet-based models
in core inspection metrics. Notably, the model exhibits brittle behavior under
low prompt variability, produces degenerate outputs for fine-grained object
detection, and frequently defaults to memorized language responses regardless
of visual input. Our findings suggest that while language-driven unification
offers conceptual elegance, current VLMs lack the visual grounding and
robustness necessary for deployment in precision critical industrial
inspections.

Abstract: Instance segmentation is critical in biomedical imaging to accurately
distinguish individual objects like cells, which often overlap and vary in
size. Recent query-based methods, where object queries guide segmentation, have
shown strong performance. While U-Net has been a go-to architecture in medical
image segmentation, its potential in query-based approaches remains largely
unexplored. In this work, we present IAUNet, a novel query-based U-Net
architecture. The core design features a full U-Net architecture, enhanced by a
novel lightweight convolutional Pixel decoder, making the model more efficient
and reducing the number of parameters. Additionally, we propose a Transformer
decoder that refines object-specific features across multiple scales. Finally,
we introduce the 2025 Revvity Full Cell Segmentation Dataset, a unique resource
with detailed annotations of overlapping cell cytoplasm in brightfield images,
setting a new benchmark for biomedical instance segmentation. Experiments on
multiple public datasets and our own show that IAUNet outperforms most
state-of-the-art fully convolutional, transformer-based, and query-based models
and cell segmentation-specific models, setting a strong baseline for cell
instance segmentation tasks. Code is available at

TL;DR: DBOM框架通过解耦触发器和对象表示，利用视觉语言模型检测和中和数据集中的后门威胁，包括未见过的配置。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络和生成AI易受后门攻击，传统方法难以检测多触发器和未见配置的威胁。

Method: DBOM利用视觉语言模型解耦触发器和对象表示，通过视觉提示库和损失函数分离特征，实现零样本泛化。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和GTSRB上，DBOM能有效检测中毒图像，提升训练管道的安全性。

Conclusion: DBOM为后门攻击检测提供了新思路，能应对未见过的触发器和对象配置。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) and generative AI (GenAI) are increasingly
vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where adversaries embed triggers into inputs to
cause models to misclassify or misinterpret target labels. Beyond traditional
single-trigger scenarios, attackers may inject multiple triggers across various
object classes, forming unseen backdoor-object configurations that evade
standard detection pipelines. In this paper, we introduce DBOM (Disentangled
Backdoor-Object Modeling), a proactive framework that leverages structured
disentanglement to identify and neutralize both seen and unseen backdoor
threats at the dataset level. Specifically, DBOM factorizes input image
representations by modeling triggers and objects as independent primitives in
the embedding space through the use of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). By
leveraging the frozen, pre-trained encoders of VLMs, our approach decomposes
the latent representations into distinct components through a learnable visual
prompt repository and prompt prefix tuning, ensuring that the relationships
between triggers and objects are explicitly captured. To separate trigger and
object representations in the visual prompt repository, we introduce the
trigger-object separation and diversity losses that aids in disentangling
trigger and object visual features. Next, by aligning image features with
feature decomposition and fusion, as well as learned contextual prompt tokens
in a shared multimodal space, DBOM enables zero-shot generalization to novel
trigger-object pairings that were unseen during training, thereby offering
deeper insights into adversarial attack patterns. Experimental results on
CIFAR-10 and GTSRB demonstrate that DBOM robustly detects poisoned images prior
to downstream training, significantly enhancing the security of DNN training
pipelines.

TL;DR: 论文研究了对比自监督学习（SSL）在YOLO系列目标检测器上的应用，通过SimCLR框架在未标注数据上预训练，减少对大规模标注数据的依赖，并在低标注数据场景下取得更好性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减少YOLO系列目标检测器对大规模标注数据的依赖，利用未标注数据提升模型性能。

Method: 使用SimCLR框架预训练YOLOv5和YOLOv8的卷积主干网络，通过全局池化和投影头优化对比损失，并在未标注的COCO数据集上进行训练。

Result: SSL预训练显著提升了mAP、收敛速度和精度-召回性能，尤其是在低标注数据场景下。例如，SimCLR预训练的YOLOv8在mAP@50:95上达到0.7663，优于监督学习版本。

Conclusion: 对比自监督学习为单阶段目标检测器提供了有效的预训练方法，展示了未标注数据在标签高效目标检测中的潜力。

Abstract: One-stage object detectors such as the YOLO family achieve state-of-the-art
performance in real-time vision applications but remain heavily reliant on
large-scale labeled datasets for training. In this work, we present a
systematic study of contrastive self-supervised learning (SSL) as a means to
reduce this dependency by pretraining YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 backbones on unlabeled
images using the SimCLR framework. Our approach introduces a simple yet
effective pipeline that adapts YOLO's convolutional backbones as encoders,
employs global pooling and projection heads, and optimizes a contrastive loss
using augmentations of the COCO unlabeled dataset (120k images). The pretrained
backbones are then fine-tuned on a cyclist detection task with limited labeled
data. Experimental results show that SSL pretraining leads to consistently
higher mAP, faster convergence, and improved precision-recall performance,
especially in low-label regimes. For example, our SimCLR-pretrained YOLOv8
achieves a mAP@50:95 of 0.7663, outperforming its supervised counterpart
despite using no annotations during pretraining. These findings establish a
strong baseline for applying contrastive SSL to one-stage detectors and
highlight the potential of unlabeled data as a scalable resource for
label-efficient object detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶车辆生成的点云数据量大，存储、带宽和处理成本高，需高效降采样方法。

Method: 分两步：1) 无监督密度峰值分类器与监督朴素贝叶斯分类器检测物体；2) 采样预算分配策略保留物体信息。

Result: 在KITTI和nuScenes数据集上表现优于现有方法，效率和效果均优。

Conclusion: 该方法通用性强，可无缝集成到多种下游模型中，是自动驾驶点云降采样的高效工具。

Abstract: Point clouds are essential for object modeling and play a critical role in
assisting driving tasks for autonomous vehicles (AVs). However, the significant
volume of data generated by AVs creates challenges for storage, bandwidth, and
processing cost. To tackle these challenges, we propose a representative point
selection framework for point cloud downsampling, which preserves critical
object-related information while effectively filtering out irrelevant
background points. Our method involves two steps: (1) Object Presence
Detection, where we introduce an unsupervised density peak-based classifier and
a supervised Na\"ive Bayes classifier to handle diverse scenarios, and (2)
Sampling Budget Allocation, where we propose a strategy that selects
object-relevant points while maintaining a high retention rate of object
information. Extensive experiments on the KITTI and nuScenes datasets
demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines
in both efficiency and effectiveness across varying sampling rates. As a
model-agnostic solution, our approach integrates seamlessly with diverse
downstream models, making it a valuable and scalable addition to the 3D point
cloud downsampling toolkit for AV applications.

Result: 在Babel-QA和HuMMan数据集上达到最优性能，展示了跨数据集的适应性。

Conclusion: IMoRe框架通过隐式程序引导和动态表示选择，显著提升了运动推理的精确性和适应性。

Abstract: Existing human motion Q\&A methods rely on explicit program execution, where
the requirement for manually defined functional modules may limit the
scalability and adaptability. To overcome this, we propose an implicit
program-guided motion reasoning (IMoRe) framework that unifies reasoning across
multiple query types without manually designed modules. Unlike existing
implicit reasoning approaches that infer reasoning operations from question
words, our model directly conditions on structured program functions, ensuring
a more precise execution of reasoning steps. Additionally, we introduce a
program-guided reading mechanism, which dynamically selects multi-level motion
representations from a pretrained motion Vision Transformer (ViT), capturing
both high-level semantics and fine-grained motion cues. The reasoning module
iteratively refines memory representations, leveraging structured program
functions to extract relevant information for different query types. Our model
achieves state-of-the-art performance on Babel-QA and generalizes to a newly
constructed motion Q\&A dataset based on HuMMan, demonstrating its adaptability
across different motion reasoning datasets. Code and dataset are available at:

Abstract: As the application of deep learning in dermatology continues to grow, the
recognition of melanoma has garnered significant attention, demonstrating
potential for improving diagnostic accuracy. Despite advancements in image
classification techniques, existing models still face challenges in identifying
subtle visual cues that differentiate melanoma from benign lesions. This paper
presents a novel Deeply Dual Supervised Learning framework that integrates
local and global feature extraction to enhance melanoma recognition. By
employing a dual-pathway structure, the model focuses on both fine-grained
local features and broader contextual information, ensuring a comprehensive
understanding of the image content. The framework utilizes a dual attention
mechanism that dynamically emphasizes critical features, thereby reducing the
risk of overlooking subtle characteristics of melanoma. Additionally, we
introduce a multi-scale feature aggregation strategy to ensure robust
performance across varying image resolutions. Extensive experiments on
benchmark datasets demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in melanoma detection, achieving higher accuracy and
better resilience against false positives. This work lays the foundation for
future research in automated skin cancer recognition and highlights the
effectiveness of dual supervised learning in medical image analysis.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于二维函数和Quasi-Fresnel变换的NLOS成像方法，显著降低计算复杂度和内存需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NLOS成像方法因忽略隐藏物体的二维特性，导致高计算成本和内存消耗，限制了实际应用。

Method: 使用二维函数表示隐藏场景，并利用Quasi-Fresnel变换建立测量数据与隐藏场景的直接反演公式。

Result: 算法显著减少运行时间和内存需求，同时保持成像质量，适用于轻量设备。

Conclusion: 该方法有望实现实时高分辨率NLOS成像，并扩展其应用平台范围。

Abstract: Non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging seeks to reconstruct hidden objects by
analyzing reflections from intermediary surfaces. Existing methods typically
model both the measurement data and the hidden scene in three dimensions,
overlooking the inherently two-dimensional nature of most hidden objects. This
oversight leads to high computational costs and substantial memory consumption,
limiting practical applications and making real-time, high-resolution NLOS
imaging on lightweight devices challenging. In this paper, we introduce a novel
approach that represents the hidden scene using two-dimensional functions and
employs a Quasi-Fresnel transform to establish a direct inversion formula
between the measurement data and the hidden scene. This transformation
leverages the two-dimensional characteristics of the problem to significantly
reduce computational complexity and memory requirements. Our algorithm
efficiently performs fast transformations between these two-dimensional
aggregated data, enabling rapid reconstruction of hidden objects with minimal
memory usage. Compared to existing methods, our approach reduces runtime and
memory demands by several orders of magnitude while maintaining imaging
quality. The substantial reduction in memory usage not only enhances
computational efficiency but also enables NLOS imaging on lightweight devices
such as mobile and embedded systems. We anticipate that this method will
facilitate real-time, high-resolution NLOS imaging and broaden its
applicability across a wider range of platforms.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在三个图像生成任务中优于现有图像提示模型，能更准确地反映图像提示的细节。

Conclusion: 通过冲突自由引导和分层注意力，本文方法显著提升了图像生成中对图像提示的忠实度。

Abstract: While large-scale text-to-image diffusion models enable the generation of
high-quality, diverse images from text prompts, these prompts struggle to
capture intricate details, such as textures, preventing the user intent from
being reflected. This limitation has led to efforts to generate images
conditioned on user-provided images, referred to as image prompts. Recent work
modifies the self-attention mechanism to impose image conditions in generated
images by replacing or concatenating the keys and values from the image prompt.
This enables the self-attention layer to work like a cross-attention layer,
generally used to incorporate text prompts. In this paper, we identify two
common issues in existing methods of modifying self-attention to generate
images that reflect the details of image prompts. First, existing approaches
neglect the importance of image prompts in classifier-free guidance.
Specifically, current methods use image prompts as both desired and undesired
conditions in classifier-free guidance, causing conflicting signals. To resolve
this, we propose conflict-free guidance by using image prompts only as desired
conditions, ensuring that the generated image faithfully reflects the image
prompt. In addition, we observe that the two most common self-attention
modifications involve a trade-off between the realism of the generated image
and alignment with the image prompt. Specifically, selecting more keys and
values from the image prompt improves alignment, while selecting more from the
generated image enhances realism. To balance both, we propose an new
self-attention modification method, Stratified Attention to jointly use keys
and values from both images rather than selecting between them. Through
extensive experiments across three image generation tasks, we show that the
proposed method outperforms existing image-prompting models in faithfully
reflecting the image prompt.

TL;DR: 提出了Bench2ADVLM框架，用于在闭环设置中评估自动驾驶视觉语言模型（ADVLMs），填补了现有评估方法的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前ADVLMs的评估主要基于静态输入的开环设置，缺乏对交互行为和实际安全性的闭环评估。

Method: 通过双系统适应架构将ADVLMs适配到仿真环境，设计物理控制抽象层实现仿真与现实的闭环测试，并引入自反场景生成模块。

Result: 实验验证了框架的诊断能力，显示现有ADVLMs在闭环条件下性能有限。

Conclusion: Bench2ADVLM为ADVLMs提供了全面的闭环评估方法，揭示了其在实际应用中的局限性。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have recently emerged as a promising paradigm
in autonomous driving (AD). However, current performance evaluation protocols
for VLM-based AD systems (ADVLMs) are predominantly confined to open-loop
settings with static inputs, neglecting the more realistic and informative
closed-loop setting that captures interactive behavior, feedback resilience,
and real-world safety. To address this, we introduce Bench2ADVLM, a unified
hierarchical closed-loop evaluation framework for real-time, interactive
assessment of ADVLMs across both simulation and physical platforms. Inspired by
dual-process theories of cognition, we first adapt diverse ADVLMs to simulation
environments via a dual-system adaptation architecture. In this design,
heterogeneous high-level driving commands generated by target ADVLMs (fast
system) are interpreted by a general-purpose VLM (slow system) into
standardized mid-level control actions suitable for execution in simulation. To
bridge the gap between simulation and reality, we design a physical control
abstraction layer that translates these mid-level actions into low-level
actuation signals, enabling, for the first time, closed-loop testing of ADVLMs
on physical vehicles. To enable more comprehensive evaluation, Bench2ADVLM
introduces a self-reflective scenario generation module that automatically
explores model behavior and uncovers potential failure modes for
safety-critical scenario generation. Overall, Bench2ADVLM establishes a
hierarchical evaluation pipeline that seamlessly integrates high-level abstract
reasoning, mid-level simulation actions, and low-level real-world execution.
Experiments on diverse scenarios across multiple state-of-the-art ADVLMs and
physical platforms validate the diagnostic strength of our framework, revealing
that existing ADVLMs still exhibit limited performance under closed-loop
conditions.

TL;DR: Protego是一种保护面部图像隐私的方法，通过动态3D掩码防止基于检索的面部识别系统滥用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有面部识别技术（如Clearview AI和PimEyes）滥用导致隐私泄露，Protego旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 将用户3D面部特征封装为姿态不变的2D表示，并动态变形为自然3D掩码，应用于在线分享前的图像。

Result: 实验显示Protego显著降低检索准确率，性能优于现有方法至少2倍，且视觉连贯性优异。

Conclusion: Protego有效对抗面部识别技术的滥用，保护用户隐私。

Abstract: Face recognition (FR) technologies are increasingly used to power large-scale
image retrieval systems, raising serious privacy concerns. Services like
Clearview AI and PimEyes allow anyone to upload a facial photo and retrieve a
large amount of online content associated with that person. This not only
enables identity inference but also exposes their digital footprint, such as
social media activity, private photos, and news reports, often without their
consent. In response to this emerging threat, we propose Protego, a
user-centric privacy protection method that safeguards facial images from such
retrieval-based privacy intrusions. Protego encapsulates a user's 3D facial
signatures into a pose-invariant 2D representation, which is dynamically
deformed into a natural-looking 3D mask tailored to the pose and expression of
any facial image of the user, and applied prior to online sharing. Motivated by
a critical limitation of existing methods, Protego amplifies the sensitivity of
FR models so that protected images cannot be matched even among themselves.
Experiments show that Protego significantly reduces retrieval accuracy across a
wide range of black-box FR models and performs at least 2x better than existing
methods. It also offers unprecedented visual coherence, particularly in video
settings where consistency and natural appearance are essential. Overall,
Protego contributes to the fight against the misuse of FR for mass surveillance
and unsolicited identity tracing.

Motivation: 解决传统放疗计划依赖专家经验且现有深度学习方法泛化性和准确性不足的问题。

Method: 采用LightweightVAE3D压缩CT数据，结合多模态输入和条件扩散模型，通过复合损失函数优化预测结果。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优异，MAE为0.101-0.154，DICE系数0.927，计划生成时间降至22秒。

Conclusion: ADDiff-Dose为放疗剂量预测提供了通用高效的解决方案，有望显著提升临床工作效率。

Abstract: Radiotherapy treatment planning often relies on time-consuming,
trial-and-error adjustments that heavily depend on the expertise of
specialists, while existing deep learning methods face limitations in
generalization, prediction accuracy, and clinical applicability. To tackle
these challenges, we propose ADDiff-Dose, an Anatomical-Dose Dual Constraints
Conditional Diffusion Model for end-to-end multi-tumor dose prediction. The
model employs LightweightVAE3D to compress high-dimensional CT data and
integrates multimodal inputs, including target and organ-at-risk (OAR) masks
and beam parameters, within a progressive noise addition and denoising
framework. It incorporates conditional features via a multi-head attention
mechanism and utilizes a composite loss function combining MSE, conditional
terms, and KL divergence to ensure both dosimetric accuracy and compliance with
clinical constraints. Evaluation on a large-scale public dataset (2,877 cases)
and three external institutional cohorts (450 cases in total) demonstrates that
ADDiff-Dose significantly outperforms traditional baselines, achieving an MAE
of 0.101-0.154 (compared to 0.316 for UNet and 0.169 for GAN models), a DICE
coefficient of 0.927 (a 6.8% improvement), and limiting spinal cord maximum
dose error to within 0.1 Gy. The average plan generation time per case is
reduced to 22 seconds. Ablation studies confirm that the structural encoder
enhances compliance with clinical dose constraints by 28.5%. To our knowledge,
this is the first study to introduce a conditional diffusion model framework
for radiotherapy dose prediction, offering a generalizable and efficient
solution for automated treatment planning across diverse tumor sites, with the
potential to substantially reduce planning time and improve clinical workflow
efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集（如Mapillary）的标注粒度较粗，无法区分语义重要的交通标志类型（如停车标志和限速标志），因此需要更精细的标注数据集。

Method: 通过分解复合交通标志为细粒度类别，创建了MVV数据集，并手动标注像素级实例掩码。同时，对比了多种VLM和DINOv2模型在数据集上的表现。

Result: DINOv2在交通标志识别及其他类别（如车辆和行人）上均优于其他VLM基线，揭示了当前视觉语言模型在细粒度视觉理解上的局限性。

Conclusion: MVV数据集和DINOv2模型为自动驾驶场景中的密集语义匹配提供了可靠基准，推动了更可解释和可扩展的感知系统发展。

Abstract: Obtaining high-quality fine-grained annotations for traffic signs is critical
for accurate and safe decision-making in autonomous driving. Widely used
datasets, such as Mapillary, often provide only coarse-grained labels - without
distinguishing semantically important types such as stop signs or speed limit
signs. To this end, we present a new validation set for traffic signs derived
from the Mapillary dataset called Mapillary Vistas Validation for Traffic Signs
(MVV), where we decompose composite traffic signs into granular, semantically
meaningful categories. The dataset includes pixel-level instance masks and has
been manually annotated by expert annotators to ensure label fidelity. Further,
we benchmark several state-of-the-art VLMs against the self-supervised DINOv2
model on this dataset and show that DINOv2 consistently outperforms all VLM
baselines-not only on traffic sign recognition, but also on heavily represented
categories like vehicles and humans. Our analysis reveals significant
limitations in current vision-language models for fine-grained visual
understanding and establishes DINOv2 as a strong baseline for dense semantic
matching in autonomous driving scenarios. This dataset and evaluation framework
pave the way for more reliable, interpretable, and scalable perception systems.

Motivation: 解决分布式多阶段图像压缩中计算资源利用不足、重复压缩导致的效率低下和质量损失问题。

Method: 采用分层级联框架（HCF），通过潜在空间转换和策略驱动的量化控制优化率失真权衡。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优异，PSNR增益最高达0.6dB，计算资源节省显著（如97.8% FLOPs）。

Conclusion: HCF在性能与效率上均优于现有方法，支持无重训练的多质量适应。

Abstract: Distributed multi-stage image compression -- where visual content traverses
multiple processing nodes under varying quality requirements -- poses
challenges. Progressive methods enable bitstream truncation but underutilize
available compute resources; successive compression repeats costly pixel-domain
operations and suffers cumulative quality loss and inefficiency;
fixed-parameter models lack post-encoding flexibility. In this work, we
developed the Hierarchical Cascade Framework (HCF) that achieves high
rate-distortion performance and better computational efficiency through direct
latent-space transformations across network nodes in distributed multi-stage
image compression system. Under HCF, we introduced policy-driven quantization
control to optimize rate-distortion trade-offs, and established the edge
quantization principle through differential entropy analysis. The configuration
based on this principle demonstrates up to 0.6dB PSNR gains over other
configurations. When comprehensively evaluated on the Kodak, CLIC, and
CLIC2020-mobile datasets, HCF outperforms successive-compression methods by up
to 5.56% BD-Rate in PSNR on CLIC, while saving up to 97.8% FLOPs, 96.5% GPU
memory, and 90.0% execution time. It also outperforms state-of-the-art
progressive compression methods by up to 12.64% BD-Rate on Kodak and enables
retraining-free cross-quality adaptation with 7.13-10.87% BD-Rate reductions on
CLIC2020-mobile.

Conclusion: StarPose通过自回归扩散框架和时空引导机制，显著提升了3D姿态估计的性能，为相关领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Monocular 3D human pose estimation remains a challenging task due to inherent
depth ambiguities and occlusions. Compared to traditional methods based on
Transformers or Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), recent diffusion-based
approaches have shown superior performance, leveraging their probabilistic
nature and high-fidelity generation capabilities. However, these methods often
fail to account for the spatial and temporal correlations across predicted
frames, resulting in limited temporal consistency and inferior accuracy in
predicted 3D pose sequences. To address these shortcomings, this paper proposes
StarPose, an autoregressive diffusion framework that effectively incorporates
historical 3D pose predictions and spatial-temporal physical guidance to
significantly enhance both the accuracy and temporal coherence of pose
predictions. Unlike existing approaches, StarPose models the 2D-to-3D pose
mapping as an autoregressive diffusion process. By synergically integrating
previously predicted 3D poses with 2D pose inputs via a Historical Pose
Integration Module (HPIM), the framework generates rich and informative
historical pose embeddings that guide subsequent denoising steps, ensuring
temporally consistent predictions. In addition, a fully plug-and-play
Spatial-Temporal Physical Guidance (STPG) mechanism is tailored to refine the
denoising process in an iterative manner, which further enforces spatial
anatomical plausibility and temporal motion dynamics, rendering robust and
realistic pose estimates. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets
demonstrate that StarPose outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving
superior accuracy and temporal consistency in 3D human pose estimation. Code is

YOLO (You Only Look Once) family of models transforming the landscape of
real-time vision applications through unified, end-to-end detection frameworks.
From YOLOv1's pioneering regression-based detection to the latest YOLOv9, each
version has systematically enhanced the balance between speed, accuracy, and
deployment efficiency through continuous architectural and algorithmic
advancements.. Beyond core object detection, modern YOLO architectures have
expanded to support tasks such as instance segmentation, pose estimation,
object tracking, and domain-specific applications including medical imaging and
industrial automation. This paper offers a comprehensive review of the YOLO
family, highlighting architectural innovations, performance benchmarks,
extended capabilities, and real-world use cases. We critically analyze the
evolution of YOLO models and discuss emerging research directions that extend
their impact across diverse computer vision domains.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结构化放射学报告生成（S-RRG）的新方法，包括数据集构建、模型训练和新的评估框架，旨在解决传统报告冗余和不一致的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自由文本放射学报告存在冗余和语言不一致问题，结构化报告（S-RRG）能提供标准化格式，但现有方法依赖预定义标签或模板，限制了表达性和临床细节的完整性。

Method: 构建了MIMIC-STRUC数据集，包含疾病名称、严重程度、概率和解剖位置；训练了一个基于LLM的模型生成标准化报告；提出了S-Score评估指标，专注于临床决策关键元素。

Result: 提出的方法生成了高质量的标准化报告，S-Score评估指标与人类评估更一致，提供了更临床相关的报告质量衡量标准。

Conclusion: 结构化报告和定制化评估指标对S-RRG至关重要，新方法在临床相关性和报告质量上表现更优。

Abstract: Radiology report generation (RRG) for diagnostic images, such as chest
X-rays, plays a pivotal role in both clinical practice and AI. Traditional
free-text reports suffer from redundancy and inconsistent language,
complicating the extraction of critical clinical details. Structured radiology
report generation (S-RRG) offers a promising solution by organizing information
into standardized, concise formats. However, existing approaches often rely on
classification or visual question answering (VQA) pipelines that require
predefined label sets and produce only fragmented outputs. Template-based
approaches, which generate reports by replacing keywords within fixed sentence
patterns, further compromise expressiveness and often omit clinically important
details. In this work, we present a novel approach to S-RRG that includes
dataset construction, model training, and the introduction of a new evaluation
framework. We first create a robust chest X-ray dataset (MIMIC-STRUC) that
includes disease names, severity levels, probabilities, and anatomical
locations, ensuring that the dataset is both clinically relevant and
well-structured. We train an LLM-based model to generate standardized,
high-quality reports. To assess the generated reports, we propose a specialized
evaluation metric (S-Score) that not only measures disease prediction accuracy
but also evaluates the precision of disease-specific details, thus offering a
clinically meaningful metric for report quality that focuses on elements
critical to clinical decision-making and demonstrates a stronger alignment with
human assessments. Our approach highlights the effectiveness of structured
reports and the importance of a tailored evaluation metric for S-RRG, providing
a more clinically relevant measure of report quality.

TL;DR: VLM4D是一个专门评估视觉语言模型（VLMs）时空推理能力的基准测试，揭示了现有模型在动态时空理解上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前VLMs在动态时空交互理解上存在显著缺陷，无法像人类一样轻松跟踪和推理物体运动、旋转和视角变化。

Method: 通过构建包含真实和合成视频的VLM4D基准测试，评估VLMs在平移、旋转、视角感知和运动连续性等方面的表现。

Result: 评估显示，现有VLMs在整合多视觉线索和保持时间一致性方面表现不佳，与人类基线存在显著差距。

Conclusion: 研究表明，4D特征场重建和针对性时空监督微调是提升VLMs时空理解能力的有效方向，为动态环境下的视觉智能发展铺路。

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in
integrating linguistic and visual reasoning but remain fundamentally limited in
understanding dynamic spatiotemporal interactions. Humans effortlessly track
and reason about object movements, rotations, and perspective shifts-abilities
essential for robust dynamic real-world understanding yet notably lacking in
current VLMs. In this paper, we introduce VLM4D, the first benchmark
specifically designed to evaluate the spatiotemporal reasoning capabilities of
VLMs. Our benchmark comprises diverse real-world and synthetic videos
accompanied by carefully curated question-answer pairs emphasizing
translational and rotational motions, perspective awareness, and motion
continuity. Through comprehensive evaluations of state-of-the-art open and
closed-source VLMs, we identify significant performance gaps compared to human
baselines, highlighting fundamental deficiencies in existing models. Extensive
analysis reveals that VLMs struggle particularly with integrating multiple
visual cues and maintaining temporal coherence. We further explore promising
directions, such as leveraging 4D feature field reconstruction and targeted
spatiotemporal supervised fine-tuning, demonstrating their effectiveness in
enhancing spatiotemporal comprehension. Our work aims to encourage deeper
exploration into improving VLMs' spatial and temporal grounding, paving the way
towards more capable and reliable visual intelligence for dynamic environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新框架，通过语义驱动的LoRA检索和动态聚合解决分布式LoRA模块的三大挑战，显著提升图像生成性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管FLUX和Stable Diffusion v3等大规模模型在逼真图像生成方面取得进展，但其实际部署受限于参数微调的困难。现有LoRA模块面临稀疏元数据标注、零样本适应需求和多LoRA融合策略不足等问题。

Method: 框架包含两部分：(1)基于权重编码的LoRA检索器，建立LoRA参数矩阵与文本提示的共享语义空间；(2)细粒度门控融合机制，动态计算多LoRA模块的融合权重。

Result: 显著提升图像生成性能，支持基础模型的高效增强。

Conclusion: 该工作填补了社区开发的LoRA与实际部署需求之间的鸿沟，通过标准化适配器集成推动协作模型演进。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in photorealistic image generation through
large-scale models like FLUX and Stable Diffusion v3, the practical deployment
of these architectures remains constrained by their inherent intractability to
parameter fine-tuning. While low-rank adaptation (LoRA) have demonstrated
efficacy in enabling model customization with minimal parameter overhead, the
effective utilization of distributed open-source LoRA modules faces three
critical challenges: sparse metadata annotation, the requirement for zero-shot
adaptation capabilities, and suboptimal fusion strategies for multi-LoRA fusion
strategies. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel framework that
enables semantic-driven LoRA retrieval and dynamic aggregation through two key
components: (1) weight encoding-base LoRA retriever that establishes a shared
semantic space between LoRA parameter matrices and text prompts, eliminating
dependence on original training data, and (2) fine-grained gated fusion
mechanism that computes context-specific fusion weights across network layers
and diffusion timesteps to optimally integrate multiple LoRA modules during
generation. Our approach achieves significant improvement in image generation
perfermance, thereby facilitating scalable and data-efficient enhancement of
foundational models. This work establishes a critical bridge between the
fragmented landscape of community-developed LoRAs and practical deployment
requirements, enabling collaborative model evolution through standardized
adapter integration.

TL;DR: DeflareMamba利用状态空间模型高效序列建模能力，通过分层框架和局部增强模型解决镜头光晕去除问题，保持背景一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在去除光晕时难以保持上下文一致性，导致不完整和不一致的去除效果。

Method: 提出DeflareMamba，结合状态空间模型的分层框架，通过变步长采样建立长程像素关联，同时保留局部细节。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能有效去除多种光晕，保持非光晕区域自然外观，并提升下游任务性能。

Conclusion: DeflareMamba首次将状态空间模型引入光晕去除任务，效果显著且具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Lens flare removal remains an information confusion challenge in the
underlying image background and the optical flares, due to the complex optical
interactions between light sources and camera lens. While recent solutions have
shown promise in decoupling the flare corruption from image, they often fail to
maintain contextual consistency, leading to incomplete and inconsistent flare
removal. To eliminate this limitation, we propose DeflareMamba, which leverages
the efficient sequence modeling capabilities of state space models while
maintains the ability to capture local-global dependencies. Particularly, we
design a hierarchical framework that establishes long-range pixel correlations
through varied stride sampling patterns, and utilize local-enhanced state space
models that simultaneously preserves local details. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first work that introduces state space models to the
flare removal task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
effectively removes various types of flare artifacts, including scattering and
reflective flares, while maintaining the natural appearance of non-flare
regions. Further downstream applications demonstrate the capacity of our method
to improve visual object recognition and cross-modal semantic understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NRE-Net提出了一种多模态检测框架，结合RGB图像、事件流和单目预测的法线图，通过自适应融合模块提升恶劣光照条件下的物体检测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 恶劣光照条件下（如自动驾驶场景）的物体检测常因反射干扰导致误检，现有RGB或事件数据单独使用效果不佳，需探索多模态融合方法。

Method: 提出NRE-Net框架，融合RGB图像、事件流和单目预测的法线图，采用ADFM和EAFM模块优化多模态特征融合。

Result: 在DSEC-Det-sub和PKU-DAVIS-SOD数据集上，NRE-Net显著优于现有方法，mAP50分别提升7.9%/6.1%和2.7%/7.1%。

Conclusion: NRE-Net通过多模态融合有效抑制误检，提升检测精度，为恶劣光照条件下的物体检测提供了新思路。

Abstract: Accurate object detection under adverse lighting conditions is critical for
real-world applications such as autonomous driving. Although neuromorphic event
cameras have been introduced to handle these scenarios, adverse lighting often
induces distracting reflections from tunnel walls or road surfaces, which
frequently lead to false obstacle detections. However, neither RGB nor event
data alone is robust enough to address these complexities, and mitigating these
issues without additional sensors remains underexplored. To overcome these
challenges, we propose leveraging normal maps, directly predicted from
monocular RGB images, as robust geometric cues to suppress false positives and
enhance detection accuracy. We introduce NRE-Net, a novel multi-modal detection
framework that effectively fuses three complementary modalities: monocularly
predicted surface normal maps, RGB images, and event streams. To optimize the
fusion process, our framework incorporates two key modules: the Adaptive
Dual-stream Fusion Module (ADFM), which integrates RGB and normal map features,
and the Event-modality Aware Fusion Module (EAFM), which adapts to the high
dynamic range characteristics of event data. Extensive evaluations on the
DSEC-Det-sub and PKU-DAVIS-SOD datasets demonstrate that NRE-Net significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Our approach achieves mAP50 improvements
of 7.9% and 6.1% over frame-based approaches (e.g., YOLOX), while surpassing
the fusion-based SFNet by 2.7% on the DSEC-Det-sub dataset and SODFormer by
7.1% on the PKU-DAVIS-SOD dataset.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于视频扩散增强的4D高斯泼溅框架，通过时间一致性和不确定性蒸馏提升动态场景建模效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法依赖预校准对象轨迹或难以准确建模快速移动对象，存在时间不连续性问题。

Method: 结合视频扩散模型提取时间一致性先验，引入联合时间戳优化和不确定性蒸馏方法。

Result: 显著提升动态建模效果，特别是快速移动对象，PSNR提升约2 dB。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了时间不连续性问题，提升了动态场景建模的精度。

Abstract: Dynamic urban scene modeling is a rapidly evolving area with broad
applications. While current approaches leveraging neural radiance fields or
Gaussian Splatting have achieved fine-grained reconstruction and high-fidelity
novel view synthesis, they still face significant limitations. These often stem
from a dependence on pre-calibrated object tracks or difficulties in accurately
modeling fast-moving objects from undersampled capture, particularly due to
challenges in handling temporal discontinuities. To overcome these issues, we
propose a novel video diffusion-enhanced 4D Gaussian Splatting framework. Our
key insight is to distill robust, temporally consistent priors from a test-time
adapted video diffusion model. To ensure precise pose alignment and effective
integration of this denoised content, we introduce two core innovations: a
joint timestamp optimization strategy that refines interpolated frame poses,
and an uncertainty distillation method that adaptively extracts target content
while preserving well-reconstructed regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method significantly enhances dynamic modeling, especially for
fast-moving objects, achieving an approximate PSNR gain of 2 dB for novel view
synthesis over baseline approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于感知的神经质量度量方法，用于直接评估BRDF模型的质量，无需渲染过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统BRDF空间度量方法无法捕捉渲染图像中的感知差异，需要一种更准确的评估方式。

Method: 使用多层感知机（MLP）训练，输入为参考和近似BRDF样本，预测其感知质量（JOD分数）。

Result: 新度量方法与人类判断的相关性显著高于现有BRDF空间度量。

Conclusion: 该度量方法为BRDF模型评估提供了基于感知的替代方案，尽管在BRDF拟合中表现有限。

Abstract: Accurately evaluating the quality of bidirectional reflectance distribution
function (BRDF) models is essential for photo-realistic rendering. Traditional
BRDF-space metrics often employ numerical error measures that fail to capture
perceptual differences evident in rendered images. In this paper, we introduce
the first perceptually informed neural quality metric for BRDF evaluation that
operates directly in BRDF space, eliminating the need for rendering during
quality assessment. Our metric is implemented as a compact multi-layer
perceptron (MLP), trained on a dataset of measured BRDFs supplemented with
synthetically generated data and labelled using a perceptually validated
image-space metric. The network takes as input paired samples of reference and
approximated BRDFs and predicts their perceptual quality in terms of
just-objectionable-difference (JOD) scores. We show that our neural metric
achieves significantly higher correlation with human judgments than existing
BRDF-space metrics. While its performance as a loss function for BRDF fitting
remains limited, the proposed metric offers a perceptually grounded alternative
for evaluating BRDF models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Free-MoRef是一种无需训练的方法，通过多参考注意力机制和并行处理长视频帧，显著提升视频多模态大语言模型（Video-MLLM）在长视频场景下的性能，同时保持高效推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Video-MLLM因底层LLM的上下文长度限制，在长视频场景中表现不佳，常见解决方案牺牲特征粒度或推理效率。

Method: 提出Free-MoRef，将视觉令牌重构为多个短序列作为多参考，通过MoRef-attention并行收集线索，并通过参考融合步骤生成最终推理序列。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，Free-MoRef实现了对2×至8×更长输入帧的全面感知，性能显著提升，甚至超过专门训练的长视频MLLM。

Conclusion: Free-MoRef通过分割和融合长视觉令牌序列，以较低计算成本实现高效长视频理解，展示了强大的效率和有效性。

Abstract: Video Multimodal Large Language Models~(Video-MLLM) have achieved remarkable
advancements in video understanding tasks. However, constrained by the context
length limitation in the underlying LLMs, existing Video-MLLMs typically
exhibit suboptimal performance on long video scenarios. To understand extended
input frames, common solutions span token compression and streaming inference
techniques, which sacrifice feature granularity or inference efficiency.
Differently, to efficiently achieve comprehensive understanding of longer frame
inputs, we draw ideas from MoE and propose a training-free approach
\textbf{Free-MoRef}, which instantly multiplexes the context perception
capabilities of Video-MLLMs within one inference pass. Specifically, Free-MoRef
reconstructs the vision tokens into several short sequences as
multi-references. Subsequently, we introduce MoRef-attention, which gathers
clues from the multi-reference chunks in parallel to summarize unified query
activations. After the shadow layers in LLMs, a reference fusion step is
derived to compose a final mixed reasoning sequence with key tokens from
parallel chunks, which compensates the cross-reference vision interactions that
are neglected in MoRef-attention. By splitting and fusing the long vision token
sequences, Free-MoRef achieves improved performance under much lower computing
costs in reasoning multiplexed context length, demonstrating strong efficiency
and effectiveness. Experiments on VideoMME, MLVU, LongVideoBench show that
Free-MoRef achieves full perception of 2$\times$ to 8$\times$ longer input
frames without compression on a single A100 GPU while keeping instant
responses, thereby bringing significant performance gains, even surpassing
dedicatedly trained long-video-MLLMs. Codes are available at

Method: 通过SLAM点云地图将航拍图像与nuScenes坐标系对齐，提出校正流程和人工质量控制，发布高质量对齐数据。

Result: 航拍图像在地图构建中提升15-23%的精度，在轨迹预测中提升2%的性能。

Conclusion: 航拍图像是自动驾驶系统中可扩展的环境信息源，AID4AD数据集支持未来研究。

Abstract: This work investigates the integration of spatially aligned aerial imagery
into perception tasks for automated vehicles (AVs). As a central contribution,
we present AID4AD, a publicly available dataset that augments the nuScenes
dataset with high-resolution aerial imagery precisely aligned to its local
coordinate system. The alignment is performed using SLAM-based point cloud maps
provided by nuScenes, establishing a direct link between aerial data and
nuScenes local coordinate system. To ensure spatial fidelity, we propose an
alignment workflow that corrects for localization and projection distortions. A
manual quality control process further refines the dataset by identifying a set
of high-quality alignments, which we publish as ground truth to support future
research on automated registration. We demonstrate the practical value of
AID4AD in two representative tasks: in online map construction, aerial imagery
serves as a complementary input that improves the mapping process; in motion
prediction, it functions as a structured environmental representation that
replaces high-definition maps. Experiments show that aerial imagery leads to a
15-23% improvement in map construction accuracy and a 2% gain in trajectory
prediction performance. These results highlight the potential of aerial imagery
as a scalable and adaptable source of environmental context in automated
vehicle systems, particularly in scenarios where high-definition maps are
unavailable, outdated, or costly to maintain. AID4AD, along with evaluation
code and pretrained models, is publicly released to foster further research in
this direction: https://github.com/DriverlessMobility/AID4AD.

Method: 提出TrackletGait框架，包括随机轨迹采样、Haar小波下采样和硬度排除三元组损失。

Result: 在Gait3D和GREW数据集上分别达到77.8和80.4的rank-1准确率，仅使用10.3M参数。

Conclusion: TrackletGait在真实场景中表现出色，为步态识别提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Gait recognition aims to identify individuals based on their body shape and
walking patterns. Though much progress has been achieved driven by deep
learning, gait recognition in real-world surveillance scenarios remains quite
challenging to current methods. Conventional approaches, which rely on periodic
gait cycles and controlled environments, struggle with the non-periodic and
occluded silhouette sequences encountered in the wild. In this paper, we
propose a novel framework, TrackletGait, designed to address these challenges
in the wild. We propose Random Tracklet Sampling, a generalization of existing
sampling methods, which strikes a balance between robustness and representation
in capturing diverse walking patterns. Next, we introduce Haar Wavelet-based
Downsampling to preserve information during spatial downsampling. Finally, we
present a Hardness Exclusion Triplet Loss, designed to exclude low-quality
silhouettes by discarding hard triplet samples. TrackletGait achieves
state-of-the-art results, with 77.8 and 80.4 rank-1 accuracy on the Gait3D and
GREW datasets, respectively, while using only 10.3M backbone parameters.
Extensive experiments are also conducted to further investigate the factors
affecting gait recognition in the wild.

Motivation: 现有方法缺乏真正的语义理解，且联合训练推理和分割会降低像素级精度。

Method: 采用结构化思维链提示和特征蒸馏损失，分两阶段训练：自校正增强推理路径质量，再通过GRPO强化学习提升鲁棒性。

Result: AURORA在Ref-AVS基准测试中达到最优性能，并能泛化到未引用分割任务。

Conclusion: AURORA通过增强推理和语言理解能力，显著提升了音频-视觉分割任务的性能。

Abstract: Reference Audio-Visual Segmentation (Ref-AVS) tasks challenge models to
precisely locate sounding objects by integrating visual, auditory, and textual
cues. Existing methods often lack genuine semantic understanding, tending to
memorize fixed reasoning patterns. Furthermore, jointly training for reasoning
and segmentation can compromise pixel-level precision. To address these issues,
we introduce AURORA, a novel framework designed to enhance genuine reasoning
and language comprehension in reference audio-visual segmentation. We employ a
structured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting mechanism to guide the model
through a step-by-step reasoning process and introduce a novel segmentation
feature distillation loss to effectively integrate these reasoning abilities
without sacrificing segmentation performance. To further cultivate the model's
genuine reasoning capabilities, we devise a further two-stage training
strategy: first, a ``corrective reflective-style training" stage utilizes
self-correction to enhance the quality of reasoning paths, followed by
reinforcement learning via Group Reward Policy Optimization (GRPO) to bolster
robustness in challenging scenarios. Experiments demonstrate that AURORA
achieves state-of-the-art performance on Ref-AVS benchmarks and generalizes
effectively to unreferenced segmentation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖模糊的文本提示或昂贵的人类偏好数据，难以实现美学属性的精细控制。

Method: 利用预训练视觉语言模型的语义相似性量化美学，并通过轻量级值编码器将标量强度映射到可学习嵌入中。

Result: AttriCtrl实现了对单个属性的精确控制和多属性的灵活组合，兼容现有生成框架。

Conclusion: AttriCtrl具有高效、灵活和实用的特点，适用于多样化的生成场景。

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in text-to-image diffusion models have significantly
enhanced both the visual fidelity and semantic controllability of generated
images. However, fine-grained control over aesthetic attributes remains
challenging, especially when users require continuous and intensity-specific
adjustments. Existing approaches often rely on vague textual prompts, which are
inherently ambiguous in expressing both the aesthetic semantics and the desired
intensity, or depend on costly human preference data for alignment, limiting
their scalability and practicality. To address these limitations, we propose
AttriCtrl, a plug-and-play framework for precise and continuous control of
aesthetic attributes. Specifically, we quantify abstract aesthetics by
leveraging semantic similarity from pre-trained vision-language models, and
employ a lightweight value encoder that maps scalar intensities in $[0,1]$ to
learnable embeddings within diffusion-based generation. This design enables
intuitive and customizable aesthetic manipulation, with minimal training
overhead and seamless integration into existing generation pipelines. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that AttriCtrl achieves accurate control over
individual attributes as well as flexible multi-attribute composition.
Moreover, it is fully compatible with popular open-source controllable
generation frameworks, showcasing strong integration capability and practical
utility across diverse generation scenarios.

Conclusion: 提出的CP框架方法高效且无需手动调参，适用于卷积稀疏表示任务。

Abstract: Recently convolutional sparse representation (CSR), as a sparse
representation technique, has attracted increasing attention in the field of
image processing, due to its good characteristic of translate-invariance. The
content of CSR usually consists of convolutional sparse coding (CSC) and
convolutional dictionary learning (CDL), and many studies focus on how to solve
the corresponding optimization problems. At present, the most efficient
optimization scheme for CSC is based on the alternating direction method of
multipliers (ADMM). However, the ADMM-based approach involves a penalty
parameter that needs to be carefully selected, and improper parameter selection
may result in either no convergence or very slow convergence. In this paper, a
novel fast and efficient method using Chambolle-Pock(CP) framework is proposed,
which does not require extra manual selection parameters in solving processing,
and has faster convergence speed. Furthermore, we propose an anisotropic total
variation penalty of the coefficient maps for CSC and apply the CP algorithm to
solve it. In addition, we also apply the CP framework to solve the
corresponding CDL problem. Experiments show that for noise-free image the
proposed CSC algorithms can achieve rival results of the latest ADMM-based
approach, while outperforms in removing noise from Gaussian noise pollution
image.

Conclusion: DreamPainter框架和DreamEcom-400K数据集有效解决了电商背景生成任务中的关键问题。

Abstract: Although diffusion-based image genenation has been widely explored and
applied, background generation tasks in e-commerce scenarios still face
significant challenges. The first challenge is to ensure that the generated
products are consistent with the given product inputs while maintaining a
reasonable spatial arrangement, harmonious shadows, and reflections between
foreground products and backgrounds. Existing inpainting methods fail to
address this due to the lack of domain-specific data. The second challenge
involves the limitation of relying solely on text prompts for image control, as
effective integrating visual information to achieve precise control in
inpainting tasks remains underexplored. To address these challenges, we
introduce DreamEcom-400K, a high-quality e-commerce dataset containing accurate
product instance masks, background reference images, text prompts, and
aesthetically pleasing product images. Based on this dataset, we propose
DreamPainter, a novel framework that not only utilizes text prompts for control
but also flexibly incorporates reference image information as an additional
control signal. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, maintaining high product
consistency while effectively integrating both text prompt and reference image
information.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统方法依赖RGB-D输入或两阶段模型的问题，提出更高效和鲁棒的解决方案。

Method: 利用神经网格模型与学习特征，结合多模型RANSAC，构建统一框架。

Result: 在REAL275数据集上，RGB类别级姿态估计的性能提升了22.9%，且鲁棒性更强。

Conclusion: 统一模型在RGB图像上的检测和姿态估计任务中表现出色，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Recognizing objects in images is a fundamental problem in computer vision.
Although detecting objects in 2D images is common, many applications require
determining their pose in 3D space. Traditional category-level methods rely on
RGB-D inputs, which may not always be available, or employ two-stage approaches
that use separate models and representations for detection and pose estimation.
For the first time, we introduce a unified model that integrates detection and
pose estimation into a single framework for RGB images by leveraging neural
mesh models with learned features and multi-model RANSAC. Our approach achieves
state-of-the-art results for RGB category-level pose estimation on REAL275,
improving on the current state-of-the-art by 22.9% averaged across all
scale-agnostic metrics. Finally, we demonstrate that our unified method
exhibits greater robustness compared to single-stage baselines. Our code and
models are available at

TL;DR: EST-LoRA是一种无需训练的LoRA融合方法，通过综合考虑矩阵能量、风格差异分数和时间步长，自适应选择主题和风格LoRA，实现平衡生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以平衡主题和风格，且需要额外训练；K-LoRA虽无需训练但涉及复杂超参数。

Method: 提出EST-LoRA，基于矩阵能量、风格差异和时间步长，类似MoE架构自适应选择LoRA。

Result: 实验表明EST-LoRA在质量和速度上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: EST-LoRA无需训练，高效平衡主题和风格，生成效果更优。

Abstract: Fine-tuning models via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) demonstrates remarkable
performance in subject-driven or style-driven generation tasks. Studies have
explored combinations of different LoRAs to jointly generate learned styles and
content. However, current methods struggle to balance the original subject and
style, and often require additional training. Recently, K-LoRA proposed a
training-free LoRA fusion method. But it involves multiple hyperparameters,
making it difficult to adapt to all styles and subjects. In this paper, we
propose EST-LoRA, a training-free adaptive LoRA fusion method. It
comprehensively considers three critical factors: \underline{E}nergy of matrix,
\underline{S}tyle discrepancy scores and \underline{T}ime steps. Analogous to
the Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture, the model adaptively selects between
subject LoRA and style LoRA within each attention layer. This integrated
selection mechanism ensures balanced contributions from both components during
the generation process. Experimental results show that EST-LoRA outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations and
achieves faster generation speed compared to other efficient fusion approaches.

TL;DR: 论文提出了CL3AN数据集和学习框架，用于解决复杂光照下图像恢复的问题，通过显式色度和亮度引导实现光照与反射的分离。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常假设单一光源或均匀光照，无法处理复杂光照场景（如多色光源、遮挡等），导致恢复图像出现伪影。

Method: 提出了一种基于Retinex模型的学习框架，利用显式色度和亮度组件指导，实现光照与反射的精确分离。

Result: 在现有基准和CL3AN数据集上的评估表明，该方法在非均匀彩色光照和材料反射变化下具有更强的鲁棒性，且计算成本低。

Conclusion: CL3AN数据集和提出的学习框架为复杂光照下的图像恢复提供了有效解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Illumination in practical scenarios is inherently complex, involving colored
light sources, occlusions, and diverse material interactions that produce
intricate reflectance and shading effects. However, existing methods often
oversimplify this challenge by assuming a single light source or uniform,
white-balanced lighting, leaving many of these complexities unaddressed.In this
paper, we introduce CL3AN, the first large-scale, high-resolution dataset of
its kind designed to facilitate the restoration of images captured under
multiple Colored Light sources to their Ambient-Normalized counterparts.
Through benchmarking, we find that leading approaches often produce artifacts,
such as illumination inconsistencies, texture leakage, and color distortion,
primarily due to their limited ability to precisely disentangle illumination
from reflectance. Motivated by this insight, we achieve such a desired
decomposition through a novel learning framework that leverages explicit
chromaticity and luminance components guidance, drawing inspiration from the
principles of the Retinex model. Extensive evaluations on existing benchmarks
and our dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, showcasing
enhanced robustness under non-homogeneous color lighting and material-specific
reflectance variations, all while maintaining a highly competitive
computational cost. The benchmark, codes, and models are available at

Motivation: 现有自监督预训练方法在3D场景理解中存在模型崩溃和结构信息不足的问题，导致表达不可靠和性能不佳。

Method: 提出GaussianCross，结合3D高斯喷洒技术，将点云转换为统一的高斯表示，并通过三属性自适应蒸馏喷洒模块构建3D特征场。

Conclusion: GaussianCross在3D表示学习中具有高效性和强泛化能力，显著提升了语义和实例分割任务的性能。

Abstract: The significance of informative and robust point representations has been
widely acknowledged for 3D scene understanding. Despite existing
self-supervised pre-training counterparts demonstrating promising performance,
the model collapse and structural information deficiency remain prevalent due
to insufficient point discrimination difficulty, yielding unreliable
expressions and suboptimal performance. In this paper, we present
GaussianCross, a novel cross-modal self-supervised 3D representation learning
architecture integrating feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) techniques
to address current challenges. GaussianCross seamlessly converts
scale-inconsistent 3D point clouds into a unified cuboid-normalized Gaussian
representation without missing details, enabling stable and generalizable
pre-training. Subsequently, a tri-attribute adaptive distillation splatting
module is incorporated to construct a 3D feature field, facilitating synergetic
feature capturing of appearance, geometry, and semantic cues to maintain
cross-modal consistency. To validate GaussianCross, we perform extensive
evaluations on various benchmarks, including ScanNet, ScanNet200, and S3DIS. In
particular, GaussianCross shows a prominent parameter and data efficiency,
achieving superior performance through linear probing (<0.1% parameters) and
limited data training (1% of scenes) compared to state-of-the-art methods.
Furthermore, GaussianCross demonstrates strong generalization capabilities,
improving the full fine-tuning accuracy by 9.3% mIoU and 6.1% AP$_{50}$ on
ScanNet200 semantic and instance segmentation tasks, respectively, supporting
the effectiveness of our approach. The code, weights, and visualizations are

Conclusion: 开发的Python算法灵活且可定制，适用于日常使用和研究，代码已开源。

Abstract: Background : De-identification of DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communi-cations
in Medicine) files is an essential component of medical image research.
Personal Identifiable Information (PII) and/or Personal Health Identifying
Information (PHI) need to be hidden or removed due to legal reasons. According
to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and privacy
rules, also full-face photographic images and any compa-rable images are direct
identifiers and are considered protected health information that also need to
be de-identified. Objective : The study aimed to implement a method that permit
to de-identify the PII and PHI information present in the header and burned on
the pixel data of DICOM. Methods : To execute the de-identification, we
implemented an algorithm based on the safe harbor method, defined by HIPAA. Our
algorithm uses input customizable parameter to classify and then possibly
de-identify individual DICOM tags. Results : The most sensible information,
like names, history, personal data and institution were successfully
recognized. Conclusions : We developed a python algorithm that is able to
classify infor-mation present in a DICOM file. The flexibility provided by the
use of customi-zable input parameters, which allow the user to customize the
entire process de-pending on the case (e.g., the language), makes the entire
program very promis-ing for both everyday use and research purposes. Our code

Motivation: Deepfake视频的传播引发信任危机，现有方法在弱监督多模态细粒度时间伪造定位（WS-MTFL）方面缺乏系统性研究。

Method: 通过多任务学习整合视觉和音频模态检测任务，采用专家混合结构自适应选择特征和定位头，并提出特征增强模块和可扩展偏差感知损失。

Result: WMMT在WS-MTFL中表现出色，多项指标媲美全监督方法。

Conclusion: 多任务学习在WS-MTFL中有效，WMMT为弱监督定位提供了灵活且精确的解决方案。

Abstract: The spread of Deepfake videos has caused a trust crisis and impaired social
stability. Although numerous approaches have been proposed to address the
challenges of Deepfake detection and localization, there is still a lack of
systematic research on the weakly supervised multimodal fine-grained temporal
forgery localization (WS-MTFL). In this paper, we propose a novel weakly
supervised multimodal temporal forgery localization via multitask learning
(WMMT), which addresses the WS-MTFL under the multitask learning paradigm. WMMT
achieves multimodal fine-grained Deepfake detection and temporal partial
forgery localization using merely video-level annotations. Specifically, visual
and audio modality detection are formulated as two binary classification tasks.
The multitask learning paradigm is introduced to integrate these tasks into a
multimodal task. Furthermore, WMMT utilizes a Mixture-of-Experts structure to
adaptively select appropriate features and localization head, achieving
excellent flexibility and localization precision in WS-MTFL. A feature
enhancement module with temporal property preserving attention mechanism is
proposed to identify the intra- and inter-modality feature deviation and
construct comprehensive video features. To further explore the temporal
information for weakly supervised learning, an extensible deviation perceiving
loss has been proposed, which aims to enlarge the deviation of adjacent
segments of the forged samples and reduce the deviation of genuine samples.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of multitask learning for
WS-MTFL, and the WMMT achieves comparable results to fully supervised
approaches in several evaluation metrics.

Motivation: 量化模型在动态环境中性能下降严重，现有测试时适应（TTA）方法因依赖梯度反向传播而不适用于量化模型，亟需一种高效适应方法。

Method: 提出ZOA框架，仅需两次前向传播实现模型适应，并设计域知识管理方案以减少不同域知识的干扰。

Result: 在量化W6A6 ViT-B模型上，ZOA在ImageNet-C数据集上比现有方法提升5.0%。

Conclusion: ZOA为量化模型提供了一种高效且鲁棒的适应方法，显著提升了其在动态环境中的性能。

Abstract: Quantizing deep models prior to deployment is a widely adopted technique to
speed up inference for various real-time applications, such as autonomous
driving. However, quantized models often suffer from severe performance
degradation in dynamic environments with potential domain shifts and this
degradation is significantly more pronounced compared with their full-precision
counterparts, as shown by our theoretical and empirical illustrations. To
address the domain shift problem, test-time adaptation (TTA) has emerged as an
effective solution by enabling models to learn adaptively from test data.
Unfortunately, existing TTA methods are often impractical for quantized models
as they typically rely on gradient backpropagation--an operation that is
unsupported on quantized models due to vanishing gradients, as well as memory
and latency constraints. In this paper, we focus on TTA for quantized models to
improve their robustness and generalization ability efficiently. We propose a
continual zeroth-order adaptation (ZOA) framework that enables efficient model
adaptation using only two forward passes, eliminating the computational burden
of existing methods. Moreover, we propose a domain knowledge management scheme
to store and reuse different domain knowledge with negligible memory
consumption, reducing the interference of different domain knowledge and
fostering the knowledge accumulation during long-term adaptation. Experimental
results on three classical architectures, including quantized transformer-based
and CNN-based models, demonstrate the superiority of our methods for quantized
model adaptation. On the quantized W6A6 ViT-B model, our ZOA is able to achieve
a 5.0\% improvement over the state-of-the-art FOA on ImageNet-C dataset. The

Motivation: 揭示对抗训练中硬对抗样本的过度学习是导致决策边界退化的原因，而非传统认为的不足学习。

Method: 定义了新的对抗训练目标Robust Perception，提出RPAT方法，鼓励模型感知随输入扰动平滑变化。

Result: 在多个数据集和模型上验证了RPAT的有效性，超越了多个基线方法和SOTA工作。

Conclusion: RPAT通过优化感知一致性，显著改善了对抗训练中的权衡问题。

Abstract: Adversarial Training (AT) is one of the most effective methods to train
robust Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). However, AT creates an inherent trade-off
between clean accuracy and adversarial robustness, which is commonly attributed
to the more complicated decision boundary caused by the insufficient learning
of hard adversarial samples. In this work, we reveal a counterintuitive fact
for the first time: From the perspective of perception consistency, hard
adversarial samples that can still attack the robust model after AT are already
learned better than those successfully defended. Thus, different from previous
views, we argue that it is rather the over-sufficient learning of hard
adversarial samples that degrades the decision boundary and contributes to the
trade-off problem. Specifically, the excessive pursuit of perception
consistency would force the model to view the perturbations as noise and ignore
the information within them, which should have been utilized to induce a
smoother perception transition towards the decision boundary to support its
establishment to an appropriate location. In response, we define a new AT
objective named Robust Perception, encouraging the model perception to change
smoothly with input perturbations, based on which we propose a novel Robust
Perception Adversarial Training (RPAT) method, effectively mitigating the
current accuracy-robustness trade-off. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and
Tiny-ImageNet with ResNet-18, PreActResNet-18, and WideResNet-34-10 demonstrate
the effectiveness of our method beyond four common baselines and 12

Motivation: 传统Mamba因固定扫描方式无法动态利用内容依赖，限制了性能。

Result: CMIC模型在多个基准测试中BD-rate显著优于VTM-21.0。

Conclusion: CAM有效提升LIC的全局依赖捕捉能力，同时保持计算效率。

Abstract: Recent Learned image compression (LIC) leverages Mamba-style state-space
models (SSMs) for global receptive fields with linear complexity. However,
vanilla Mamba is content-agnostic, relying on fixed and predefined selective
scans, which restricts its ability to dynamically and fully exploit content
dependencies. We introduce Content-Adaptive Mamba (CAM), a dynamic SSM that
addresses two critical limitations. First, it employs content-aware token
reorganization, clustering and reordering tokens based on content similarity to
prioritize proximity in feature space over Euclidean space. Second, it
integrates global priors into SSM via a prompt dictionary, effectively
mitigating the strict causality and long-range decay in the token interactions
of Mamba. These innovations enable CAM to better capture global dependencies
while preserving computational efficiency. Leveraging CAM, our Content-Adaptive
Mamba-based LIC model (CMIC) achieves state-of-the-art rate-distortion
performance, surpassing VTM-21.0 by -15.91\%, -21.34\%, and -17.58\% BD-rate on
Kodak, Tecnick, and CLIC benchmarks, respectively.

Result: 在七个器官的WSI数据集上测试，COSFormer在性能和泛化能力上优于现有框架。

Conclusion: COSFormer是临床WSI分析中高效且强大的持续学习解决方案。

Abstract: Whole Slide Image (WSI) analysis, with its ability to reveal detailed tissue
structures in magnified views, plays a crucial role in cancer diagnosis and
prognosis. Due to their giga-sized nature, WSIs require substantial storage and
computational resources for processing and training predictive models. With the
rapid increase in WSIs used in clinics and hospitals, there is a growing need
for a continual learning system that can efficiently process and adapt existing
models to new tasks without retraining or fine-tuning on previous tasks. Such a
system must balance resource efficiency with high performance. In this study,
we introduce COSFormer, a Transformer-based continual learning framework
tailored for multi-task WSI analysis. COSFormer is designed to learn
sequentially from new tasks wile avoiding the need to revisit full historical
datasets. We evaluate COSFormer on a sequence of seven WSI datasets covering
seven organs and six WSI-related tasks under both class-incremental and
task-incremental settings. The results demonstrate COSFormer's superior
generalizability and effectiveness compared to existing continual learning
frameworks, establishing it as a robust solution for continual WSI analysis in
clinical applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如TaylorSeer）在模块级别预测特征时存在内存和计算开销大的问题，且固定缓存机制无法适应不同时间步的预测准确性，导致输出质量下降。

Method: 将泰勒预测目标从模块级别转移到最后一个块级别，减少缓存特征数量；利用第一个块的预测误差动态决定是否信任泰勒预测，实现动态缓存。

Result: 在FLUX、DiT和Wan Video上分别实现了3.17倍、2.36倍和4.14倍的加速，且质量损失可忽略。

Conclusion: 该方法在速度和生成质量之间取得了更好的平衡，适用于低资源应用场景。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in
visual generation tasks. However, their low inference speed limits their
deployment in low-resource applications. Recent training-free approaches
exploit the redundancy of features across timesteps by caching and reusing past
representations to accelerate inference. Building on this idea, TaylorSeer
instead uses cached features to predict future ones via Taylor expansion.
However, its module-level prediction across all transformer blocks (e.g.,
attention or feedforward modules) requires storing fine-grained intermediate
features, leading to notable memory and computation overhead. Moreover, it
adopts a fixed caching schedule without considering the varying accuracy of
predictions across timesteps, which can lead to degraded outputs when
prediction fails. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach to
better leverage Taylor-based acceleration. First, we shift the Taylor
prediction target from the module level to the last block level, significantly
reducing the number of cached features. Furthermore, observing strong
sequential dependencies among Transformer blocks, we propose to use the error
between the Taylor-estimated and actual outputs of the first block as an
indicator of prediction reliability. If the error is small, we trust the Taylor
prediction for the last block; otherwise, we fall back to full computation,
thereby enabling a dynamic caching mechanism. Empirical results show that our
method achieves a better balance between speed and quality, achieving a 3.17x
acceleration on FLUX, 2.36x on DiT, and 4.14x on Wan Video with negligible
quality drop. The Project Page is

Conclusion: I2CR框架通过文本优先和视觉辅助策略，显著提升了多模态实体链接的性能。

Abstract: Multimodal entity linking plays a crucial role in a wide range of
applications. Recent advances in large language model-based methods have become
the dominant paradigm for this task, effectively leveraging both textual and
visual modalities to enhance performance. Despite their success, these methods
still face two challenges, including unnecessary incorporation of image data in
certain scenarios and the reliance only on a one-time extraction of visual
features, which can undermine their effectiveness and accuracy. To address
these challenges, we propose a novel LLM-based framework for the multimodal
entity linking task, called Intra- and Inter-modal Collaborative Reflections.
This framework prioritizes leveraging text information to address the task.
When text alone is insufficient to link the correct entity through intra- and
inter-modality evaluations, it employs a multi-round iterative strategy that
integrates key visual clues from various aspects of the image to support
reasoning and enhance matching accuracy. Extensive experiments on three widely
used public datasets demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms
current state-of-the-art methods in the task, achieving improvements of 3.2%,
5.1%, and 1.6%, respectively. Our code is available at

Conclusion: DerProp通过导数标签传播有效解决了伪标签不可靠的问题，提升了半监督语义分割的性能。

Abstract: Semi-supervised semantic segmentation, which leverages a limited set of
labeled images, helps to relieve the heavy annotation burden. While
pseudo-labeling strategies yield promising results, there is still room for
enhancing the reliability of pseudo-labels. Hence, we develop a semi-supervised
framework, namely DerProp, equipped with a novel derivative label propagation
to rectify imperfect pseudo-labels. Our label propagation method imposes
discrete derivative operations on pixel-wise feature vectors as additional
regularization, thereby generating strictly regularized similarity metrics.
Doing so effectively alleviates the ill-posed problem that identical
similarities correspond to different features, through constraining the
solution space. Extensive experiments are conducted to verify the rationality
of our design, and demonstrate our superiority over other methods. Codes are

Conclusion: Patho-AgenticRAG通过多模态检索和推理能力，有效解决了病理学中的幻觉问题，提升了诊断准确性。

Abstract: Although Vision Language Models (VLMs) have shown strong generalization in
medical imaging, pathology presents unique challenges due to ultra-high
resolution, complex tissue structures, and nuanced clinical semantics. These
factors make pathology VLMs prone to hallucinations, i.e., generating outputs
inconsistent with visual evidence, which undermines clinical trust. Existing
RAG approaches in this domain largely depend on text-based knowledge bases,
limiting their ability to leverage diagnostic visual cues. To address this, we
propose Patho-AgenticRAG, a multimodal RAG framework with a database built on
page-level embeddings from authoritative pathology textbooks. Unlike
traditional text-only retrieval systems, it supports joint text-image search,
enabling direct retrieval of textbook pages that contain both the queried text
and relevant visual cues, thus avoiding the loss of critical image-based
information. Patho-AgenticRAG also supports reasoning, task decomposition, and

*Rui Qian,Haozhi Cao,Tianchen Deng,Shenghai Yuan,Lihua Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SplatSSC提出了一种基于深度引导初始化和高斯聚合器的单目3D语义场景补全框架，显著提升了效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有基于3D高斯基元的对象中心方法中随机初始化导致的低效和异常基元问题。

Method: 采用深度引导初始化策略（GMF模块）和解耦高斯聚合器（DGA），结合概率尺度损失。

Result: 在Occ-ScanNet数据集上，IoU和mIoU分别提升6.3%和4.1%，延迟和内存消耗降低9.3%。

Conclusion: SplatSSC通过改进初始化和聚合策略，实现了高效且鲁棒的3D语义场景补全。

Abstract: Monocular 3D Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) is a challenging yet promising
task that aims to infer dense geometric and semantic descriptions of a scene
from a single image. While recent object-centric paradigms significantly
improve efficiency by leveraging flexible 3D Gaussian primitives, they still
rely heavily on a large number of randomly initialized primitives, which
inevitably leads to 1) inefficient primitive initialization and 2) outlier
primitives that introduce erroneous artifacts. In this paper, we propose
SplatSSC, a novel framework that resolves these limitations with a depth-guided
initialization strategy and a principled Gaussian aggregator. Instead of random
initialization, SplatSSC utilizes a dedicated depth branch composed of a
Group-wise Multi-scale Fusion (GMF) module, which integrates multi-scale image
and depth features to generate a sparse yet representative set of initial
Gaussian primitives. To mitigate noise from outlier primitives, we develop the
Decoupled Gaussian Aggregator (DGA), which enhances robustness by decomposing
geometric and semantic predictions during the Gaussian-to-voxel splatting
process. Complemented with a specialized Probability Scale Loss, our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Occ-ScanNet dataset, outperforming
prior approaches by over 6.3% in IoU and 4.1% in mIoU, while reducing both
latency and memory consumption by more than 9.3%. The code will be released
upon acceptance.

*Peng Zhang,Zhihui Lai,Heng Kong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Hermes的半监督双阈值对比学习策略，用于超声图像分类和分割，解决了伪标签选择和任务间信息共享的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于置信度的伪标签选择容易产生过度自信但错误的预测，且分割和分类任务独立处理，未能充分利用任务间关联。

Method: 结合对比学习和半监督学习，引入任务间注意力和显著性模块，设计任务间一致性学习策略，并收集了SZ-TUS数据集。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，Hermes在半监督设置下优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Hermes通过改进伪标签选择和任务间协作，提升了超声图像分类和分割的性能。

Abstract: Confidence-based pseudo-label selection usually generates overly confident
yet incorrect predictions, due to the early misleadingness of model and
overfitting inaccurate pseudo-labels in the learning process, which heavily
degrades the performance of semi-supervised contrastive learning. Moreover,
segmentation and classification tasks are treated independently and the
affinity fails to be fully explored. To address these issues, we propose a
novel semi-supervised dual-threshold contrastive learning strategy for
ultrasound image classification and segmentation, named Hermes. This strategy
combines the strengths of contrastive learning with semi-supervised learning,
where the pseudo-labels assist contrastive learning by providing additional
guidance. Specifically, an inter-task attention and saliency module is also
developed to facilitate information sharing between the segmentation and
classification tasks. Furthermore, an inter-task consistency learning strategy
is designed to align tumor features across both tasks, avoiding negative
transfer for reducing features discrepancy. To solve the lack of publicly
available ultrasound datasets, we have collected the SZ-TUS dataset, a thyroid
ultrasound image dataset. Extensive experiments on two public ultrasound
datasets and one private dataset demonstrate that Hermes consistently
outperforms several state-of-the-art methods across various semi-supervised
settings.

TL;DR: SGAD提出了一种新的语义和几何感知描述符网络，显著提高了区域匹配的准确性和效率，并通过分类和排序子任务以及HCRF进一步优化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于A2PM的方法依赖于低效的像素级比较和复杂的图匹配，限制了可扩展性。

Method: SGAD通过生成高区分度的区域描述符直接匹配，避免了复杂的图优化，并采用分类和排序监督策略以及HCRF过滤重叠区域。

Result: SGAD在运行时间上比MESA快60倍，且在多个点匹配器中表现优异，如SGAD+LoFTR在户外姿态估计中更快更准确，SGAD+ROMA在室内姿态估计中AUC@5°提升7.39%。

Conclusion: SGAD通过创新的描述符和监督策略，显著提升了区域匹配的性能和效率，成为新的SOTA方法。

Abstract: Local feature matching remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision.
Recent Area to Point Matching (A2PM) methods have improved matching accuracy.
However, existing research based on this framework relies on inefficient
pixel-level comparisons and complex graph matching that limit scalability. In
this work, we introduce the Semantic and Geometric-aware Descriptor Network
(SGAD), which fundamentally rethinks area-based matching by generating highly
discriminative area descriptors that enable direct matching without complex
graph optimization. This approach significantly improves both accuracy and
efficiency of area matching. We further improve the performance of area
matching through a novel supervision strategy that decomposes the area matching
task into classification and ranking subtasks. Finally, we introduce the
Hierarchical Containment Redundancy Filter (HCRF) to eliminate overlapping
areas by analyzing containment graphs. SGAD demonstrates remarkable performance
gains, reducing runtime by 60x (0.82s vs. 60.23s) compared to MESA. Extensive
evaluations show consistent improvements across multiple point matchers:
SGAD+LoFTR reduces runtime compared to DKM, while achieving higher accuracy
(0.82s vs. 1.51s, 65.98 vs. 61.11) in outdoor pose estimation, and SGAD+ROMA
delivers +7.39% AUC@5{\deg} in indoor pose estimation, establishing a new
state-of-the-art.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割对疾病诊断和治疗规划至关重要，但现有方法在跨模态分割性能上存在不足，尤其是边缘信息的作用未被系统研究。

Method: 研究训练了两个版本的基础模型，分别基于原始数据和边缘增强数据，并通过元学习策略选择最佳预处理方式。

Conclusion: 选择性应用边缘增强预处理并结合元学习策略，可显著提升医学图像分割的跨模态性能。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is crucial for disease diagnosis and treatment
planning, yet developing robust segmentation models often requires substantial
computational resources and large datasets. Existing research shows that
pre-trained and finetuned foundation models can boost segmentation performance.
However, questions remain about how particular image preprocessing steps may
influence segmentation performance across different medical imaging modalities.
In particular, edges-abrupt transitions in pixel intensity-are widely
acknowledged as vital cues for object boundaries but have not been
systematically examined in the pre-training of foundation models. We address
this gap by investigating to which extend pre-training with data processed
using computationally efficient edge kernels, such as kirsch, can improve
cross-modality segmentation capabilities of a foundation model. Two versions of
a foundation model are first trained on either raw or edge-enhanced data across
multiple medical imaging modalities, then finetuned on selected raw subsets
tailored to specific medical modalities. After systematic investigation using
the medical domains Dermoscopy, Fundus, Mammography, Microscopy, OCT, US, and
XRay, we discover both increased and reduced segmentation performance across
modalities using edge-focused pre-training, indicating the need for a selective
application of this approach. To guide such selective applications, we propose
a meta-learning strategy. It uses standard deviation and image entropy of the
raw image to choose between a model pre-trained on edge-enhanced or on raw data
for optimal performance. Our experiments show that integrating this
meta-learning layer yields an overall segmentation performance improvement
across diverse medical imaging tasks by 16.42% compared to models pre-trained
on edge-enhanced data only and 19.30% compared to models pre-trained on raw
data only.

Motivation: 传统LiDAR和RGB相机在高动态场景中存在感知间隙，而现有事件相机与常规传感器的融合方法在快速运动场景中表现不佳。

Method: 提出了一种仅使用事件相机的立体3D检测框架，引入双滤波机制提取语义和几何信息，并通过目标中心信息对齐边界框来增强回归。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在动态环境中优于现有方法，证明了事件相机在连续时间3D感知中的潜力。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了事件相机在无需传统3D传感器的情况下实现鲁棒3D感知的潜力。

Abstract: 3D object detection is essential for autonomous systems, enabling precise
localization and dimension estimation. While LiDAR and RGB cameras are widely
used, their fixed frame rates create perception gaps in high-speed scenarios.
Event cameras, with their asynchronous nature and high temporal resolution,
offer a solution by capturing motion continuously. The recent approach, which
integrates event cameras with conventional sensors for continuous-time
detection, struggles in fast-motion scenarios due to its dependency on
synchronized sensors. We propose a novel stereo 3D object detection framework
that relies solely on event cameras, eliminating the need for conventional 3D
sensors. To compensate for the lack of semantic and geometric information in
event data, we introduce a dual filter mechanism that extracts both.
Additionally, we enhance regression by aligning bounding boxes with
object-centric information. Experiments show that our method outperforms prior
approaches in dynamic environments, demonstrating the potential of event
cameras for robust, continuous-time 3D perception. The code is available at

TL;DR: CoMet是一种新的训练策略，用于深度异常检测模型，无需手动筛选数据，通过结合Soft Confident Learning和Meta-Learning，提高模型对噪声数据的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统无监督异常检测需要手动筛选数据，引入偏差且适应性差。CoMet旨在解决这一问题，允许模型从未经筛选的数据中学习。

Method: CoMet结合Soft Confident Learning（降低低置信度样本权重）和Meta-Learning（基于验证损失协方差稳定训练），防止过拟合并增强鲁棒性。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，CoMet优于基线方法，对训练集中的异常不敏感，并在所有数据集上达到新的最优性能。

Conclusion: CoMet是一种模型无关的方法，显著提升了深度异常检测模型的性能，适用于实际应用中的未筛选数据。

Abstract: So-called unsupervised anomaly detection is better described as
semi-supervised, as it assumes all training data are nominal. This assumption
simplifies training but requires manual data curation, introducing bias and
limiting adaptability. We propose Confident Meta-learning (CoMet), a novel
training strategy that enables deep anomaly detection models to learn from
uncurated datasets where nominal and anomalous samples coexist, eliminating the
need for explicit filtering. Our approach integrates Soft Confident Learning,
which assigns lower weights to low-confidence samples, and Meta-Learning, which
stabilizes training by regularizing updates based on training validation loss
covariance. This prevents overfitting and enhances robustness to noisy data.
CoMet is model-agnostic and can be applied to any anomaly detection method
trainable via gradient descent. Experiments on MVTec-AD, VIADUCT, and KSDD2
with two state-of-the-art models demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach,
consistently improving over the baseline methods, remaining insensitive to
anomalies in the training set, and setting a new state-of-the-art across all
datasets.

Result: 在心血管疾病、糖尿病、慢性阻塞性肺病和慢性肾病等多种疾病中表现优于传统全身放射组学方法。

Conclusion: 该方法可作为独立筛查工具或多模态框架的一部分，具有早期个性化风险分层的临床潜力。

Abstract: Reliable preclinical disease risk assessment is essential to move public
healthcare from reactive treatment to proactive identification and prevention.
However, image-based risk prediction algorithms often consider one condition at
a time and depend on hand-crafted features obtained through segmentation tools.
We propose a whole-body self-supervised representation learning method for the
preclinical disease risk assessment under a competing risk modeling. This
approach outperforms whole-body radiomics in multiple diseases, including
cardiovascular disease (CVD), type 2 diabetes (T2D), chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Simulating a
preclinical screening scenario and subsequently combining with cardiac MRI, it
sharpens further the prediction for CVD subgroups: ischemic heart disease
(IHD), hypertensive diseases (HD), and stroke. The results indicate the
translational potential of whole-body representations as a standalone screening
modality and as part of a multi-modal framework within clinical workflows for
early personalized risk stratification. The code is available at

Motivation: AI在医疗领域应用时存在误分类风险，需与人类专家协作以确保安全。研究旨在探索更鲁棒的延迟决策方法。

Method: 通过大型眼科数据集评估学习延迟模型和不确定性量化方法，比较它们在分布内和分布外数据上的表现。

Result: 不确定性量化方法在分布外数据上表现更优，更适合作为AI延迟决策策略。

Conclusion: 不确定性量化方法在AI延迟决策中具有潜力，尤其在面对数据偏移时表现更稳健。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) holds the potential to dramatically improve
patient care. However, it is not infallible, necessitating
human-AI-collaboration to ensure safe implementation. One aspect of AI safety
is the models' ability to defer decisions to a human expert when they are
likely to misclassify autonomously. Recent research has focused on methods that
learn to defer by optimising a surrogate loss function that finds the optimal
trade-off between predicting a class label or deferring. However, during
clinical translation, models often face challenges such as data shift.
Uncertainty quantification methods aim to estimate a model's confidence in its
predictions. However, they may also be used as a deferral strategy which does
not rely on learning from specific training distribution. We hypothesise that
models developed to quantify uncertainty are more robust to out-of-distribution
(OOD) input than learned deferral models that have been trained in a supervised
fashion. To investigate this hypothesis, we constructed an extensive evaluation
study on a large ophthalmology dataset, examining both learned deferral models
and established uncertainty quantification methods, assessing their performance
in- and out-of-distribution. Specifically, we evaluate their ability to
accurately classify glaucoma from fundus images while deferring cases with a
high likelihood of error. We find that uncertainty quantification methods may
be a promising choice for AI deferral.

Conclusion: 逻辑驱动的约束有效提升了零样本组合动作识别的性能。

Abstract: Zero-shot compositional action recognition (ZS-CAR) aims to identify unseen
verb-object compositions in the videos by exploiting the learned knowledge of
verb and object primitives during training. Despite compositional learning's
progress in ZS-CAR, two critical challenges persist: 1) Missing compositional
structure constraint, leading to spurious correlations between primitives; 2)
Neglecting semantic hierarchy constraint, leading to semantic ambiguity and
impairing the training process. In this paper, we argue that human-like
symbolic reasoning offers a principled solution to these challenges by
explicitly modeling compositional and hierarchical structured abstraction. To
this end, we propose a logic-driven ZS-CAR framework LogicCAR that integrates
dual symbolic constraints: Explicit Compositional Logic and Hierarchical
Primitive Logic. Specifically, the former models the restrictions within the
compositions, enhancing the compositional reasoning ability of our model. The
latter investigates the semantical dependencies among different primitives,
empowering the models with fine-to-coarse reasoning capacity. By formalizing
these constraints in first-order logic and embedding them into neural network
architectures, LogicCAR systematically bridges the gap between symbolic
abstraction and existing models. Extensive experiments on the Sth-com dataset
demonstrate that our LogicCAR outperforms existing baseline methods, proving
the effectiveness of our logic-driven constraints.

Conclusion: Qwen-Image在图像生成和编辑方面表现出强大的能力。

Abstract: We present Qwen-Image, an image generation foundation model in the Qwen
series that achieves significant advances in complex text rendering and precise
image editing. To address the challenges of complex text rendering, we design a
comprehensive data pipeline that includes large-scale data collection,
filtering, annotation, synthesis, and balancing. Moreover, we adopt a
progressive training strategy that starts with non-text-to-text rendering,
evolves from simple to complex textual inputs, and gradually scales up to
paragraph-level descriptions. This curriculum learning approach substantially
enhances the model's native text rendering capabilities. As a result,
Qwen-Image not only performs exceptionally well in alphabetic languages such as
English, but also achieves remarkable progress on more challenging logographic
languages like Chinese. To enhance image editing consistency, we introduce an
improved multi-task training paradigm that incorporates not only traditional
text-to-image (T2I) and text-image-to-image (TI2I) tasks but also
image-to-image (I2I) reconstruction, effectively aligning the latent
representations between Qwen2.5-VL and MMDiT. Furthermore, we separately feed
the original image into Qwen2.5-VL and the VAE encoder to obtain semantic and
reconstructive representations, respectively. This dual-encoding mechanism
enables the editing module to strike a balance between preserving semantic
consistency and maintaining visual fidelity. Qwen-Image achieves
state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating its strong capabilities in both
image generation and editing across multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: Despite the success of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP in aligning
vision and language, their proficiency in detailed, fine-grained visual
comprehension remains a key challenge. We present CLIP-IN, a novel framework
that bolsters CLIP's fine-grained perception through two core innovations.
Firstly, we leverage instruction-editing datasets, originally designed for
image manipulation, as a unique source of hard negative image-text pairs.
Coupled with a symmetric hard negative contrastive loss, this enables the model
to effectively distinguish subtle visual-semantic differences. Secondly,
CLIP-IN incorporates long descriptive captions, utilizing rotary positional
encodings to capture rich semantic context often missed by standard CLIP. Our
experiments demonstrate that CLIP-IN achieves substantial gains on the MMVP
benchmark and various fine-grained visual recognition tasks, without
compromising robust zero-shot performance on broader classification and
retrieval tasks. Critically, integrating CLIP-IN's visual representations into
Multimodal Large Language Models significantly reduces visual hallucinations
and enhances reasoning abilities. This work underscores the considerable
potential of synergizing targeted, instruction-based contrastive learning with
comprehensive descriptive information to elevate the fine-grained understanding
of VLMs.

Conclusion: LPD通过多样性空间和损失设计，显著提升了视频搜索的全面性和多样性。

Abstract: Ad-hoc Video Search (AVS) involves using a textual query to search for
multiple relevant videos in a large collection of unlabeled short videos. The
main challenge of AVS is the visual diversity of relevant videos. A simple
query such as "Find shots of a man and a woman dancing together indoors" can
span a multitude of environments, from brightly lit halls and shadowy bars to
dance scenes in black-and-white animations. It is therefore essential to
retrieve relevant videos as comprehensively as possible. Current solutions for
the AVS task primarily fuse multiple features into one or more common spaces,
yet overlook the need for diverse spaces. To fully exploit the expressive
capability of individual features, we propose LPD, short for Learning Partially
Decorrelated common spaces. LPD incorporates two key innovations:
feature-specific common space construction and the de-correlation loss.
Specifically, LPD learns a separate common space for each video and text
feature, and employs de-correlation loss to diversify the ordering of negative
samples across different spaces. To enhance the consistency of multi-space
convergence, we designed an entropy-based fair multi-space triplet ranking
loss. Extensive experiments on the TRECVID AVS benchmarks (2016-2023) justify
the effectiveness of LPD. Moreover, diversity visualizations of LPD's spaces
highlight its ability to enhance result diversity.

Result: Text2Lip在语义保真度、视觉真实性和模态鲁棒性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Text2Lip为可控且灵活的说话人脸生成提供了新范式。

Abstract: Generating semantically coherent and visually accurate talking faces requires
bridging the gap between linguistic meaning and facial articulation. Although
audio-driven methods remain prevalent, their reliance on high-quality paired
audio visual data and the inherent ambiguity in mapping acoustics to lip motion
pose significant challenges in terms of scalability and robustness. To address
these issues, we propose Text2Lip, a viseme-centric framework that constructs
an interpretable phonetic-visual bridge by embedding textual input into
structured viseme sequences. These mid-level units serve as a linguistically
grounded prior for lip motion prediction. Furthermore, we design a progressive
viseme-audio replacement strategy based on curriculum learning, enabling the
model to gradually transition from real audio to pseudo-audio reconstructed
from enhanced viseme features via cross-modal attention. This allows for robust
generation in both audio-present and audio-free scenarios. Finally, a
landmark-guided renderer synthesizes photorealistic facial videos with accurate
lip synchronization. Extensive evaluations show that Text2Lip outperforms
existing approaches in semantic fidelity, visual realism, and modality
robustness, establishing a new paradigm for controllable and flexible talking
face generation. Our project homepage is https://plyon1.github.io/Text2Lip/.

editable latent representations - is crucial for practical image editing
applications; however, achieving optimal balance between reconstruction
fidelity and editing flexibility remains a fundamental challenge. In this work,
we introduce the Optimal Transport Inversion Pipeline (OTIP), a zero-shot
framework that leverages optimal transport theory to guide the inversion
process in rectified flow models. Our underlying hypothesis is that
incorporating transport-based guidance during the reverse diffusion process can
effectively balance reconstruction accuracy and editing controllability through
principled trajectory optimization. The method computes optimal transport paths
between image and noise distributions while maintaining computational
efficiency. Our approach achieves high-fidelity reconstruction with LPIPS
scores of 0.001 and SSIM of 0.992 on face editing benchmarks, demonstrating
superior preservation of fine-grained details compared to existing methods. We
evaluate the framework across multiple editing tasks, observing 7.8% to 12.9%
improvements in reconstruction loss over RF-Inversion on the LSUN-Bedroom and
LSUN-Church datasets, respectively. For semantic face editing, our method
achieves an 11.2% improvement in identity preservation and a 1.6% enhancement
in perceptual quality, while maintaining computational efficiency comparable to
baseline approaches. Qualitatively, our method produces visually compelling
edits with superior semantic consistency and fine-grained detail preservation
across diverse editing scenarios. Code is available at:

TL;DR: 论文提出了TRUDI数据集和TITUS管道，用于识别港口物流中的运输单元（TUs），解决了公开数据集缺乏的问题，并在多样条件下验证了其可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 港口物流中运输单元的识别效率低，缺乏公开的多样化数据集阻碍了研究进展。

Method: 提出了TRUDI数据集（35,034个标注实例）和TITUS管道（三阶段：分割、ID定位、识别验证）。

Result: TITUS在不同视角、光照和天气条件下可靠识别TUs，优于依赖特定场景的系统。

Conclusion: TRUDI数据集和TITUS管道为港口物流数字化提供了基准，提升了整体效率。

Abstract: Identifying transportation units (TUs) is essential for improving the
efficiency of port logistics. However, progress in this field has been hindered
by the lack of publicly available benchmark datasets that capture the diversity
and dynamics of real-world port environments. To address this gap, we present
the TRUDI dataset-a comprehensive collection comprising 35,034 annotated
instances across five categories: container, tank container, trailer, ID text,
and logo. The images were captured at operational ports using both ground-based
and aerial cameras, under a wide variety of lighting and weather conditions.
For the identification of TUs-which involves reading the 11-digit alphanumeric
ID typically painted on each unit-we introduce TITUS, a dedicated pipeline that
operates in three stages: (1) segmenting the TU instances, (2) detecting the
location of the ID text, and (3) recognising and validating the extracted ID.
Unlike alternative systems, which often require similar scenes, specific camera
angles or gate setups, our evaluation demonstrates that TITUS reliably
identifies TUs from a range of camera perspectives and in varying lighting and
weather conditions. By making the TRUDI dataset publicly available, we provide
a robust benchmark that enables the development and comparison of new
approaches. This contribution supports digital transformation efforts in
multipurpose ports and helps to increase the efficiency of entire logistics
chains.

Conclusion: Uni-Layout通过统一生成与评估框架，提升了布局生成的质量和适用性。

Abstract: Layout generation plays a crucial role in enhancing both user experience and
design efficiency. However, current approaches suffer from task-specific
generation capabilities and perceptually misaligned evaluation metrics, leading
to limited applicability and ineffective measurement. In this paper, we propose
\textit{Uni-Layout}, a novel framework that achieves unified generation,
human-mimicking evaluation and alignment between the two. For universal
generation, we incorporate various layout tasks into a single taxonomy and
develop a unified generator that handles background or element contents
constrained tasks via natural language prompts. To introduce human feedback for
the effective evaluation of layouts, we build \textit{Layout-HF100k}, the first
large-scale human feedback dataset with 100,000 expertly annotated layouts.
Based on \textit{Layout-HF100k}, we introduce a human-mimicking evaluator that
integrates visual and geometric information, employing a Chain-of-Thought
mechanism to conduct qualitative assessments alongside a confidence estimation
module to yield quantitative measurements. For better alignment between the
generator and the evaluator, we integrate them into a cohesive system by
adopting Dynamic-Margin Preference Optimization (DMPO), which dynamically
adjusts margins based on preference strength to better align with human
judgments. Extensive experiments show that \textit{Uni-Layout} significantly
outperforms both task-specific and general-purpose methods. Our code is
publicly available at https://github.com/JD-GenX/Uni-Layout.

Conclusion: SMART-Ship数据集为多模态遥感任务提供了支持，并指出了未来研究方向。

Abstract: Given the limitations of satellite orbits and imaging conditions, multi-modal
remote sensing (RS) data is crucial in enabling long-term earth observation.
However, maritime surveillance remains challenging due to the complexity of
multi-scale targets and the dynamic environments. To bridge this critical gap,
we propose a Synchronized Multi-modal Aligned Remote sensing Targets dataset
for berthed ships analysis (SMART-Ship), containing spatiotemporal registered
images with fine-grained annotation for maritime targets from five modalities:
visible-light, synthetic aperture radar (SAR), panchromatic, multi-spectral,
and near-infrared. Specifically, our dataset consists of 1092 multi-modal image
sets, covering 38,838 ships. Each image set is acquired within one week and
registered to ensure spatiotemporal consistency. Ship instances in each set are
annotated with polygonal location information, fine-grained categories,
instance-level identifiers, and change region masks, organized hierarchically
to support diverse multi-modal RS tasks. Furthermore, we define standardized
benchmarks on five fundamental tasks and comprehensively compare representative
methods across the dataset. Thorough experiment evaluations validate that the
proposed SMART-Ship dataset could support various multi-modal RS interpretation
tasks and reveal the promising directions for further exploration.

Motivation: 推动无监督目标定位领域的发展，提出一种简单高效的方法。

Method: 使用CutOnce生成伪标签，结合自训练优化检测器性能。

Result: 在多个基准测试中优于现有方法，表现优异。

Conclusion: COLER是一种零样本无监督模型，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: We propose Cut-Once-and-LEaRn (COLER), a simple approach for unsupervised
instance segmentation and object detection. COLER first uses our developed
CutOnce to generate coarse pseudo labels, then enables the detector to learn
from these masks. CutOnce applies Normalized Cut only once and does not rely on
any clustering methods, but it can generate multiple object masks in an image.
We have designed several novel yet simple modules that not only allow CutOnce
to fully leverage the object discovery capabilities of self-supervised models,
but also free it from reliance on mask post-processing. During training, COLER
achieves strong performance without requiring specially designed loss functions
for pseudo labels, and its performance is further improved through
self-training. COLER is a zero-shot unsupervised model that outperforms
previous state-of-the-art methods on multiple benchmarks.We believe our method
can help advance the field of unsupervised object localization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LWD检测技术缺乏标准化方法，且对不同植物特性的适应性不足，导致在实际农业应用中的精度和鲁棒性不足。

Method: Hydra结合毫米波雷达和摄像头技术，使用CNN融合多张深度图像与RGB图像，并通过基于Transformer的编码器生成特征图，最终通过分类器检测叶片湿润状态。

Result: 在多种场景下，Hydra的分类准确率高达96%，在雨天、黎明或光线不足的夜晚等复杂环境中仍能保持约90%的准确率。

Conclusion: Hydra展示了在实际农业环境中高效检测LWD的潜力，为植物病害防治提供了可靠的技术支持。

Abstract: Leaf Wetness Duration (LWD), the time that water remains on leaf surfaces, is
crucial in the development of plant diseases. Existing LWD detection lacks
standardized measurement techniques, and variations across different plant
characteristics limit its effectiveness. Prior research proposes diverse
approaches, but they fail to measure real natural leaves directly and lack
resilience in various environmental conditions. This reduces the precision and
robustness, revealing a notable practical application and effectiveness gap in
real-world agricultural settings. This paper presents Hydra, an innovative
approach that integrates millimeter-wave (mm-Wave) radar with camera technology
to detect leaf wetness by determining if there is water on the leaf. We can
measure the time to determine the LWD based on this detection. Firstly, we
design a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to selectively fuse multiple
mm-Wave depth images with an RGB image to generate multiple feature images.
Then, we develop a transformer-based encoder to capture the inherent connection
among the multiple feature images to generate a feature map, which is further
fed to a classifier for detection. Moreover, we augment the dataset during
training to generalize our model. Implemented using a frequency-modulated
continuous-wave (FMCW) radar within the 76 to 81 GHz band, Hydra's performance
is meticulously evaluated on plants, demonstrating the potential to classify
leaf wetness with up to 96% accuracy across varying scenarios. Deploying Hydra
in the farm, including rainy, dawn, or poorly light nights, it still achieves
an accuracy rate of around 90%.

Conclusion: HGTS-Former在多元时间序列分析中表现出色，代码将开源。

Abstract: Multivariate time series analysis has long been one of the key research
topics in the field of artificial intelligence. However, analyzing complex time
series data remains a challenging and unresolved problem due to its high
dimensionality, dynamic nature, and complex interactions among variables.
Inspired by the strong structural modeling capability of hypergraphs, this
paper proposes a novel hypergraph-based time series transformer backbone
network, termed HGTS-Former, to address the multivariate coupling in time
series data. Specifically, given the multivariate time series signal, we first
normalize and embed each patch into tokens. Then, we adopt the multi-head
self-attention to enhance the temporal representation of each patch. The
hierarchical hypergraphs are constructed to aggregate the temporal patterns
within each channel and fine-grained relations between different variables.
After that, we convert the hyperedge into node features through the EdgeToNode
module and adopt the feed-forward network to further enhance the output
features. Extensive experiments conducted on two multivariate time series tasks
and eight datasets fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed
HGTS-Former. The source code will be released on

*Haohan Zheng,Zhenguo Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文揭示了大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）存在模态偏差问题，提出了一种无需训练的方法来缓解物体幻觉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs在理解和推理方面表现出色，但存在严重的物体幻觉问题。研究发现，这种幻觉不仅源于视觉与语言模型规模不匹配，还与模态偏差有关，即模型难以同时关注视觉和文本模态。

Method: 通过调整视觉和文本标记的注意力权重，平衡跨模态兼容性，并结合对比解码策略减少对参数知识的依赖。

Result: 实验证实模态偏差普遍存在，所提方法在多个开源LVLMs和基准测试中有效缓解了幻觉问题。

Conclusion: 该方法简单有效，具有广泛适用性，为缓解LVLMs的物体幻觉提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable multimodal
comprehension and reasoning capabilities, but they still suffer from severe
object hallucination. Previous studies primarily attribute the flaw to
linguistic prior caused by the scale mismatch between visual encoders and large
language models (LLMs) in LVLMs. Specifically, as current LVLMs are built upon
LLMs, they tend to over-rely on textual prompts and internal knowledge of LLMs,
generating descriptions inconsistent with visual cues. However, through an
in-depth investigation of the hallucinated mechanisms, we empirically reveal a
previously overlooked phenomenon: LVLMs may ignore not only visual information
but also textual modality during hallucination, a behavior termed as modality
bias, which indicates that LVLMs struggle to simultaneously attend to both
visual and textual modalities, leading to fragmented understanding of
user-provided instructions. Based on this observation, we propose a simple yet
effective training-free method to mitigate object hallucination. Concretely, we
intervene and adjust the attention weights of textual and visual tokens,
balancing cross-modal compatibility for better alignment with user intentions.
Furthermore, we adopt a contrastive decoding strategy to reduce the LVLM's
overreliance on its parametric knowledge, synergistically enhancing our
attention manipulation. Extensive experiments confirm the widespread presence
of modality bias in LVLMs. Notably, our method effectively mitigates
hallucination across multiple open-source LVLMs and benchmarks, highlighting
its generalizability and efficacy.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于Vision Transformers（ViTs）的新方法，利用MRI图像预测胶质母细胞瘤患者的总体生存期，无需肿瘤分割，简化了流程并降低了计算资源需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胶质母细胞瘤是一种高度侵袭性的脑肿瘤，生存期预测对个性化治疗和临床决策至关重要。传统方法依赖肿瘤分割，计算复杂。

Method: 采用Vision Transformers直接从MRI图像中提取特征，避免了肿瘤分割步骤，简化了工作流程。

Result: 在BRATS数据集上测试，准确率达到62.5%，在精确率、召回率和F1分数上表现均衡，优于其他方法。但数据集规模限制了ViT的泛化能力。

Conclusion: ViTs在医学影像任务中具有潜力，为高效且无需分割的生存期预测模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: Glioblastoma is one of the most aggressive and common brain tumors, with a
median survival of 10-15 months. Predicting Overall Survival (OS) is critical
for personalizing treatment strategies and aligning clinical decisions with
patient outcomes. In this study, we propose a novel Artificial Intelligence
(AI) approach for OS prediction using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) images,
exploiting Vision Transformers (ViTs) to extract hidden features directly from
MRI images, eliminating the need of tumor segmentation. Unlike traditional
approaches, our method simplifies the workflow and reduces computational
resource requirements.
  The proposed model was evaluated on the BRATS dataset, reaching an accuracy
of 62.5% on the test set, comparable to the top-performing methods.
Additionally, it demonstrated balanced performance across precision, recall,
and F1 score, overcoming the best model in these metrics. The dataset size
limits the generalization of the ViT which typically requires larger datasets
compared to convolutional neural networks. This limitation in generalization is
observed across all the cited studies. This work highlights the applicability
of ViTs for downsampled medical imaging tasks and establishes a foundation for
OS prediction models that are computationally efficient and do not rely on
segmentation.

Conclusion: InfoSyncNet通过创新的非均匀序列建模和数据增强，显著提升了视觉语音识别的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Estimating spoken content from silent videos is crucial for applications in
Assistive Technology (AT) and Augmented Reality (AR). However, accurately
mapping lip movement sequences in videos to words poses significant challenges
due to variability across sequences and the uneven distribution of information
within each sequence. To tackle this, we introduce InfoSyncNet, a non-uniform
sequence modeling network enhanced by tailored data augmentation techniques.
Central to InfoSyncNet is a non-uniform quantization module positioned between
the encoder and decoder, enabling dynamic adjustment to the network's focus and
effectively handling the natural inconsistencies in visual speech data.
Additionally, multiple training strategies are incorporated to enhance the
model's capability to handle variations in lighting and the speaker's
orientation. Comprehensive experiments on the LRW and LRW1000 datasets confirm
the superiority of InfoSyncNet, achieving new state-of-the-art accuracies of
92.0% and 60.7% Top-1 ACC. The code is available for download (see comments).

TL;DR: SAMPO框架通过偏好优化，使视觉基础模型能够从稀疏视觉交互中推断高级类别意图，显著提升密集同质对象的分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基础模型（如SAM）仅能分割明确提示的对象，无法泛化到用户隐含需求的语义相关实例，尤其在密集同质对象（如生物医学核分割）领域表现不佳。

Method: 提出SAMPO框架，通过偏好优化使模型隐式捕获目标类别特征，无需依赖语言模型，实现稀疏提示下的鲁棒多对象分割。

Result: 在三个医学分割任务中，SAMPO表现最佳，例如PanNuke-T2任务中，仅用10%训练数据即超越所有基线方法，性能提升超过9个百分点。

Conclusion: SAMPO为视觉基础模型建立了意图感知对齐的新范式，无需辅助提示生成器或语言模型辅助的偏好学习。

Abstract: Foundation models like Segment Anything Model (SAM) excel in promptable
segmentation but suffer from an intent gap: they segment only explicitly
prompted objects, failing to generalize to semantically related instances
implicitly desired by users. This limitation is critical in domains with dense
homogeneous objects (e.g., biomedical nuclei segmentation), where sparse visual
prompts typically yield incomplete results, rendering dense annotations
impractical due to prohibitive cost. To bridge this gap, we introduce SAMPO
(Segment Anything Model with Preference Optimization), a novel framework that
teaches visual foundation models to infer high-level categorical intent from
sparse visual interactions. Unlike conventional pixel-level fine-tuning, SAMPO
optimizes models to implicitly capture target-class characteristics through
preference optimization. This approach, which operates without dependency on
language models, enables robust multi-object segmentation even under sparse
prompting and demonstrates superior data efficiency during fine-tuning.
Validated on three medical segmentation tasks, SAMPO achieves state-of-the-art
performance: on challenging tasks like PanNuke-T2, our method, when fine-tuned
with only 10% of the training data, significantly outperforms all existing
methods trained on the full 100% dataset, achieving an improvement of over 9
percentage points compared to the best baseline. Our work establishes a new
paradigm for intent-aware alignment in visual foundation models, removing
dependencies on auxiliary prompt generators or language-model-assisted
preference learning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多类异常检测模型在单模型处理多类时性能较差，且类别信息的使用方式对检测阈值定义影响较大，但研究较少。

Method: 提出Hierarchical Coreset (HierCore)框架，利用分层记忆库估计类别的异常检测标准，无需类别标签即可运行。

Result: 实验表明HierCore在所有四种场景下均满足需求，性能稳定且优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HierCore在多类异常检测任务中具有实际应用潜力，能适应不同类别标签可用性的场景。

Abstract: Recent advances in image anomaly detection have extended unsupervised
learning-based models from single-class settings to multi-class frameworks,
aiming to improve efficiency in training time and model storage. When a single
model is trained to handle multiple classes, it often underperforms compared to
class-specific models in terms of per-class detection accuracy. Accordingly,
previous studies have primarily focused on narrowing this performance gap.
However, the way class information is used, or not used, remains a relatively
understudied factor that could influence how detection thresholds are defined
in multi-class image anomaly detection. These thresholds, whether
class-specific or class-agnostic, significantly affect detection outcomes. In
this study, we identify and formalize the requirements that a multi-class image
anomaly detection model must satisfy under different conditions, depending on
whether class labels are available during training and evaluation. We then
re-examine existing methods under these criteria. To meet these challenges, we
propose Hierarchical Coreset (HierCore), a novel framework designed to satisfy
all defined requirements. HierCore operates effectively even without class
labels, leveraging a hierarchical memory bank to estimate class-wise decision
criteria for anomaly detection. We empirically validate the applicability and
robustness of existing methods and HierCore under four distinct scenarios,
determined by the presence or absence of class labels in the training and
evaluation phases. The experimental results demonstrate that HierCore
consistently meets all requirements and maintains strong, stable performance
across all settings, highlighting its practical potential for real-world
multi-class anomaly detection tasks.

Conclusion: FMS通过多监督机制有效提升了多模态媒体篡改检测的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: The task of Detecting and Grounding Multi-Modal Media Manipulation (DGM$^4$)
is a branch of misinformation detection. Unlike traditional binary
classification, it includes complex subtasks such as forgery content
localization and forgery method classification. Consider that existing methods
are often limited in performance due to neglecting the erroneous interference
caused by unreliable unimodal data and failing to establish comprehensive
forgery supervision for mining fine-grained tampering traces. In this paper, we
present a Fine-grained Multiple Supervisory (FMS) network, which incorporates
modality reliability supervision, unimodal internal supervision and cross-modal
supervision to provide comprehensive guidance for DGM$^4$ detection. For
modality reliability supervision, we propose the Multimodal Decision Supervised
Correction (MDSC) module. It leverages unimodal weak supervision to correct the
multi-modal decision-making process. For unimodal internal supervision, we
propose the Unimodal Forgery Mining Reinforcement (UFMR) module. It amplifies
the disparity between real and fake information within unimodal modality from
both feature-level and sample-level perspectives. For cross-modal supervision,
we propose the Multimodal Forgery Alignment Reasoning (MFAR) module. It
utilizes soft-attention interactions to achieve cross-modal feature perception
from both consistency and inconsistency perspectives, where we also design the
interaction constraints to ensure the interaction quality. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our FMS compared to
state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic videos from fMRI is important for understanding visual
cognition and enabling vivid brain-computer interfaces. However, current
methods are critically limited to single-shot clips, failing to address the
multi-shot nature of real-world experiences. Multi-shot reconstruction faces
fundamental challenges: fMRI signal mixing across shots, the temporal
resolution mismatch between fMRI and video obscuring rapid scene changes, and
the lack of dedicated multi-shot fMRI-video datasets. To overcome these
limitations, we propose a novel divide-and-decode framework for multi-shot fMRI
video reconstruction. Our core innovations are: (1) A shot boundary predictor
module explicitly decomposing mixed fMRI signals into shot-specific segments.
(2) Generative keyframe captioning using LLMs, which decodes robust textual
descriptions from each segment, overcoming temporal blur by leveraging
high-level semantics. (3) Novel large-scale data synthesis (20k samples) from
existing datasets. Experimental results demonstrate our framework outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in multi-shot reconstruction fidelity. Ablation
studies confirm the critical role of fMRI decomposition and semantic
captioning, with decomposition significantly improving decoded caption CLIP
similarity by 71.8%. This work establishes a new paradigm for multi-shot fMRI
reconstruction, enabling accurate recovery of complex visual narratives through
explicit decomposition and semantic prompting.

Motivation: 3D高斯溅射（3DGS）在低质量初始化时会产生浮动伪影，影响视觉质量，但其成因尚未充分研究。

Method: 通过频率域分析识别未优化高斯为伪影主因，提出EFA-GS方法，选择性扩展未优化高斯以优先学习低频信息，并结合深度和尺度策略动态优化扩展。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a powerful and computationally efficient
representation for 3D reconstruction. Despite its strengths, 3DGS often
produces floating artifacts, which are erroneous structures detached from the
actual geometry and significantly degrade visual fidelity. The underlying
mechanisms causing these artifacts, particularly in low-quality initialization
scenarios, have not been fully explored. In this paper, we investigate the
origins of floating artifacts from a frequency-domain perspective and identify
under-optimized Gaussians as the primary source. Based on our analysis, we
propose \textit{Eliminating-Floating-Artifacts} Gaussian Splatting (EFA-GS),
which selectively expands under-optimized Gaussians to prioritize accurate
low-frequency learning. Additionally, we introduce complementary depth-based
and scale-based strategies to dynamically refine Gaussian expansion,
effectively mitigating detail erosion. Extensive experiments on both synthetic
and real-world datasets demonstrate that EFA-GS substantially reduces floating
artifacts while preserving high-frequency details, achieving an improvement of
1.68 dB in PSNR over baseline method on our RWLQ dataset. Furthermore, we
validate the effectiveness of our approach in downstream 3D editing tasks. Our
implementation will be released on GitHub.

TL;DR: 提出ReMake框架，通过实例掩码和单目深度估计改进透明物体的深度补全，提升机器人抓取的准确性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 透明物体导致深度相机生成不完整或无效的深度数据，现有方法泛化能力不足。

Method: 结合实例掩码和单目深度估计，明确区分透明区域，专注于学习透明区域的深度估计。

Result: 在基准数据集和实际场景中表现优于现有方法，准确性和泛化能力更强。

Conclusion: ReMake通过显式区分透明区域和提供深度上下文，显著提升了深度补全的效果。

Abstract: Due to the optical properties, transparent objects often lead depth cameras
to generate incomplete or invalid depth data, which in turn reduces the
accuracy and reliability of robotic grasping. Existing approaches typically
input the RGB-D image directly into the network to output the complete depth,
expecting the model to implicitly infer the reliability of depth values.
However, while effective in training datasets, such methods often fail to
generalize to real-world scenarios, where complex light interactions lead to
highly variable distributions of valid and invalid depth data. To address this,
we propose ReMake, a novel depth completion framework guided by an instance
mask and monocular depth estimation. By explicitly distinguishing transparent
regions from non-transparent ones, the mask enables the model to concentrate on
learning accurate depth estimation in these areas from RGB-D input during
training. This targeted supervision reduces reliance on implicit reasoning and
improves generalization to real-world scenarios. Additionally, monocular depth
estimation provides depth context between the transparent object and its
surroundings, enhancing depth prediction accuracy. Extensive experiments show
that our method outperforms existing approaches on both benchmark datasets and
real-world scenarios, demonstrating superior accuracy and generalization
capability. Code and videos are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 短视频平台上用户生成内容（UGC）的快速增长使得预测视频参与度对优化推荐系统和内容创作至关重要，但现有方法难以有效建模多模态特征的交互。

Method: 采用两种LMMs（VideoLLaMA2和Qwen2.5-VL），分别整合不同模态特征（音频、视觉、语言或仅视觉、语言），并在SnapUGC数据集上训练。

Result: 两种模型均表现优异，VideoLLaMA2因结合音频特征表现更优，集成方法在ICCV VQualA 2025比赛中获得第一名。

Conclusion: 大型多模态模型在视频参与度预测中表现优异，音频特征是关键因素，集成方法可进一步提升性能。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of user-generated content (UGC) on short-form video
platforms has made video engagement prediction increasingly important for
optimizing recommendation systems and guiding content creation. However, this
task remains challenging due to the complex interplay of factors such as
semantic content, visual quality, audio characteristics, and user background.
Prior studies have leveraged various types of features from different
modalities, such as visual quality, semantic content, background sound, etc.,
but often struggle to effectively model their cross-feature and cross-modality
interactions. In this work, we empirically investigate the potential of large
multimodal models (LMMs) for video engagement prediction. We adopt two
representative LMMs: VideoLLaMA2, which integrates audio, visual, and language
modalities, and Qwen2.5-VL, which models only visual and language modalities.
Specifically, VideoLLaMA2 jointly processes key video frames, text-based
metadata, and background sound, while Qwen2.5-VL utilizes only key video frames
and text-based metadata. Trained on the SnapUGC dataset, both models
demonstrate competitive performance against state-of-the-art baselines,
showcasing the effectiveness of LMMs in engagement prediction. Notably,
VideoLLaMA2 consistently outperforms Qwen2.5-VL, highlighting the importance of
audio features in engagement prediction. By ensembling two types of models, our
method achieves first place in the ICCV VQualA 2025 EVQA-SnapUGC Challenge on
short-form video engagement prediction. The code is available at

TL;DR: 研究探讨了艺术斑马线对视觉行人检测模型的影响，发现复杂图案会降低检测性能，且可能被恶意利用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 艺术斑马线虽提升行人安全，但其视觉复杂性可能干扰依赖视觉的监控系统。

Method: 通过合成不同艺术图案到固定监控场景，评估模型在正常和恶意条件下的行人检测表现。

Result: 复杂艺术图案显著降低检测性能，恶意设计的图案可隐藏真实行人或生成虚假检测。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了城市视觉监控系统的潜在漏洞，强调设计鲁棒模型时需考虑环境视觉变化。

Abstract: Artistic crosswalks featuring asphalt art, introduced by different
organizations in recent years, aim to enhance the visibility and safety of
pedestrians. However, their visual complexity may interfere with surveillance
systems that rely on vision-based object detection models. In this study, we
investigate the impact of asphalt art on pedestrian detection performance of a
pretrained vision-based object detection model. We construct realistic
crosswalk scenarios by compositing various street art patterns into a fixed
surveillance scene and evaluate the model's performance in detecting
pedestrians on asphalt-arted crosswalks under both benign and adversarial
conditions. A benign case refers to pedestrian crosswalks painted with existing
normal asphalt art, whereas an adversarial case involves digitally crafted or
altered asphalt art perpetrated by an attacker. Our results show that while
simple, color-based designs have minimal effect, complex artistic patterns,
particularly those with high visual salience, can significantly degrade
pedestrian detection performance. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
adversarially crafted asphalt art can be exploited to deliberately obscure real
pedestrians or generate non-existent pedestrian detections. These findings
highlight a potential vulnerability in urban vision-based pedestrian
surveillance systems and underscore the importance of accounting for
environmental visual variations when designing robust pedestrian perception
models.

TL;DR: PAVC框架动态调整视频压缩级别以适应天气和光照条件，提升车辆检测精度并减少带宽需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决智能交通系统中因带宽限制导致的实时性能问题，同时减少视频质量损失对车辆检测精度的影响。

Method: 采用Precision-Aware Video Compression (PAVC)框架，动态调整压缩级别以适应环境变化。

Result: PAVC提升车辆检测精度13%，在中等带宽下减少8.23倍带宽需求，在极低带宽下减少72倍需求。

Conclusion: PAVC有效平衡了带宽需求和车辆检测精度，适用于不同带宽条件的智能交通系统。

Abstract: Computer vision has become a popular tool in intelligent transportation
systems (ITS), enabling various applications through roadside traffic cameras
that capture video and transmit it in real time to computing devices within the
same network. The efficiency of this video transmission largely depends on the
available bandwidth of the communication system. However, limited bandwidth can
lead to communication bottlenecks, hindering the real-time performance of ITS
applications. To mitigate this issue, lossy video compression techniques can be
used to reduce bandwidth requirements, at the cost of degrading video quality.
This degradation can negatively impact the accuracy of applications that rely
on real-time vehicle detection. Additionally, vehicle detection accuracy is
influenced by environmental factors such as weather and lighting conditions,
suggesting that compression levels should be dynamically adjusted in response
to these variations. In this work, we utilize a framework called
Precision-Aware Video Compression (PAVC), where a roadside video camera
captures footage of vehicles on roadways, compresses videos, and then transmits
them to a processing unit, running a vehicle detection algorithm for
safety-critical applications, such as real-time collision risk assessment. The
system dynamically adjusts the video compression level based on current weather
and lighting conditions to maintain vehicle detection accuracy while minimizing
bandwidth usage. Our results demonstrate that PAVC improves vehicle detection
accuracy by up to 13% and reduces communication bandwidth requirements by up to
8.23x in areas with moderate bandwidth availability. Moreover, in locations
with severely limited bandwidth, PAVC reduces bandwidth requirements by up to
72x while preserving vehicle detection performance.

Motivation: 当前文本到运动生成方法面临多样性和物理合理性不足的挑战，ReMoMask旨在通过创新技术解决这些问题。

Method: ReMoMask结合了双向动量文本-运动模型、语义时空注意力机制和RAG-无分类器引导，提升了跨模态检索精度和运动生成的物理合理性。

Conclusion: ReMoMask通过创新设计显著提升了文本到运动生成的性能，成为当前最先进的方法。

Abstract: Text-to-Motion (T2M) generation aims to synthesize realistic and semantically
aligned human motion sequences from natural language descriptions. However,
current approaches face dual challenges: Generative models (e.g., diffusion
models) suffer from limited diversity, error accumulation, and physical
implausibility, while Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods exhibit
diffusion inertia, partial-mode collapse, and asynchronous artifacts. To
address these limitations, we propose ReMoMask, a unified framework integrating
three key innovations: 1) A Bidirectional Momentum Text-Motion Model decouples
negative sample scale from batch size via momentum queues, substantially
improving cross-modal retrieval precision; 2) A Semantic Spatio-temporal
Attention mechanism enforces biomechanical constraints during part-level fusion
to eliminate asynchronous artifacts; 3) RAG-Classier-Free Guidance incorporates
minor unconditional generation to enhance generalization. Built upon MoMask's
RVQ-VAE, ReMoMask efficiently generates temporally coherent motions in minimal
steps. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate the
state-of-the-art performance of ReMoMask, achieving a 3.88% and 10.97%
improvement in FID scores on HumanML3D and KIT-ML, respectively, compared to
the previous SOTA method RAG-T2M. Code:

Motivation: 当前MLLMs在VQA基准测试中的评估依赖点估计，忽视了性能方差的影响，如随机模型输出、训练种子敏感性和超参数配置。

Method: 通过分析14个VQA基准测试中的方差，研究训练种子、框架非确定性、模型规模和指令微调对性能的影响，并探索Cloze式评估策略。

Result: 研究发现当前评估方法存在局限性，方差显著影响性能，Cloze式评估能减少随机性并提高可靠性。

Conclusion: 建议采用方差感知方法以促进MLLMs的更稳健发展。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for
visual question answering (VQA), enabling reasoning and contextual
understanding across visual and textual modalities. Despite their advancements,
the evaluation of MLLMs on VQA benchmarks often relies on point estimates,
overlooking the significant variance in performance caused by factors such as
stochastic model outputs, training seed sensitivity, and hyperparameter
configurations. This paper critically examines these issues by analyzing
variance across 14 widely used VQA benchmarks, covering diverse tasks such as
visual reasoning, text understanding, and commonsense reasoning. We
systematically study the impact of training seed, framework non-determinism,
model scale, and extended instruction finetuning on performance variability.
Additionally, we explore Cloze-style evaluation as an alternate assessment
strategy, studying its effectiveness in reducing stochasticity and improving
reliability across benchmarks. Our findings highlight the limitations of
current evaluation practices and advocate for variance-aware methodologies to
foster more robust and reliable development of MLLMs.

TL;DR: PMGS提出了一种基于3D高斯抛射的投影运动重建方法，通过目标建模和运动恢复两阶段流程，结合物理一致性约束和动态模拟退火策略，显著提升了高速非线性刚体运动的重建性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有动态重建方法主要局限于短时、小尺度变形，且对物理一致性的考虑不足，无法有效建模大时空跨度的复杂刚体运动。

Method: PMGS采用两阶段流程：1) 目标建模，通过动态场景分解和改进的点密度控制实现对象中心化重建；2) 运动恢复，通过逐帧SE(3)位姿学习恢复完整运动序列。引入加速度一致性约束和动态模拟退火策略，并结合卡尔曼融合优化多源观测误差。

Result: 实验表明，PMGS在高速非线性刚体运动重建中优于主流动态方法。

Conclusion: PMGS通过结合物理约束和自适应学习策略，成功解决了大时空跨度复杂刚体运动的重建难题。

Abstract: Modeling complex rigid motion across large spatiotemporal spans remains an
unresolved challenge in dynamic reconstruction. Existing paradigms are mainly
confined to short-term, small-scale deformation and offer limited consideration
for physical consistency. This study proposes PMGS, focusing on reconstructing
Projectile Motion via 3D Gaussian Splatting. The workflow comprises two stages:
1) Target Modeling: achieving object-centralized reconstruction through dynamic
scene decomposition and an improved point density control; 2) Motion Recovery:
restoring full motion sequences by learning per-frame SE(3) poses. We introduce
an acceleration consistency constraint to bridge Newtonian mechanics and pose
estimation, and design a dynamic simulated annealing strategy that adaptively
schedules learning rates based on motion states. Futhermore, we devise a Kalman
fusion scheme to optimize error accumulation from multi-source observations to
mitigate disturbances. Experiments show PMGS's superior performance in
reconstructing high-speed nonlinear rigid motion compared to mainstream dynamic
methods.

TL;DR: MedVLThinker提供了一套开放且可复现的医疗大型推理模型（LMMs）构建方法，包括数据整理和两种训练范式（SFT和RLVR），其中RLVR表现更优，且仅使用文本数据训练效果更佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏开放、可复现的医疗推理模型构建方法，阻碍了社区研究和比较。

Method: 1. 系统整理文本和图像-文本医疗数据；2. 采用SFT和RLVR两种训练范式。

Result: RLVR显著优于SFT，且仅用文本数据训练效果更佳；7B模型在公开VQA基准上达到新SOTA。

Conclusion: MedVLThinker为医疗多模态推理研究提供了开放基础，性能媲美GPT-4o。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have introduced a new paradigm in AI by
enabling models to ``think before responding" via chain-of-thought reasoning.
However, the absence of open and reproducible recipes for building
reasoning-centric medical LMMs hinders community-wide research, analysis, and
comparison. In this paper, we present MedVLThinker, a suite of simple yet
strong baselines. Our fully open recipe consists of: (1) systematic data
curation for both text-only and image-text medical data, filtered according to
varying levels of reasoning difficulty, and (2) two training paradigms:
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on distilled reasoning traces and Reinforcement
Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) based on final answer correctness.
Across extensive experiments on the Qwen2.5-VL model family (3B, 7B) and six
medical QA benchmarks, we find that RLVR consistently and significantly
outperforms SFT. Additionally, under the RLVR framework, a key,
counter-intuitive finding is that training on our curated text-only reasoning
data provides a more substantial performance boost than training on multimodal
image-text data. Our best open 7B model, trained using the RLVR recipe on
text-only data, establishes a new state-of-the-art on existing public VQA
benchmarks, surpassing all previous open-source medical LMMs. Furthermore,
scaling our model to 32B achieves performance on par with the proprietary
GPT-4o. We release all curated data, models, and code to provide the community
with a strong, open foundation for future research in multimodal medical
reasoning.

Conclusion: AugPT为提示调优提供了一种高效且自包含的解决方案。

Abstract: For CLIP-based prompt tuning, introducing more data as additional knowledge
for enhancing fine-tuning process is proved to be an effective approach.
Existing data amplification strategies for prompt tuning typically rely on
external knowledge (e.g., large language models or pre-structured knowledge
bases), resulting in higher costs for data collection and processing, while
generally ignoring further utilization of features in image modality. To
address this, we propose Augmentation-driven Prompt Tuning (AugPT), a
self-contained distillation-based prompt tuning approach using only internal
augmentation on raw dataset to better exploit known features. Specifically,
AugPT employs self-supervised augmentation on unlabeled images in the training
set, and introduces a novel gating mechanism based on consensus test, reusing
the pre-trained prompt tuning backbone model to spontaneously filter noisy
samples, further enhancing the quality of augmented views. Extensive
experiments validate that AugPT simultaneously enhances model performance and
generalization capability without using appended external knowledge. The code
of AugPT is available at: https://github.com/JREion/AugPT .

Result: 研究发现不同因素类别之间存在显著差异，深度和边缘方向对可读性有重要影响。

Conclusion: 3D图形绘制中的边缘配置因素需要被纳入质量评估，以优化可视化效果。

Abstract: Human perception of graph drawings is influenced by a variety of impact
factors for which quality measures are used as a proxy indicator. The
investigation of those impact factors and their effects is important to
evaluate and improve quality measures and drawing algorithms. The number of
edge crossings in a 2D graph drawing has long been a main quality measure for
drawing evaluation. The use of stereoscopic 3D graph visualisations has gained
attraction over the last years, and results from several studies indicate that
they can improve analysis efficiency for a range of analysis scenarios. While
edge crossings can also occur in 3D, there are edge configurations in space
that are not crossings but might be perceived as such from a specific
viewpoint. Such configurations create crossings when projected on the
corresponding 2D image plane and could impact readability similar to 2D
crossings. In 3D drawings, the additional depth aspect and the subsequent
impact factors of edge distance and relative edge direction in space might
further influence the importance of those configurations for readability. We
investigate the impact of such factors in an empirical study and report on
findings of difference between major factor categories.

Abstract: We present MeshLLM, a novel framework that leverages large language models
(LLMs) to understand and generate text-serialized 3D meshes. Our approach
addresses key limitations in existing methods, including the limited dataset
scale when catering to LLMs' token length and the loss of 3D structural
information during mesh serialization. We introduce a Primitive-Mesh
decomposition strategy, which divides 3D meshes into structurally meaningful
subunits. This enables the creation of a large-scale dataset with 1500k+
samples, almost 50 times larger than previous methods, which aligns better with
the LLM scaling law principles. Furthermore, we propose inferring face
connectivity from vertices and local mesh assembly training strategies,
significantly enhancing the LLMs' ability to capture mesh topology and spatial
structures. Experiments show that MeshLLM outperforms the state-of-the-art
LLaMA-Mesh in both mesh generation quality and shape understanding,
highlighting its great potential in processing text-serialized 3D meshes.

Conclusion: ReMu为单目相机下的多层3D服装重建提供了高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: The reconstruction of multi-layer 3D garments typically requires expensive
multi-view capture setups and specialized 3D editing efforts. To support the
creation of life-like clothed human avatars, we introduce ReMu for
reconstructing multi-layer clothed humans in a new setup, Image Layers, which
captures a subject wearing different layers of clothing with a single RGB
camera. To reconstruct physically plausible multi-layer 3D garments, a unified
3D representation is necessary to model these garments in a layered manner.
Thus, we first reconstruct and align each garment layer in a shared coordinate
system defined by the canonical body pose. Afterwards, we introduce a
collision-aware optimization process to address interpenetration and further
refine the garment boundaries leveraging implicit neural fields. It is worth
noting that our method is template-free and category-agnostic, which enables
the reconstruction of 3D garments in diverse clothing styles. Through our
experiments, we show that our method reconstructs nearly penetration-free 3D
clothed humans and achieves competitive performance compared to
category-specific methods. Project page: https://eth-ait.github.io/ReMu/

Abstract: In-betweening human motion generation aims to synthesize intermediate motions
that transition between user-specified keyframes. In addition to maintaining
smooth transitions, a crucial requirement of this task is to generate diverse
motion sequences. It is still challenging to maintain diversity, particularly
when it is necessary for the motions within a generated batch sampling to
differ meaningfully from one another due to complex motion dynamics. In this
paper, we propose a novel method, termed the Multi-Criteria Guidance with
In-Betweening Motion Model (MCG-IMM), for in-betweening human motion
generation. A key strength of MCG-IMM lies in its plug-and-play nature: it
enhances the diversity of motions generated by pretrained models without
introducing additional parameters This is achieved by providing a sampling
process of pretrained generative models with multi-criteria guidance.
Specifically, MCG-IMM reformulates the sampling process of pretrained
generative model as a multi-criteria optimization problem, and introduces an
optimization process to explore motion sequences that satisfy multiple
criteria, e.g., diversity and smoothness. Moreover, our proposed plug-and-play
multi-criteria guidance is compatible with different families of generative
models, including denoised diffusion probabilistic models, variational
autoencoders, and generative adversarial networks. Experiments on four popular
human motion datasets demonstrate that MCG-IMM consistently state-of-the-art
methods in in-betweening motion generation task.

Abstract: In this work, we present a novel method for uncertainty estimation (UE) in
Gaussian Splatting. UE is crucial for using Gaussian Splatting in critical
applications such as robotics and medicine. Previous methods typically estimate
the variance of Gaussian primitives and use the rendering process to obtain
pixel-wise uncertainties. Our method establishes primitive representations of
error and visibility of trainings views, which carries meaningful uncertainty
information. This representation is obtained by projection of training error
and visibility onto the primitives. Uncertainties of novel views are obtained
by rendering the primitive representations of uncertainty for those novel
views, yielding uncertainty feature maps. To aggregate these uncertainty
feature maps of novel views, we perform a pixel-wise regression on holdout
data. In our experiments, we analyze the different components of our method,
investigating various combinations of uncertainty feature maps and regression
models. Furthermore, we considered the effect of separating splatting into
foreground and background. Our UEs show high correlations to true errors,
outperforming state-of-the-art methods, especially on foreground objects. The
trained regression models show generalization capabilities to new scenes,
allowing uncertainty estimation without the need for holdout data.

### [233] [ReCoSeg++:Extended Residual-Guided Cross-Modal Diffusion for Brain Tumor Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01058)
*Sara Yavari,Rahul Nitin Pandya,Jacob Furst*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种半监督的两阶段框架，用于MRI脑肿瘤分割，通过扩散模型和轻量级U-Net结合，显著提升了分割精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRI脑肿瘤分割对临床诊断和治疗规划至关重要，但现有方法在大型异构数据集上表现不足。

Method: 第一阶段使用DDPM模型进行跨模态合成，生成残差图作为空间先验；第二阶段用轻量级U-Net结合残差图和多模态数据进行分割。

Result: 在BraTS 2021数据集上，Dice分数为93.02%，IoU为86.7%，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在精度和扩展性上表现优异，适用于真实世界的多中心MRI数据集。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of brain tumors in MRI scans is critical for clinical
diagnosis and treatment planning. We propose a semi-supervised, two-stage
framework that extends the ReCoSeg approach to the larger and more
heterogeneous BraTS 2021 dataset, while eliminating the need for ground-truth
masks for the segmentation objective. In the first stage, a residual-guided
denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) performs cross-modal synthesis
by reconstructing the T1ce modality from FLAIR, T1, and T2 scans. The residual
maps, capturing differences between predicted and actual T1ce images, serve as
spatial priors to enhance downstream segmentation. In the second stage, a
lightweight U-Net takes as input the concatenation of residual maps, computed
as the difference between real T1ce and synthesized T1ce, with T1, T2, and
FLAIR modalities to improve whole tumor segmentation. To address the increased
scale and variability of BraTS 2021, we apply slice-level filtering to exclude
non-informative samples and optimize thresholding strategies to balance
precision and recall. Our method achieves a Dice score of $93.02\%$ and an IoU
of $86.7\%$ for whole tumor segmentation on the BraTS 2021 dataset,
outperforming the ReCoSeg baseline on BraTS 2020 (Dice: $91.7\%$, IoU:
$85.3\%$), and demonstrating improved accuracy and scalability for real-world,
multi-center MRI datasets.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种专为医学图像分割设计的轻量级模型Mobile U-ViT，结合了CNN和Transformer的优势，在资源受限的设备上高效运行。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有移动模型在医学图像任务上表现不佳的问题，因医学图像与自然图像的信息密度差异大。

Method: 采用ConvUtr作为分层补丁嵌入，引入LGL块平衡局部-全局信息交换，并使用轻量级Transformer瓶颈和级联解码器。

Result: 在八个公开的2D和3D数据集上达到最先进性能，包括在四个未见数据集上的零样本测试。

Conclusion: Mobile U-ViT是一种高效、强大且通用的移动医学图像分析解决方案。

Abstract: In clinical practice, medical image analysis often requires efficient
execution on resource-constrained mobile devices. However, existing mobile
models-primarily optimized for natural images-tend to perform poorly on medical
tasks due to the significant information density gap between natural and
medical domains. Combining computational efficiency with medical
imaging-specific architectural advantages remains a challenge when developing
lightweight, universal, and high-performing networks. To address this, we
propose a mobile model called Mobile U-shaped Vision Transformer (Mobile U-ViT)
tailored for medical image segmentation. Specifically, we employ the newly
purposed ConvUtr as a hierarchical patch embedding, featuring a
parameter-efficient large-kernel CNN with inverted bottleneck fusion. This
design exhibits transformer-like representation learning capacity while being
lighter and faster. To enable efficient local-global information exchange, we
introduce a novel Large-kernel Local-Global-Local (LGL) block that effectively
balances the low information density and high-level semantic discrepancy of
medical images. Finally, we incorporate a shallow and lightweight transformer
bottleneck for long-range modeling and employ a cascaded decoder with
downsample skip connections for dense prediction. Despite its reduced
computational demands, our medical-optimized architecture achieves
state-of-the-art performance across eight public 2D and 3D datasets covering
diverse imaging modalities, including zero-shot testing on four unseen
datasets. These results establish it as an efficient yet powerful and
generalization solution for mobile medical image analysis. Code is available at

### [235] [Sparse 3D Perception for Rose Harvesting Robots: A Two-Stage Approach Bridging Simulation and Real-World Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00900)
*Taha Samavati,Mohsen Soryani,Sina Mansouri*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出一种用于花朵采摘机器人的3D感知管道，通过两阶段算法和合成数据集解决数据稀缺问题，性能优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球对药用植物（如大马士革玫瑰）需求增长，但人工采摘效率低，需自动化解决方案。

Method: 两阶段算法：先进行2D点检测，再用轻量级深度神经网络估计深度；使用Blender生成合成数据集。

Result: F1分数95.6%（合成）和74.4%（真实），深度误差3%（2米范围）。

Conclusion: 该方法为农业自动化提供可扩展解决方案，缩小合成与真实数据差距。

Abstract: The global demand for medicinal plants, such as Damask roses, has surged with
population growth, yet labor-intensive harvesting remains a bottleneck for
scalability. To address this, we propose a novel 3D perception pipeline
tailored for flower-harvesting robots, focusing on sparse 3D localization of
rose centers. Our two-stage algorithm first performs 2D point-based detection
on stereo images, followed by depth estimation using a lightweight deep neural
network. To overcome the challenge of scarce real-world labeled data, we
introduce a photorealistic synthetic dataset generated via Blender, simulating
a dynamic rose farm environment with precise 3D annotations. This approach
minimizes manual labeling costs while enabling robust model training. We
evaluate two depth estimation paradigms: a traditional triangulation-based
method and our proposed deep learning framework. Results demonstrate the
superiority of our method, achieving an F1 score of 95.6% (synthetic) and 74.4%
(real) in 2D detection, with a depth estimation error of 3% at a 2-meter range
on synthetic data. The pipeline is optimized for computational efficiency,
ensuring compatibility with resource-constrained robotic systems. By bridging
the domain gap between synthetic and real-world data, this work advances
agricultural automation for specialty crops, offering a scalable solution for
precision harvesting.

*Jiayuan Wang,Farhad Pourpanah,Q. M. Jonathan Wu,Ning Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文综述了多任务学习（MTL）在联网自动驾驶车辆（CAV）中的应用，探讨了其在感知、预测、规划等模块的优势与挑战，并提出了未来研究方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CAV任务使用独立模型导致高成本和计算开销，MTL通过统一模型联合学习多任务，提高效率和资源利用率。

Method: 综述了MTL在CAV中的应用，涵盖感知、预测、规划、控制和多智能体协作等模块。

Result: MTL在CAV中展现出潜力，但现有方法仍有局限性，如任务冲突和资源分配问题。

Conclusion: 未来研究应关注优化MTL方法，以解决任务冲突并提升CAV系统的实时性和可靠性。

Abstract: Connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) must simultaneously perform multiple
tasks, such as object detection, semantic segmentation, depth estimation,
trajectory prediction, motion prediction, and behaviour prediction, to ensure
safe and reliable navigation in complex environments. Vehicle-to-everything
(V2X) communication enables cooperative driving among CAVs, thereby mitigating
the limitations of individual sensors, reducing occlusions, and improving
perception over long distances. Traditionally, these tasks are addressed using
distinct models, which leads to high deployment costs, increased computational
overhead, and challenges in achieving real-time performance. Multi-task
learning (MTL) has recently emerged as a promising solution that enables the
joint learning of multiple tasks within a single unified model. This offers
improved efficiency and resource utilization. To the best of our knowledge,
this survey is the first comprehensive review focused on MTL in the context of
CAVs. We begin with an overview of CAVs and MTL to provide foundational
background. We then explore the application of MTL across key functional
modules, including perception, prediction, planning, control, and multi-agent
collaboration. Finally, we discuss the strengths and limitations of existing
methods, identify key research gaps, and provide directions for future research
aimed at advancing MTL methodologies for CAV systems.

### [237] [BarlowWalk: Self-supervised Representation Learning for Legged Robot Terrain-adaptive Locomotion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00939)
*Haodong Huang,Shilong Sun,Yuanpeng Wang,Chiyao Li,Hailin Huang,Wenfu Xu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合自监督表示学习的改进PPO方法BarlowWalk，用于双足机器人地形穿越，显著减少训练时间和对外部感知的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主流RL方法训练时间长，影响开发效率，需改进。

Method: 集成Barlow Twins算法构建解耦潜在空间，实现自监督学习，仅需本体感知信息。

Result: 在复杂地形场景中表现优异，实验验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: BarlowWalk显著提升训练效率和性能，适用于复杂地形。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL), driven by data-driven methods, has become an
effective solution for robot leg motion control problems. However, the
mainstream RL methods for bipedal robot terrain traversal, such as
teacher-student policy knowledge distillation, suffer from long training times,
which limit development efficiency. To address this issue, this paper proposes
BarlowWalk, an improved Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) method integrated
with self-supervised representation learning. This method employs the Barlow
Twins algorithm to construct a decoupled latent space, mapping historical
observation sequences into low-dimensional representations and implementing
self-supervision. Meanwhile, the actor requires only proprioceptive information
to achieve self-supervised learning over continuous time steps, significantly
reducing the dependence on external terrain perception. Simulation experiments
demonstrate that this method has significant advantages in complex terrain
scenarios. To enhance the credibility of the evaluation, this study compares
BarlowWalk with advanced algorithms through comparative tests, and the
experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RIMAOS2C是一种基于服务发现的混合网络通信中间件，旨在解决大规模L4自动驾驶车辆部署中的通信需求多样化、数据传输效率优化和调度确定性等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器人中间件难以满足多样化通信需求，优化数据传输效率，并保持调度确定性，特别是在大规模L4自动驾驶车辆部署中。

Method: RIMAOS2C采用多级服务发现组播，支持多种通信模式，包括跨芯片以太网协议和PCIe通信能力。其核心机制Message Bridge优化数据流转发，并使用共享内存进行集中消息分发。

Result: 在L4车辆和Jetson Orin域控制器上测试，RIMAOS2C消除了消息冗余，提高大数据传输效率36%至40%，并减少回调延迟变化42%至906%。

Conclusion: RIMAOS2C提升了机器人操作系统的通信能力，为自动驾驶分布式计算架构中的通信优化提供了新方法。

Abstract: Robotic middleware is fundamental to ensuring reliable communication among
system components and is crucial for intelligent robotics, autonomous vehicles,
and smart manufacturing. However, existing robotic middleware often struggles
to meet the diverse communication demands, optimize data transmission
efficiency, and maintain scheduling determinism between Orin computing units in
large-scale L4 autonomous vehicle deployments. This paper presents RIMAOS2C, a
service discovery-based hybrid network communication middleware designed to
tackle these challenges. By leveraging multi-level service discovery multicast,
RIMAOS2C supports a wide variety of communication modes, including multiple
cross-chip Ethernet protocols and PCIe communication capabilities. Its core
mechanism, the Message Bridge, optimizes data flow forwarding and employs
shared memory for centralized message distribution, reducing message redundancy
and minimizing transmission delay uncertainty. Tested on L4 vehicles and Jetson
Orin domain controllers, RIMAOS2C leverages TCP-based ZeroMQ to overcome the
large-message transmission bottleneck in native CyberRT. In scenarios with two
cross-chip subscribers, it eliminates message redundancy and improves
large-data transmission efficiency by 36 to 40 percent while reducing callback
latency variation by 42 to 906 percent. This research advances the
communication capabilities of robotic operating systems and proposes a novel
approach to optimizing communication in distributed computing architectures for
autonomous driving.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D重建和新视角合成技术的数据收集过程仍依赖人工，效率低下且耗时。

Method: 通过强化学习设计了一个系统化的最佳视角预测框架，包括数据集选择、观测设计、动作空间、奖励计算和学习方案。

Result: Hestia在三个数据集和实际无人机场景中表现稳健，验证了其可行性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: Hestia为自动化数据收集提供了高效解决方案，适用于实际部署。

Abstract: Advances in 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis have enabled
efficient, photorealistic rendering, but the data collection process remains
largely manual, making it time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address the
challenges, this study introduces Hierarchical Next-Best-View Exploration for
Systematic Intelligent Autonomous Data Collection (Hestia), which leverages
reinforcement learning to learn a generalizable policy for 5-DoF next-best
viewpoint prediction. Unlike prior approaches, Hestia systematically defines
the next-best-view task by proposing core components such as dataset choice,
observation design, action space, reward calculation, and learning schemes,
forming a foundation for the planner. Hestia goes beyond prior next-best-view
approaches and traditional capture systems through integration and validation
in a real-world setup, where a drone serves as a mobile sensor for active scene
exploration. Experimental results show that Hestia performs robustly across
three datasets and translated object settings in the NVIDIA IsaacLab
environment, and proves feasible for real-world deployment.

### [240] [Learning Pivoting Manipulation with Force and Vision Feedback Using Optimization-based Demonstrations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01082)
*Yuki Shirai,Kei Ota,Devesh K. Jha,Diego Romeres*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合模型优化和学习的方法，用于非抓取式操作，通过接触隐式轨迹优化和强化学习实现高效学习，并展示了从仿真到现实的迁移能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非抓取式操作因复杂的接触交互而具有挑战性，现有模型方法对模型误差敏感且依赖特权信息，而学习方法需要大量数据。

Method: 结合接触隐式轨迹优化（CITO）和示范引导的深度强化学习（RL），提出了一种特权训练策略以实现仿真到现实的迁移。

Result: 方法在多个旋转任务中成功实现了仿真到现实的迁移，仅需本体感知、视觉和力传感。

Conclusion: 该方法有效结合了模型优化和学习的优势，实现了高效且鲁棒的非抓取式操作。

Abstract: Non-prehensile manipulation is challenging due to complex contact
interactions between objects, the environment, and robots. Model-based
approaches can efficiently generate complex trajectories of robots and objects
under contact constraints. However, they tend to be sensitive to model
inaccuracies and require access to privileged information (e.g., object mass,
size, pose), making them less suitable for novel objects. In contrast,
learning-based approaches are typically more robust to modeling errors but
require large amounts of data. In this paper, we bridge these two approaches to
propose a framework for learning closed-loop pivoting manipulation. By
leveraging computationally efficient Contact-Implicit Trajectory Optimization
(CITO), we design demonstration-guided deep Reinforcement Learning (RL),
leading to sample-efficient learning. We also present a sim-to-real transfer
approach using a privileged training strategy, enabling the robot to perform
pivoting manipulation using only proprioception, vision, and force sensing
without access to privileged information. Our method is evaluated on several
pivoting tasks, demonstrating that it can successfully perform sim-to-real
transfer.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人机竞速需要实时决策和鲁棒控制，但现有LMPC方法在时间最优性和安全性之间存在权衡，且存在实时兼容性问题。

Method: 通过自适应成本函数动态平衡时间最优和中心线跟踪，引入局部安全集防止过度捷径，并使用笛卡尔坐标系避免奇异性和积分误差。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了无人机竞速的峰值性能，同时确保安全性，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Autonomous drone racing presents a challenging control problem, requiring
real-time decision-making and robust handling of nonlinear system dynamics.
While iterative learning model predictive control~(LMPC) offers a promising
framework for iterative performance improvement, its direct application to
drone racing faces challenges like real-time compatibility or the trade-off
between time-optimal and safe traversal. In this paper, we enhance LMPC with
three key innovations:~(1) an adaptive cost function that dynamically weights
time-optimal tracking against centerline adherence,~(2)~a shifted local safe
set to prevent excessive shortcutting and enable more robust iterative updates,
and~(3) a Cartesian-based formulation that accommodates safety constraints
without the singularities or integration errors associated with Frenet-frame
transformations. Results from extensive simulation and real-world experiments
demonstrate that our improved algorithm can optimize initial trajectories
generated by a wide range of controllers with varying levels of tuning for a
maximum improvement in lap time by 60.85\%. Even applied to the most
aggressively tuned state-of-the-art model-based controller, MPCC++, on a real
drone, a 6.05\% improvement is still achieved. Overall, the proposed method
pushes the drone toward faster traversal and avoids collisions in simulation
and real-world experiments, making it a practical solution to improve the peak
performance of drone racing.

TL;DR: 提出了一种人机协作的安全意识推理方法，通过人机红队合作识别和应对潜在危险，提升机器人在高风险任务中的安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注机器人能力提升，而忽视了其在高风险任务中的安全性和信任问题。

Method: 采用人机红队范式，共同挑战环境假设并探索潜在危险，进行危险识别、风险评估、风险缓解和安全报告。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能帮助机器人在不同环境中（如月球栖息地和家庭）安全操作，并适应不同的安全定义。

Conclusion: 人机红队方法可行，能促进安全关键任务中人机团队的信任和安全性。

Abstract: While much research explores improving robot capabilities, there is a deficit
in researching how robots are expected to perform tasks safely, especially in
high-risk problem domains. Robots must earn the trust of human operators in
order to be effective collaborators in safety-critical tasks, specifically
those where robots operate in human environments. We propose the human-robot
red teaming paradigm for safety-aware reasoning. We expect humans and robots to
work together to challenge assumptions about an environment and explore the
space of hazards that may arise. This exploration will enable robots to perform
safety-aware reasoning, specifically hazard identification, risk assessment,
risk mitigation, and safety reporting. We demonstrate that: (a) human-robot red
teaming allows human-robot teams to plan to perform tasks safely in a variety
of domains, and (b) robots with different embodiments can learn to operate
safely in two different environments -- a lunar habitat and a household -- with
varying definitions of safety. Taken together, our work on human-robot red
teaming for safety-aware reasoning demonstrates the feasibility of this
approach for safely operating and promoting trust on human-robot teams in
safety-critical problem domains.

TL;DR: COLLAGE是一种用于少样本模仿学习的数据检索方法，通过自适应融合机制结合多线索选择相关演示数据，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅基于单一特征距离选择数据，可能引入无关演示，导致性能下降。

Result: 在仿真和真实任务中，COLLAGE分别比现有方法提升5.1%和16.6%。

Conclusion: COLLAGE是一种通用且高效的方法，能显著提升少样本模仿学习的性能。

Abstract: In this work, we study the problem of data retrieval for few-shot imitation
learning: selecting data from a large dataset to train a performant policy for
a specific task, given only a few target demonstrations. Prior methods retrieve
data using a single-feature distance heuristic, assuming that the best
demonstrations are those that most closely resemble the target examples in
visual, semantic, or motion space. However, this approach captures only a
subset of the relevant information and can introduce detrimental
demonstrations, e.g., retrieving data from unrelated tasks due to similar scene
layouts, or selecting similar motions from tasks with divergent goals. We
present COLLAGE, a method for COLLective data AGgrEgation in few-shot imitation
learning that uses an adaptive late fusion mechanism to guide the selection of
relevant demonstrations based on a task-specific combination of multiple cues.
COLLAGE follows a simple, flexible, and efficient recipe: it assigns weights to
subsets of the dataset that are pre-selected using a single feature (e.g.,
appearance, shape, or language similarity), based on how well a policy trained
on each subset predicts actions in the target demonstrations. These weights are
then used to perform importance sampling during policy training, sampling data
more densely or sparsely according to estimated relevance. COLLAGE is general
and feature-agnostic, allowing it to combine any number of subsets selected by
any retrieval heuristic, and to identify which subsets provide the greatest
benefit for the target task. In extensive experiments, COLLAGE outperforms
state-of-the-art retrieval and multi-task learning approaches by 5.1% in
simulation across 10 tasks, and by 16.6% in the real world across 6 tasks,
where we perform retrieval from the large-scale DROID dataset. More information

methodology, which leads to its superior form factor, robustness,
replicability, and high performance. With a size and weight similar to a modern

charge and survive meter-high drops with simple repairs. Its 300-dollar bill of
materials includes minimal off-the-shelf components, readily available custom
electronics from online vendors, and structural parts that can be manufactured
on hobbyist 3D printers. A preliminary user assembly study confirms that Q8bot
can be easily replicated, with an average assembly time of under one hour by a
single person. With heuristic open-loop control, Q8bot achieves a stable
walking speed of 5.4 body lengths per second and a turning speed of 5 radians
per second, along with other dynamic movements such as jumping and climbing
moderate slopes.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在动态、以人为中心的环境中，机器人行为规划面临不确定性、实时适应性和安全性的挑战。现有优化方法依赖简化初始化，而学习方法难以满足安全约束。

Method: 提出了一种生成-优化统一框架，结合奖励引导的CFM模型和MPPI控制，实现双向信息交换：CFM提供先验信息，MPPI优化轨迹并反馈。

Result: 在自主社交导航应用中，该方法能灵活适应动态环境，实时满足安全性要求。

Conclusion: 该框架成功结合了学习和优化的优势，为动态环境中的机器人行为规划提供了高效且安全的解决方案。

Abstract: Planning safe and effective robot behavior in dynamic, human-centric
environments remains a core challenge due to the need to handle uncertainty,
adapt in real-time, and ensure safety. Optimization-based planners offer
explicit constraint handling but rely on oversimplified initialization,
reducing solution quality. Learning-based planners better capture multimodal
possible solutions but struggle to enforce constraints such as safety. In this
paper, we introduce a unified generation-refinement framework bridging learning
and optimization with a novel reward-guided conditional flow matching (CFM)
model and model predictive path integral (MPPI) control. Our key innovation is
in the incorporation of a bidirectional information exchange: samples from a
reward-guided CFM model provide informed priors for MPPI refinement, while the
optimal trajectory from MPPI warm-starts the next CFM generation. Using
autonomous social navigation as a motivating application, we demonstrate that
our approach can flexibly adapt to dynamic environments to satisfy safety
requirements in real-time.

Motivation: 现有深度强化学习方法忽视了机器人的形态对称性，导致运动不协调和性能不佳，受人类神经系统对称性的启发，提出了SE-Policy。

Method: SE-Policy框架在演员中嵌入对称等变性，在评论家中嵌入对称不变性，无需额外超参数。

Result: 在仿真和真实实验中，SE-Policy的跟踪精度比现有方法提高40%，并实现了更好的时空协调性。

Conclusion: SE-Policy有效提升了人形机器人的运动协调性和任务性能，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: The human nervous system exhibits bilateral symmetry, enabling coordinated
and balanced movements. However, existing Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)
methods for humanoid robots neglect morphological symmetry of the robot,
leading to uncoordinated and suboptimal behaviors. Inspired by human motor
control, we propose Symmetry Equivariant Policy (SE-Policy), a new DRL
framework that embeds strict symmetry equivariance in the actor and symmetry
invariance in the critic without additional hyperparameters. SE-Policy enforces
consistent behaviors across symmetric observations, producing temporally and
spatially coordinated motions with higher task performance. Extensive
experiments on velocity tracking tasks, conducted in both simulation and
real-world deployment with the Unitree G1 humanoid robot, demonstrate that
SE-Policy improves tracking accuracy by up to 40% compared to state-of-the-art
baselines, while achieving superior spatial-temporal coordination. These
results demonstrate the effectiveness of SE-Policy and its broad applicability
to humanoid robots.

reality. Unlike prior work that treats haptics as a secondary, reactive
channel, VLH synthesizes mid-air force and vibration cues as a direct
consequence of contextual visual understanding and natural language commands.
Our platform comprises an 8-inch quadcopter equipped with dual inverse five-bar
linkage arrays for localized haptic actuation, an egocentric VR camera, and an
exocentric top-down view. Visual inputs and language instructions are processed
by a fine-tuned OpenVLA backbone - adapted via LoRA on a bespoke dataset of 450
multimodal scenarios - to output a 7-dimensional action vector (Vx, Vy, Vz, Hx,
Hy, Hz, Hv). INT8 quantization and a high-performance server ensure real-time
operation at 4-5 Hz. In human-robot interaction experiments (90 flights), VLH
achieved a 56.7% success rate for target acquisition (mean reach time 21.3 s,
pose error 0.24 m) and 100% accuracy in texture discrimination. Generalization
tests yielded 70.0% (visual), 54.4% (motion), 40.0% (physical), and 35.0%
(semantic) performance on novel tasks. These results demonstrate VLH's ability
to co-evolve haptic feedback with perceptual reasoning and intent, advancing
expressive, immersive human-robot interactions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决预规划轨迹在实际任务中可能不够安全、高效或适应动态环境的问题。

Result: 残差学习显著优于从头训练，样本效率和任务性能更优，仿真策略可直接部署于现实系统。

Conclusion: MoRe-ERL框架通用性强，能有效提升轨迹优化和任务性能，仿真到现实的迁移效果良好。

Abstract: We propose MoRe-ERL, a framework that combines Episodic Reinforcement
Learning (ERL) and residual learning, which refines preplanned reference
trajectories into safe, feasible, and efficient task-specific trajectories.
This framework is general enough to incorporate into arbitrary ERL methods and
motion generators seamlessly. MoRe-ERL identifies trajectory segments requiring
modification while preserving critical task-related maneuvers. Then it
generates smooth residual adjustments using B-Spline-based movement primitives
to ensure adaptability to dynamic task contexts and smoothness in trajectory
refinement. Experimental results demonstrate that residual learning
significantly outperforms training from scratch using ERL methods, achieving
superior sample efficiency and task performance. Hardware evaluations further
validate the framework, showing that policies trained in simulation can be
directly deployed in real-world systems, exhibiting a minimal sim-to-real gap.

Abstract: We present RoboMemory, a brain-inspired multi-memory framework for lifelong
learning in physical embodied systems, addressing critical challenges in
real-world environments: continuous learning, multi-module memory latency, task
correlation capture, and infinite-loop mitigation in closed-loop planning.
Grounded in cognitive neuroscience, it integrates four core modules: the
Information Preprocessor (thalamus-like), the Lifelong Embodied Memory System
(hippocampus-like), the Closed-Loop Planning Module (prefrontal lobe-like), and
the Low-Level Executer (cerebellum-like) to enable long-term planning and
cumulative learning. The Lifelong Embodied Memory System, central to the
framework, alleviates inference speed issues in complex memory frameworks via
parallelized updates/retrieval across Spatial, Temporal, Episodic, and Semantic
submodules. It incorporates a dynamic Knowledge Graph (KG) and consistent
architectural design to enhance memory consistency and scalability. Evaluations
on EmbodiedBench show RoboMemory outperforms the open-source baseline
(Qwen2.5-VL-72B-Ins) by 25% in average success rate and surpasses the
closed-source State-of-the-Art (SOTA) (Claude3.5-Sonnet) by 5%, establishing
new SOTA. Ablation studies validate key components (critic, spatial memory,
long-term memory), while real-world deployment confirms its lifelong learning
capability with significantly improved success rates across repeated tasks.
RoboMemory alleviates high latency challenges with scalability, serving as a
foundational reference for integrating multi-modal memory systems in physical
robots.

TL;DR: 提出首个基于物理逆向渲染的照明增强框架，通过分解演示视频的首帧为几何和材质属性，生成不同光照下的外观变化，并利用稳定视频扩散模型确保时间一致性。实验表明，该框架显著减少了行为克隆的泛化差距（40.1%）。

Motivation: 模仿学习训练的模型在光照变化等环境变化下泛化能力不足，现有数据增强方法无法有效解决这一问题。

Method: 利用逆向渲染分解演示视频的首帧为几何和材质属性，生成不同光照下的外观变化；通过微调稳定视频扩散模型实现时间一致性。

Result: 在7自由度机器人上进行了720次真实世界评估，结果显示行为克隆的泛化差距减少了40.1%。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅提升了模仿学习在光照变化下的泛化能力，还支持了三种下游应用。

Abstract: Despite advances in data augmentation, policies trained via imitation
learning still struggle to generalize across environmental variations such as
lighting changes. To address this, we propose the first framework that
leverages physically-based inverse rendering for lighting augmentation on
real-world human demonstrations. Specifically, inverse rendering decomposes the
first frame in each demonstration into geometric (surface normal, depth) and
material (albedo, roughness, metallic) properties, which are then used to
render appearance changes under different lighting. To ensure consistent
augmentation across each demonstration, we fine-tune Stable Video Diffusion on
robot execution videos for temporal lighting propagation. We evaluate our
framework by measuring the structural and temporal consistency of the augmented
sequences, and by assessing its effectiveness in reducing the behavior cloning
generalization gap (40.1%) on a 7-DoF robot across 6 lighting conditions using
720 real-world evaluations. We further showcase three downstream applications
enabled by the proposed framework.

TL;DR: 提出了一种去中心化方法，利用多智能体强化学习（MARL）训练微型飞行器（MAV）团队实现6自由度负载操控，无需全局状态或通信。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有控制器依赖集中式方案，需要全局状态和通信，限制了可扩展性和灵活性。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用MARL训练外环控制策略，仅通过负载姿态观测实现隐式通信，设计了基于线性加速度和体速率的动作空间。

Result: 实验验证了方法的有效性，包括负载模型不确定性下的全姿态控制，性能与集中式方法相当，并展示了异构策略合作和单MAV失效的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 去中心化方法具有高可扩展性、灵活性和低计算成本，适用于现实部署。

Abstract: This paper presents the first decentralized method to enable real-world 6-DoF
manipulation of a cable-suspended load using a team of Micro-Aerial Vehicles
(MAVs). Our method leverages multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to train
an outer-loop control policy for each MAV. Unlike state-of-the-art controllers
that utilize a centralized scheme, our policy does not require global states,
inter-MAV communications, nor neighboring MAV information. Instead, agents
communicate implicitly through load pose observations alone, which enables high
scalability and flexibility. It also significantly reduces computing costs
during inference time, enabling onboard deployment of the policy. In addition,
we introduce a new action space design for the MAVs using linear acceleration
and body rates. This choice, combined with a robust low-level controller,
enables reliable sim-to-real transfer despite significant uncertainties caused
by cable tension during dynamic 3D motion. We validate our method in various
real-world experiments, including full-pose control under load model
uncertainties, showing setpoint tracking performance comparable to the
state-of-the-art centralized method. We also demonstrate cooperation amongst
agents with heterogeneous control policies, and robustness to the complete
in-flight loss of one MAV. Videos of experiments:

TL;DR: HALO是一种新颖的离线奖励学习算法，将人类导航直觉量化为视觉奖励函数，用于机器人导航。通过离线数据和专家轨迹训练奖励模型，结合用户反馈优化，并在实际应用中验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将人类直觉转化为可量化的奖励函数，以提升机器人导航的效率和适应性。

Method: 利用离线数据和专家轨迹，通过Boltzmann分布和用户反馈生成偏好评分，使用Plackett-Luce损失训练奖励模型。

Result: HALO在真实场景中表现优异，成功率和轨迹效率显著提升，优于现有视觉导航方法。

Conclusion: HALO是一种通用且高效的奖励学习方法，适用于多种导航框架，并能推广到未见过的环境和硬件配置。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce HALO, a novel Offline Reward Learning algorithm
that quantifies human intuition in navigation into a vision-based reward
function for robot navigation. HALO learns a reward model from offline data,
leveraging expert trajectories collected from mobile robots. During training,
actions are uniformly sampled around a reference action and ranked using
preference scores derived from a Boltzmann distribution centered on the
preferred action, and shaped based on binary user feedback to intuitive
navigation queries. The reward model is trained via the Plackett-Luce loss to
align with these ranked preferences. To demonstrate the effectiveness of HALO,
we deploy its reward model in two downstream applications: (i) an offline
learned policy trained directly on the HALO-derived rewards, and (ii) a
model-predictive-control (MPC) based planner that incorporates the HALO reward
as an additional cost term. This showcases the versatility of HALO across both
learning-based and classical navigation frameworks. Our real-world deployments
on a Clearpath Husky across diverse scenarios demonstrate that policies trained
with HALO generalize effectively to unseen environments and hardware setups not
present in the training data. HALO outperforms state-of-the-art vision-based
navigation methods, achieving at least a 33.3% improvement in success rate, a
12.9% reduction in normalized trajectory length, and a 26.6% reduction in
Frechet distance compared to human expert trajectories.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 恶劣天气条件（如雾、雨）对自动驾驶感知任务（如语义分割、目标检测）构成挑战。传统域适应方法依赖清晰图像作为参考且难以应对多种恶劣天气混合的情况。

Method: Advent框架包括三个组件：局部序列机制（LSM）利用相邻帧的时间相关性；全局混洗机制（GSM）防止过拟合；展开正则器（URs）增强跨天气泛化能力。

Result: 实验表明，Advent在语义分割任务中显著优于现有基准方法。

Conclusion: Advent框架无需清晰参考，能适应任意恶劣天气条件，为自动驾驶感知任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Various adverse weather conditions such as fog and rain pose a significant
challenge to autonomous driving (AD) perception tasks like semantic
segmentation, object detection, etc. The common domain adaption strategy is to
minimize the disparity between images captured in clear and adverse weather
conditions. However, domain adaption faces two challenges: (I) it typically
relies on utilizing clear image as a reference, which is challenging to obtain
in practice; (II) it generally targets single adverse weather condition and
performs poorly when confronting the mixture of multiple adverse weather
conditions. To address these issues, we introduce a reference-free and Adverse
weather condition-independent (Advent) framework (rather than a specific model
architecture) that can be implemented by various backbones and heads. This is
achieved by leveraging the homogeneity over short durations, getting rid of
clear reference and being generalizable to arbitrary weather condition.
Specifically, Advent includes three integral components: (I) Locally Sequential
Mechanism (LSM) leverages temporal correlations between adjacent frames to
achieve the weather-condition-agnostic effect thanks to the homogeneity behind
arbitrary weather condition; (II) Globally Shuffled Mechanism (GSM) is proposed
to shuffle segments processed by LSM from different positions of input sequence
to prevent the overfitting to LSM-induced temporal patterns; (III) Unfolded
Regularizers (URs) are the deep unfolding implementation of two proposed
regularizers to penalize the model complexity to enhance across-weather
generalization. We take the semantic segmentation task as an example to assess
the proposed Advent framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
proposed Advent outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines with large
margins.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CLASS的方法，通过对比学习和动作序列监督，解决行为克隆在异构数据集上的泛化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 行为克隆在异构数据集（如不同相机视角或物体外观）上表现不佳，容易过拟合单个演示而忽略共享结构。

Method: CLASS利用动态时间规整（DTW）识别相似动作序列，并通过监督对比学习优化软InfoNCE损失。

Result: 在5个仿真基准和3个真实任务中，CLASS表现出色，尤其是在视觉变化显著的下游策略学习中，成功率高达75%。

Conclusion: CLASS通过对比学习显著提升了行为克隆的泛化能力，尤其在视觉变化大的场景中表现优异。

Abstract: Recent advances in Behavior Cloning (BC) have led to strong performance in
robotic manipulation, driven by expressive models, sequence modeling of
actions, and large-scale demonstration data. However, BC faces significant
challenges when applied to heterogeneous datasets, such as visual shift with
different camera poses or object appearances, where performance degrades
despite the benefits of learning at scale. This stems from BC's tendency to
overfit individual demonstrations rather than capture shared structure,
limiting generalization. To address this, we introduce Contrastive Learning via
Action Sequence Supervision (CLASS), a method for learning behavioral
representations from demonstrations using supervised contrastive learning.
CLASS leverages weak supervision from similar action sequences identified via
Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and optimizes a soft InfoNCE loss with
similarity-weighted positive pairs. We evaluate CLASS on 5 simulation
benchmarks and 3 real-world tasks to achieve competitive results using
retrieval-based control with representations only. Most notably, for downstream
policy learning under significant visual shifts, Diffusion Policy with CLASS
pre-training achieves an average success rate of 75%, while all other baseline
methods fail to perform competitively. Project webpage:

Result: 在41个任务中，VFP比基线方法任务成功率提升49%，同时保持高效推理和小模型体积。

Conclusion: VFP在多模态机器人操作任务中表现出色，具有高效性和实用性。

Abstract: Flow-matching-based policies have recently emerged as a promising approach
for learning-based robot manipulation, offering significant acceleration in
action sampling compared to diffusion-based policies. However, conventional
flow-matching methods struggle with multi-modality, often collapsing to
averaged or ambiguous behaviors in complex manipulation tasks. To address this,
we propose the Variational Flow-Matching Policy (VFP), which introduces a
variational latent prior for mode-aware action generation and effectively
captures both task-level and trajectory-level multi-modality. VFP further
incorporates Kantorovich Optimal Transport (K-OT) for distribution-level
alignment and utilizes a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) decoder for mode
specialization and efficient inference. We comprehensively evaluate VFP on 41
tasks across four benchmark environments, demonstrating its effectiveness and
sampling efficiency in both task and path multi-modality settings. Results show
that VFP achieves a $49\%$ relative improvement in task success rate over
standard flow-based baselines, while maintaining fast inference and compact
model size. More details are available on our project page:

the most time-efficient and energy-efficient skyway path and recharging
schedule for each drone in the network. We conduct extensive experiments using

Result: 在150种物体上平均连续成功次数达19.5，最差性能从0.69提升至6.05。

Conclusion: DexReMoE展示了在手部物体重定向任务中的可扩展性和适应性。

Abstract: In hand object reorientation provides capability for dexterous manipulation,
requiring robust control policies to manage diverse object geometries, maintain
stable grasps, and execute precise complex orientation trajectories. However,
prior works focus on single objects or simple geometries and struggle to
generalize to complex shapes. In this work, we introduce DexReMoE (Dexterous
Reorientation Mixture-of-Experts), in which multiple expert policies are
trained for different complex shapes and integrated within a Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) framework, making the approach capable of generalizing across a wide
range of objects. Additionally, we incorporate object category information as
privileged inputs to enhance shape representation. Our framework is trained in
simulation using reinforcement learning (RL) and evaluated on novel
out-of-distribution objects in the most challenging scenario of reorienting
objects held in the air by a downward-facing hand. In terms of the average
consecutive success count, DexReMoE achieves a score of 19.5 across a diverse
set of 150 objects. In comparison to the baselines, it also enhances the
worst-case performance, increasing it from 0.69 to 6.05. These results
underscore the scalability and adaptability of the DexReMoE framework for
general-purpose in-hand reorientation.

Result: 实验结果显示，当前基础模型的表现参差不齐，尚不适合实际应用。

Conclusion: 尽管结果有限，但研究为未来改进VLMs在地形可穿越性估计中的应用提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Terrain traversability estimation is crucial for autonomous robots,
especially in unstructured environments where visual cues and reasoning play a
key role. While vision-language models (VLMs) offer potential for zero-shot
estimation, the problem remains inherently ill-posed. To explore this, we
introduce a small dataset of human-annotated water traversability ratings,
revealing that while estimations are subjective, human raters still show some
consensus. Additionally, we propose a simple pipeline that integrates VLMs for
zero-shot traversability estimation. Our experiments reveal mixed results,
suggesting that current foundation models are not yet suitable for practical
deployment but provide valuable insights for further research.

Conclusion: OpenMap通过结合结构语义和LLM辅助，有效连接自由形式语言与3D感知，为具身导航提供了新方法。

Abstract: Grounding natural language instructions to visual observations is fundamental
for embodied agents operating in open-world environments. Recent advances in
visual-language mapping have enabled generalizable semantic representations by
leveraging vision-language models (VLMs). However, these methods often fall
short in aligning free-form language commands with specific scene instances,
due to limitations in both instance-level semantic consistency and instruction
interpretation. We present OpenMap, a zero-shot open-vocabulary visual-language
map designed for accurate instruction grounding in navigation tasks. To address
semantic inconsistencies across views, we introduce a Structural-Semantic
Consensus constraint that jointly considers global geometric structure and
vision-language similarity to guide robust 3D instance-level aggregation. To
improve instruction interpretation, we propose an LLM-assisted
Instruction-to-Instance Grounding module that enables fine-grained instance
selection by incorporating spatial context and expressive target descriptions.
We evaluate OpenMap on ScanNet200 and Matterport3D, covering both semantic
mapping and instruction-to-target retrieval tasks. Experimental results show
that OpenMap outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in zero-shot settings,
demonstrating the effectiveness of our method in bridging free-form language
and 3D perception for embodied navigation.

Conclusion: 角色扮演隐喻为未来人机交互设计提供了新的思路，强调了创意和表达的重要性。

Abstract: Gestures are an expressive input modality for controlling multiple robots,
but their use is often limited by rigid mappings and recognition constraints.
To move beyond these limitations, we propose roleplaying metaphors as a
scaffold for designing richer interactions. By introducing three roles:
Director, Puppeteer, and Wizard, we demonstrate how narrative framing can guide
the creation of diverse gesture sets and interaction styles. These roles enable
a variety of scenarios, showing how roleplay can unlock new possibilities for
multi-robot systems. Our approach emphasizes creativity, expressiveness, and

Method: 开发了嵌入力传感器的自主系统，并提出了RACCT模型处理复杂管-组织交互和部分视觉观察。

Result: RACCT模型优于ACT模型，平均峰值插入力减少66%，同时保持相同成功率。

Conclusion: 该系统能有效降低感染风险并提高操作安全性。

Abstract: Nasotracheal intubation (NTI) is critical for establishing artificial airways
in clinical anesthesia and critical care. Current manual methods face
significant challenges, including cross-infection, especially during
respiratory infection care, and insufficient control of endoluminal contact
forces, increasing the risk of mucosal injuries. While existing studies have
focused on automated endoscopic insertion, the automation of NTI remains
unexplored despite its unique challenges: Nasotracheal tubes exhibit greater
diameter and rigidity than standard endoscopes, substantially increasing
insertion complexity and patient risks. We propose a novel autonomous NTI
system with two key components to address these challenges. First, an
autonomous NTI system is developed, incorporating a prosthesis embedded with
force sensors, allowing for safety assessment and data filtering. Then, the
Recurrent Action-Confidence Chunking with Transformer (RACCT) model is
developed to handle complex tube-tissue interactions and partial visual
observations. Experimental results demonstrate that the RACCT model outperforms
the ACT model in all aspects and achieves a 66% reduction in average peak
insertion force compared to manual operations while maintaining equivalent
success rates. This validates the system's potential for reducing infection
risks and improving procedural safety.

Magnetically Induced Metamorphic Materials (MIMMs)-based continuum (MC)
exhibits similar bending behaviors. Based on the characteristics of its base
material, MC is flexible in modifying unit stiffness and convenient in molding
fabrication. However, recent studies on magnetic continuum robots have
primarily focused on one or two design parameters, limiting the development of
a comprehensive magnetic continuum bending model. In this work, we constructed
graded-stiffness MCs (GMCs) and developed a numerical model for GMCs' bending
performance, incorporating four key parameters that determine their
performance. The simulated bending results were validated with real bending
experiments in four different categories: varying magnetic field,
cross-section, unit stiffness, and unit length. The graded-stiffness design
strategy applied to GMCs prevents sharp bending at the fixed end and results in
a more circular curvature. We also trained an expansion model for GMCs' bending
performance that is highly efficient and accurate compared to the simulation
process. An extensive library of bending prediction for GMCs was built using
the trained model.

Abstract: Robot-assisted surgery has revolutionized the healthcare industry by
providing surgeons with greater precision, reducing invasiveness, and improving
patient outcomes. However, the success of these surgeries depends heavily on
the robotic system ability to accurately interpret the intentions of the
surgical trainee or even surgeons. One critical factor impacting intent
recognition is the cognitive workload experienced during the procedure. In our
recent research project, we are building an intelligent adaptive system to
monitor cognitive workload and improve learning outcomes in robot-assisted
surgery. The project will focus on achieving a semantic understanding of
surgeon intents and monitoring their mental state through an intelligent
multi-modal assistive framework. This system will utilize brain activity, heart
rate, muscle activity, and eye tracking to enhance intent recognition, even in
mentally demanding situations. By improving the robotic system ability to
interpret the surgeons intentions, we can further enhance the benefits of
robot-assisted surgery and improve surgery outcomes.

Conclusion: 通过利用环境特征，模块化机器人可以突破自身限制，迈向更广泛的实际应用。

Abstract: Modular robotics research has long been preoccupied with perfecting the
modules themselves -- their actuation methods, connectors, controls,
communication, and fabrication. This inward focus results, in part, from the
complexity of the task and largely confines modular robots to sterile
laboratory settings. The latest generation of truss modular robots, such as the
Variable Topology Truss and the Truss Link, have begun to focus outward and
reveal a key insight: the environment is not just a backdrop; it is a tool. In
this work, we shift the paradigm from building better robots to building better
robot environment interactions for modular truss robots. We study how modular
robots can effectively exploit their surroundings to achieve faster locomotion,
adaptive self-reconfiguration, and complex three-dimensional assembly from
simple two-dimensional robot assemblies. By using environment features --
ledges, gaps, and slopes -- we show how the environment can extend the robots'
capabilities. Nature has long mastered this principle: organisms not only
adapt, but exploit their environments to their advantage. Robots must learn to
do the same. This study is a step towards modular robotic systems that
transcend their limitations by exploiting environmental features.

TL;DR: L3M+P（Lifelong LLM+P）框架通过结合经典规划方法和大型语言模型（LLMs），利用外部知识图谱动态更新环境状态，解决了服务机器人在长期连续部署中的规划问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在服务机器人应用中存在两个主要问题：环境状态难以详细一致地描述，以及缺乏动态记忆能力以支持长期任务。

Method: L3M+P使用知识图谱表示世界状态，支持多模态输入更新，并通过规则确保图谱一致性。任务规划时，从图谱中检索上下文并生成经典规划问题定义。

Result: 在家庭机器人模拟器和真实服务机器人上，L3M+P在自然语言状态更新和规划生成方面显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: L3M+P通过知识图谱的动态更新和检索，有效提升了服务机器人的长期规划能力。

Abstract: By combining classical planning methods with large language models (LLMs),
recent research such as LLM+P has enabled agents to plan for general tasks
given in natural language. However, scaling these methods to general-purpose
service robots remains challenging: (1) classical planning algorithms generally
require a detailed and consistent specification of the environment, which is
not always readily available; and (2) existing frameworks mainly focus on
isolated planning tasks, whereas robots are often meant to serve in long-term
continuous deployments, and therefore must maintain a dynamic memory of the
environment which can be updated with multi-modal inputs and extracted as
planning knowledge for future tasks. To address these two issues, this paper
introduces L3M+P (Lifelong LLM+P), a framework that uses an external knowledge
graph as a representation of the world state. The graph can be updated from
multiple sources of information, including sensory input and natural language
interactions with humans. L3M+P enforces rules for the expected format of the
absolute world state graph to maintain consistency between graph updates. At
planning time, given a natural language description of a task, L3M+P retrieves
context from the knowledge graph and generates a problem definition for
classical planners. Evaluated on household robot simulators and on a real-world
service robot, L3M+P achieves significant improvement over baseline methods
both on accurately registering natural language state changes and on correctly
generating plans, thanks to the knowledge graph retrieval and verification.

Abstract: World models have become increasingly popular in acting as learned traffic
simulators. Recent work has explored replacing traditional traffic simulators
with world models for policy training. In this work, we explore the robustness
of existing metrics to evaluate world models as traffic simulators to see if
the same metrics are suitable for evaluating a world model as a
pseudo-environment for policy training. Specifically, we analyze the metametric
employed by the Waymo Open Sim-Agents Challenge (WOSAC) and compare world model
predictions on standard scenarios where the agents are fully or partially
controlled by the world model (partial replay). Furthermore, since we are
interested in evaluating the ego action-conditioned world model, we extend the
standard WOSAC evaluation domain to include agents that are causal to the ego
vehicle. Our evaluations reveal a significant number of scenarios where
top-ranking models perform well under no perturbation but fail when the ego
agent is forced to replay the original trajectory. To address these cases, we
propose new metrics to highlight the sensitivity of world models to
uncontrollable objects and evaluate the performance of world models as
pseudo-environments for policy training and analyze some state-of-the-art world
models under these new metrics.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel quadrotor design capable of folding its arms
vertically to grasp objects and navigate through narrow spaces. The
transformation is controlled actively by a central servomotor, gears, and
racks. The arms connect the motor bases to the central frame, forming a
parallelogram structure that ensures the propellers maintain a constant
orientation during morphing. In its stretched state, the quadrotor resembles a
conventional design, and when contracted, it functions as a gripper with
grasping components emerging from the motor bases. To mitigate disturbances
during transforming and grasping payloads, we employ an adaptive sliding mode
controller with a disturbance observer. After fully folded, the quadrotor frame
shrinks to 67% of its original size. The control performance and versatility of
the morphing quadrotor are validated through real-world experiments.

Abstract: Recent advances in Graphical User Interface (GUI) and embodied navigation
have driven significant progress, yet these domains have largely evolved in
isolation, with disparate datasets and training paradigms. In this paper, we
observe that both tasks can be formulated as Markov Decision Processes (MDP),
suggesting a foundational principle for their unification. Hence, we present
NaviMaster, the first unified agent capable of seamlessly integrating GUI
navigation and embodied navigation within a single framework. Specifically,
NaviMaster (i) proposes a visual-target trajectory collection pipeline that
generates trajectories for both GUI and embodied tasks in one formulation. (ii)
employs a unified reinforcement learning framework on the mix data for better
generalization. (iii) designs a novel distance-aware reward to ensure efficient
learning from the trajectories. Through extensive experiments on out-of-domain
benchmarks, NaviMaster is shown to outperform state-of-the-art agents in GUI
navigation, spatial affordance prediction, and embodied navigation. Ablation
studies further confirm the efficacy of our unified training strategy, data
mixing strategy, and reward design.

Conclusion: RICL成功为VLA模型注入ICL能力，使其能够通过少量演示快速适应新任务，为机器人操作任务提供了简单高效的上下文学习接口。

Abstract: Multi-task ``vision-language-action'' (VLA) models have recently demonstrated
increasing promise as generalist foundation models for robotics, achieving
non-trivial performance out of the box on new tasks in new environments.
However, for such models to be truly useful, an end user must have easy means
to teach them to improve. For language and vision models, the emergent ability
to perform in-context learning (ICL) has proven to be a versatile and highly
useful interface to easily teach new tasks with no parameter finetuning.
Unfortunately, VLAs pre-trained with imitation learning objectives do not
naturally acquire ICL abilities. In this paper, we demonstrate that, with the
right finetuning recipe and a small robot demonstration dataset, it is possible
to inject in-context adaptability post hoc into such a VLA. After retraining
for in-context learning (RICL), our system permits an end user to provide a
small number (10-20) of demonstrations for a new task. RICL then fetches the
most relevant portions of those demonstrations into the VLA context to exploit
ICL, performing the new task and boosting task performance. We apply RICL to
inject ICL into the $\pi_{0}$-FAST VLA, and show that it permits large
in-context improvements for a variety of new manipulation tasks with only 20
demonstrations per task, without any parameter updates. When parameter updates
on the target task demonstrations is possible, RICL finetuning further boosts
performance. We release code and model weights for RICL-$\pi_{0}$-FAST
alongside the paper to enable, for the first time, a simple in-context learning
interface for new manipulation tasks. Website: https://ricl-vla.github.io.

TL;DR: SetItUp是一个神经符号框架，通过学习少量训练示例和结构化自然语言任务规范，预测功能对象排列（FORM）中的目标姿态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FORM任务的指令通常不明确，缺乏目标姿态的具体说明，SetItUp旨在解决这一问题。

Method: SetItUp使用基于抽象空间关系的接地图作为中间表示，分两阶段预测对象姿态：(i)通过LLM生成Python程序预测接地图，(ii)通过扩散模型预测对象姿态。

Result: 在三个任务家族上的实验表明，SetItUp在功能性、物理可行性和美观性上优于现有模型。

Conclusion: SetItUp通过神经符号方法有效解决了FORM任务中的目标姿态预测问题。

Abstract: Functional object arrangement (FORM) is the task of arranging objects to
fulfill a function, e.g., "set up a dining table for two". One key challenge
here is that the instructions for FORM are often under-specified and do not
explicitly specify the desired object goal poses. This paper presents SetItUp,
a neuro-symbolic framework that learns to specify the goal poses of objects
from a few training examples and a structured natural-language task
specification. SetItUp uses a grounding graph, which is composed of abstract
spatial relations among objects (e.g., left-of), as its intermediate
representation. This decomposes the FORM problem into two stages: (i)
predicting this graph among objects and (ii) predicting object poses given the
grounding graph. For (i), SetItUp leverages large language models (LLMs) to
induce Python programs from a task specification and a few training examples.
This program can be executed to generate grounding graphs in novel scenarios.
For (ii), SetItUp pre-trains a collection of diffusion models to capture
primitive spatial relations and online composes these models to predict object
poses based on the grounding graph. We evaluated SetItUp on a dataset spanning
three distinct task families: arranging tableware on a dining table, organizing
items on a bookshelf, and laying out furniture in a bedroom. Experiments show
that SetItUp outperforms existing models in generating functional, physically
feasible, and aesthetically pleasing object arrangements. This article extends
our conference paper published at Robotics: Science and Systems (RSS) 2024.

Conclusion: ScrewSplat提供了一种简单高效的解决方案，适用于实际场景中的关节物体识别与操作。

Abstract: Articulated object recognition -- the task of identifying both the geometry
and kinematic joints of objects with movable parts -- is essential for enabling
robots to interact with everyday objects such as doors and laptops. However,
existing approaches often rely on strong assumptions, such as a known number of
articulated parts; require additional inputs, such as depth images; or involve
complex intermediate steps that can introduce potential errors -- limiting
their practicality in real-world settings. In this paper, we introduce
ScrewSplat, a simple end-to-end method that operates solely on RGB
observations. Our approach begins by randomly initializing screw axes, which
are then iteratively optimized to recover the object's underlying kinematic
structure. By integrating with Gaussian Splatting, we simultaneously
reconstruct the 3D geometry and segment the object into rigid, movable parts.
We demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art recognition accuracy
across a diverse set of articulated objects, and further enables zero-shot,
text-guided manipulation using the recovered kinematic model.

Conclusion: 该框架在力基机器人任务中实现了长期可靠性，显著减少了人工干预需求。

Abstract: The automation of robotic tasks requires high precision and adaptability,
particularly in force-based operations such as insertions. Traditional
learning-based approaches either rely on static datasets, which limit their
ability to generalize, or require frequent manual intervention to maintain good
performances. As a result, ensuring long-term reliability without human
supervision remains a significant challenge. To address this, we propose an
adaptive self-supervised learning framework for insertion classification that
continuously improves its precision over time. The framework operates in
real-time, incrementally refining its classification decisions by integrating
newly acquired force data. Unlike conventional methods, it does not rely on
pre-collected datasets but instead evolves dynamically with each task
execution. Through real-world experiments, we demonstrate how the system
progressively reduces execution time while maintaining near-perfect precision
as more samples are processed. This adaptability ensures long-term reliability
in force-based robotic tasks while minimizing the need for manual intervention.

Conclusion: 矩匹配技术在稀疏和噪声场景中具有潜力，性能接近LiDAR系统。

Abstract: Point cloud registration is a key step in robotic perception tasks, such as
Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). It is especially challenging in
conditions with sparse points and heavy noise. Traditional registration
methods, such as Iterative Closest Point (ICP) and Normal Distributions
Transform (NDT), often have difficulties in achieving a robust and accurate
alignment under these conditions. In this paper, we propose a registration
framework based on moment matching. In particular, the point clouds are
regarded as i.i.d. samples drawn from the same distribution observed in the
source and target frames. We then match the generalized Gaussian Radial Basis
moments calculated from the point clouds to estimate the rigid transformation
between two frames. Moreover, such method does not require explicit
point-to-point correspondences among the point clouds. We further show the
consistency of the proposed method. Experiments on synthetic and real-world
datasets show that our approach achieves higher accuracy and robustness than
existing methods. In addition, we integrate our framework into a 4D Radar SLAM
system. The proposed method significantly improves the localization performance
and achieves results comparable to LiDAR-based systems. These findings
demonstrate the potential of moment matching technique for robust point cloud
registration in sparse and noisy scenarios.

Conclusion: FedVLA为隐私保护的VLA模型训练提供了有效解决方案，兼具高效性和性能。

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models have significantly advanced robotic
manipulation by enabling robots to interpret language instructions for task
execution. However, training these models often relies on large-scale
user-specific data, raising concerns about privacy and security, which in turn
limits their broader adoption. To address this, we propose FedVLA, the first
federated VLA learning framework, enabling distributed model training that
preserves data privacy without compromising performance. Our framework
integrates task-aware representation learning, adaptive expert selection, and
expert-driven federated aggregation, enabling efficient and privacy-preserving
training of VLA models. Specifically, we introduce an Instruction Oriented
Scene-Parsing mechanism, which decomposes and enhances object-level features
based on task instructions, improving contextual understanding. To effectively
learn diverse task patterns, we design a Dual Gating Mixture-of-Experts (DGMoE)
mechanism, where not only input tokens but also self-aware experts adaptively
decide their activation. Finally, we propose an Expert-Driven Aggregation
strategy at the federated server, where model aggregation is guided by
activated experts, ensuring effective cross-client knowledge transfer.Extensive
simulations and real-world robotic experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
our proposals. Notably, DGMoE significantly improves computational efficiency
compared to its vanilla counterpart, while FedVLA achieves task success rates
comparable to centralized training, effectively preserving data privacy.

Abstract: Adept manipulation of articulated objects is essential for robots to operate
successfully in human environments. Such manipulation requires both
effectiveness -- reliable operation despite uncertain object structures -- and
efficiency -- swift execution with minimal redundant steps and smooth actions.
Existing approaches struggle to achieve both objectives simultaneously: methods
relying on predefined kinematic models lack effectiveness when encountering
structural variations, while tactile-informed approaches achieve robust
manipulation without kinematic priors but compromise efficiency through
reactive, step-by-step exploration-compensation cycles. This paper introduces
TacMan-Turbo, a novel proactive tactile control framework for articulated
object manipulation that resolves this fundamental trade-off. Unlike previous
approaches that treat tactile contact deviations merely as error signals
requiring compensation, our method interprets these deviations as rich sources
of local kinematic information. This new perspective enables our controller to
predict optimal future interactions and make proactive adjustments,
significantly enhancing manipulation efficiency. In comprehensive evaluations
across 200 diverse simulated articulated objects and real-world experiments,
our approach maintains a 100% success rate while significantly outperforming
the previous tactile-informed method in time efficiency, action efficiency, and
trajectory smoothness (all p-values < 0.0001). These results demonstrate that
the long-standing trade-off between effectiveness and efficiency in articulated
object manipulation can be successfully resolved without relying on prior
kinematic knowledge.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Chunked RL的新强化学习框架，用于优化Vision-Language-Action (VLA) 模型的微调，通过离线强化学习和动作分块技术解决了样本效率、动作分块兼容性和训练稳定性问题。

Conclusion: CO-RFT通过动作分块和离线强化学习显著提升了VLA模型的性能，展示了强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models demonstrate significant potential for
developing generalized policies in real-world robotic control. This progress
inspires researchers to explore fine-tuning these models with Reinforcement
Learning (RL). However, fine-tuning VLA models with RL still faces challenges
related to sample efficiency, compatibility with action chunking, and training
stability. To address these challenges, we explore the fine-tuning of VLA
models through offline reinforcement learning incorporating action chunking. In
this work, we propose Chunked RL, a novel reinforcement learning framework
specifically designed for VLA models. Within this framework, we extend temporal
difference (TD) learning to incorporate action chunking, a prominent
characteristic of VLA models. Building upon this framework, we propose CO-RFT,
an algorithm aimed at fine-tuning VLA models using a limited set of
demonstrations (30 to 60 samples). Specifically, we first conduct imitation
learning (IL) with full parameter fine-tuning to initialize both the backbone
and the policy. Subsequently, we implement offline RL with action chunking to
optimize the pretrained policy. Our empirical results in real-world
environments demonstrate that CO-RFT outperforms previous supervised methods,
achieving a 57% improvement in success rate and a 22.3% reduction in cycle
time. Moreover, our method exhibits robust positional generalization
capabilities, attaining a success rate of 44.3% in previously unseen positions.

Abstract: This paper proposes an adaptive lattice-based motion planning solution to
address the problem of generating feasible trajectories for systems,
represented by a linearly parameterizable non-linear model operating within a
cluttered environment. The system model is considered to have uncertain model
parameters. The key idea here is to utilize input/output data online to update
the model set containing the uncertain system parameter, as well as a dynamic
estimated parameter of the model, so that the associated model estimation error
reduces over time. This in turn improves the quality of the motion primitives
generated by the lattice-based motion planner using a nominal estimated model
selected on the basis of suitable criteria. The motion primitives are also
equipped with tubes to account for the model mismatch between the nominal
estimated model and the true system model, to guarantee collision-free overall
motion. The tubes are of uniform size, which is directly proportional to the
size of the model set containing the uncertain system parameter. The adaptive
learning module guarantees a reduction in the diameter of the model set as well
as in the parameter estimation error between the dynamic estimated parameter
and the true system parameter. This directly implies a reduction in the size of
the implemented tubes and guarantees that the utilized motion primitives go
arbitrarily close to the resolution-optimal motion primitives associated with
the true model of the system, thus significantly improving the overall motion
planning performance over time. The efficiency of the motion planner is
demonstrated by a suitable simulation example that considers a drone model
represented by Euler-Lagrange dynamics containing uncertain parameters and
operating within a cluttered environment.

Abstract: The control of robots for manipulation tasks generally relies on visual
input. Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) enable the use of
natural language instructions to condition visual input and control robots in a
wider range of environments. However, existing methods require a large amount
of data to fine-tune VLMs for operating in unseen environments. In this paper,
we present a framework that learns object-arrangement tasks from just a few
demonstrations. We propose a two-stage framework that divides
object-arrangement tasks into a target localization stage, for picking the
object, and a region determination stage for placing the object. We present an
instance-level semantic fusion module that aligns the instance-level image
crops with the text embedding, enabling the model to identify the target
objects defined by the natural language instructions. We validate our method on
both simulation and real-world robotic environments. Our method, fine-tuned
with a few demonstrations, improves generalization capability and demonstrates
zero-shot ability in real-robot manipulation scenarios.

Abstract: In physical human-robot collaboration (pHRC) settings, humans and robots
collaborate directly in shared environments. Robots must analyze interactions
with objects to ensure safety and facilitate meaningful workflows. One critical
aspect is human/object detection, where the contacted object is identified.
Past research introduced binary machine learning classifiers to distinguish
between soft and hard objects. This study improves upon those results by
evaluating three-class human/object detection models, offering more detailed
contact analysis. A dataset was collected using the Franka Emika Panda robot
manipulator, exploring preprocessing strategies for time-series analysis.
Models including LSTM, GRU, and Transformers were trained on these datasets.
The best-performing model achieved 91.11\% accuracy during real-time testing,
demonstrating the feasibility of multi-class detection models. Additionally, a
comparison of preprocessing strategies suggests a sliding window approach is
optimal for this task.

the human and the robot create a short imaginary story together, exchanging in
turn cubes with creative images placed on them. To validate the protocol and
the framework, experiments were performed to quantify the degree of usability

Motivation: 由于四足机器人的运动特性和传感器校准复杂性，高质量全景训练数据稀缺，限制了其感知系统的发展。

Method: 提出QuaDreamer引擎，包括垂直抖动编码（VJE）、场景-对象控制器（SOC）和全景增强器（PE），用于生成可控且真实的全景视频。

Result: 生成的视频序列可用于训练四足机器人的全景视觉感知模型，提升360度场景中的多目标跟踪性能。

Conclusion: QuaDreamer为四足机器人提供了高质量的训练数据，推动了其在复杂环境中的感知能力发展。

Abstract: Panoramic cameras, capturing comprehensive 360-degree environmental data, are
suitable for quadruped robots in surrounding perception and interaction with
complex environments. However, the scarcity of high-quality panoramic training
data-caused by inherent kinematic constraints and complex sensor calibration
challenges-fundamentally limits the development of robust perception systems
tailored to these embodied platforms. To address this issue, we propose
QuaDreamer-the first panoramic data generation engine specifically designed for
quadruped robots. QuaDreamer focuses on mimicking the motion paradigm of
quadruped robots to generate highly controllable, realistic panoramic videos,
providing a data source for downstream tasks. Specifically, to effectively
capture the unique vertical vibration characteristics exhibited during
quadruped locomotion, we introduce Vertical Jitter Encoding (VJE). VJE extracts
controllable vertical signals through frequency-domain feature filtering and
provides high-quality prompts. To facilitate high-quality panoramic video
generation under jitter signal control, we propose a Scene-Object Controller
(SOC) that effectively manages object motion and boosts background jitter
control through the attention mechanism. To address panoramic distortions in
wide-FoV video generation, we propose the Panoramic Enhancer (PE)-a dual-stream
architecture that synergizes frequency-texture refinement for local detail
enhancement with spatial-structure correction for global geometric consistency.
We further demonstrate that the generated video sequences can serve as training
data for the quadruped robot's panoramic visual perception model, enhancing the
performance of multi-object tracking in 360-degree scenes. The source code and
model weights will be publicly available at
https://github.com/losehu/QuaDreamer.

Motivation: 现实世界中多机器人系统常因传感和通信故障导致性能下降，但故障感知协调研究不足。

Method: 将故障分为临时和永久两类，通过分组协作和分散优化实现适应。

Result: 在多种故障场景下表现出鲁棒性能，适用于未知危险区域。

Conclusion: 该框架为多机器人系统提供了实用且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-robot coordination is crucial for autonomous systems, yet real-world
deployments often encounter various failures. These include both temporary and
permanent disruptions in sensing and communication, which can significantly
degrade system robustness and performance if not explicitly modeled. Despite
its practical importance, failure-aware coordination remains underexplored in
the literature. To bridge the gap between idealized conditions and the
complexities of real-world environments, we propose a unified failure-aware
coordination framework designed to enable resilient and adaptive multi-robot
target tracking under both temporary and permanent failure conditions. Our
approach systematically distinguishes between two classes of failures: (1)
probabilistic and temporary disruptions, where robots recover from intermittent
sensing or communication losses by dynamically adapting paths and avoiding
inferred danger zones, and (2) permanent failures, where robots lose sensing or
communication capabilities irreversibly, requiring sustained, decentralized
behavioral adaptation. To handle these scenarios, the robot team is partitioned
into subgroups. Robots that remain connected form a communication group and
collaboratively plan using partially centralized nonlinear optimization. Robots
experiencing permanent disconnection or failure continue to operate
independently through decentralized or individual optimization, allowing them
to contribute to the task within their local context. We extensively evaluate
our method across a range of benchmark variations and conduct a comprehensive
assessment under diverse real-world failure scenarios. Results show that our
framework consistently achieves robust performance in realistic environments
with unknown danger zones, offering a practical and generalizable solution for
the multi-robot systems community.

Conclusion: 该系统显著提升了线驱动机器人的自主性和适应性，使其能在多样化环境中工作。

Abstract: In order to expand the operational range and payload capacity of robots,
wire-driven robots that leverage the external environment have been proposed.
It can exert forces and operate in spaces far beyond those dictated by its own
structural limits. However, for practical use, robots must autonomously attach
multiple wires to the environment based on environmental recognition-an
operation so difficult that many wire-driven robots remain restricted to
specialized, pre-designed environments. Here, in this study, we propose a robot
that autonomously connects multiple wires to the environment by employing a
multi-small flying anchor system, as well as an RGB-D camera-based control and
environmental recognition method. Each flying anchor is a drone with an
anchoring mechanism at the wire tip, allowing the robot to attach wires by
flying into position. Using the robot's RGB-D camera to identify suitable
attachment points and a flying anchor position, the system can connect wires in
environments that are not specially prepared, and can also attach multiple
wires simultaneously. Through this approach, a wire-driven robot can
autonomously attach its wires to the environment, thereby realizing the
benefits of wire-driven operation at any location.

Abstract: Robotic cutting is a challenging contact-rich manipulation task where the
robot must simultaneously negotiate unknown object mechanics, large contact
forces, and precise motion requirements. We introduce a new virtual-model
control scheme that enables knife rocking motion for robot manipulators,
without pre-planned trajectories or precise information of the environment.
Motion is generated through interconnection with virtual mechanisms, given by
virtual springs, dampers, and masses arranged in a suitable way. Through
analysis and experiments, we demonstrate that the controlled robot behavior
settles into a periodic motion. Experiments with a Franka manipulator
demonstrate robust cuts with five different vegetables, and sub-millimeter
slice accuracy from 1 mm to 6 mm at nearly one cut per second. The same
controller survives changes in knife shape and cutting board height, and
adaptation to a different humanoid manipulator, demonstrating robustness and
platform independence.

Abstract: Autonomous unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) navigation in orchards presents
significant challenges due to obstacles and GPS-deprived environments. In this
work, we introduce a learning-based approach to achieve vision-based navigation
of UAVs within orchard rows. Our method employs a variational autoencoder
(VAE)-based controller, trained with an intervention-based learning framework
that allows the UAV to learn a visuomotor policy from human experience. We
validate our approach in real orchard environments with a custom-built
quadrotor platform. Field experiments demonstrate that after only a few
iterations of training, the proposed VAE-based controller can autonomously
navigate the UAV based on a front-mounted camera stream. The controller
exhibits strong obstacle avoidance performance, achieves longer flying
distances with less human assistance, and outperforms existing algorithms.
Furthermore, we show that the policy generalizes effectively to novel
environments and maintains competitive performance across varying conditions
and speeds. This research not only advances UAV autonomy but also holds
significant potential for precision agriculture, improving efficiency in
orchard monitoring and management.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled
richer perceptual grounding for code policy generation in embodied agents.
However, most existing systems lack effective mechanisms to adaptively monitor
policy execution and repair codes during task completion. In this work, we
introduce HyCodePolicy, a hybrid language-based control framework that
systematically integrates code synthesis, geometric grounding, perceptual
monitoring, and iterative repair into a closed-loop programming cycle for
embodied agents. Technically, given a natural language instruction, our system
first decomposes it into subgoals and generates an initial executable program
grounded in object-centric geometric primitives. The program is then executed
in simulation, while a vision-language model (VLM) observes selected
checkpoints to detect and localize execution failures and infer failure
reasons. By fusing structured execution traces capturing program-level events
with VLM-based perceptual feedback, HyCodePolicy infers failure causes and
repairs programs. This hybrid dual feedback mechanism enables self-correcting
program synthesis with minimal human supervision. Our results demonstrate that
HyCodePolicy significantly improves the robustness and sample efficiency of
robot manipulation policies, offering a scalable strategy for integrating
multimodal reasoning into autonomous decision-making pipelines.

Abstract: Enabling robots to grasp and reposition human limbs can significantly enhance
their ability to provide assistive care to individuals with severe mobility
impairments, particularly in tasks such as robot-assisted bed bathing and
dressing. However, existing assistive robotics solutions often assume that the
human remains static or quasi-static, limiting their effectiveness. To address
this issue, we present Manip4Care, a modular simulation pipeline that enables
robotic manipulators to grasp and reposition human limbs effectively. Our
approach features a physics simulator equipped with built-in techniques for
grasping and repositioning while considering biomechanical and collision
avoidance constraints. Our grasping method employs antipodal sampling with
force closure to grasp limbs, and our repositioning system utilizes the Model
Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) and vector-field-based control method to
generate motion trajectories under collision avoidance and biomechanical
constraints. We evaluate this approach across various limb manipulation tasks
in both supine and sitting positions and compare outcomes for different age
groups with differing shoulder joint limits. Additionally, we demonstrate our
approach for limb manipulation using a real-world mannequin and further
showcase its effectiveness in bed bathing tasks.

TL;DR: Topolow是一种基于物理启发的无梯度优化框架，用于将非度量数据嵌入低维欧几里得空间，优于传统的多维尺度分析方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在处理非度量或非欧几里得数据时假设失效，需要一种更鲁棒的嵌入方法。

Method: Topolow将对象建模为物理系统中的粒子，通过随机成对交互优化，避免全局梯度计算，并采用Laplace误差模型处理异常值和异构误差。

Result: Topolow在稀疏和非欧几里得数据中表现优于标准MDS方法，能有效重建几何结构。

Conclusion: Topolow为处理非度量数据提供了一种鲁棒的解决方案，扩展了标准分析工具的应用范围。

Abstract: The problem of embedding a set of objects into a low-dimensional Euclidean
space based on a matrix of pairwise dissimilarities is fundamental in data
analysis, machine learning, and statistics. However, the assumptions of many
standard analytical methods are violated when the input dissimilarities fail to
satisfy metric or Euclidean axioms. We present the mathematical and statistical
foundations of Topolow, a physics-inspired, gradient-free optimization
framework for such embedding problems. Topolow is conceptually related to
force-directed graph drawing algorithms but is fundamentally distinguished by
its goal of quantitative metric reconstruction. It models objects as particles
in a physical system, and its novel optimization scheme proceeds through
sequential, stochastic pairwise interactions, which circumvents the need to
compute a global gradient and provides robustness against convergence to local
optima, especially for sparse data. Topolow maximizes the likelihood under a
Laplace error model, robust to outliers and heterogeneous errors, and properly
handles censored data. Crucially, Topolow does not require the input
dissimilarities to be metric, making it a robust solution for embedding
non-metric measurements into a valid Euclidean space, thereby enabling the use
of standard analytical tools. We demonstrate the superior performance of
Topolow compared to standard Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) methods in
reconstructing the geometry of sparse and non-Euclidean data. This paper
formalizes the algorithm, first introduced as Topolow in the context of
antigenic mapping in (Arhami and Rohani, 2025) (open access), with emphasis on
its metric embedding and mathematical properties for a broader audience. The
general-purpose function Euclidify is available in the R package topolow.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel stability measure for edit distances between
merge trees of piecewise linear scalar fields. We apply the new measure to
various metrics introduced recently in the field of scalar field comparison in
scientific visualization. While previous stability measures are unable to
capture the fine-grained hierarchy of the considered distances, we obtain a
classification of stability that fits the efficiency of current implementations
and quality of practical results. Our results induce several open questions
regarding the lacking theoretical analysis of such practical distances.
