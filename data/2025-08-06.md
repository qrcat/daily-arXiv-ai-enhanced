### [2] [Learning Latent Representations for Image Translation using Frequency Distributed CycleGAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03415)
*Shivangi Nigam,Adarsh Prasad Behera,Shekhar Verma,P. Nagabhushan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Fd-CycleGAN是一种改进的CycleGAN框架，通过局部邻域编码和频率感知监督增强图像翻译任务的表现，在多个数据集上表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升CycleGAN在图像翻译任务中的表现，特别是在低数据情况下，通过更好地捕捉局部和全局数据分布特征。

Method: 结合局部邻域编码（LNE）和频率感知监督，使用KL/JS散度和对数相似度度量来量化生成图像与真实图像的分布对齐。

Result: 在Horse2Zebra、Monet2Photo等数据集上，Fd-CycleGAN表现出更高的感知质量、更快的收敛速度和更好的模式多样性。

Conclusion: 频率引导的潜在学习显著提升了图像翻译任务的泛化能力，适用于文档修复、艺术风格迁移和医学图像合成等领域。

Abstract: This paper presents Fd-CycleGAN, an image-to-image (I2I) translation
framework that enhances latent representation learning to approximate real data
distributions. Building upon the foundation of CycleGAN, our approach
integrates Local Neighborhood Encoding (LNE) and frequency-aware supervision to
capture fine-grained local pixel semantics while preserving structural
coherence from the source domain. We employ distribution-based loss metrics,
including KL/JS divergence and log-based similarity measures, to explicitly
quantify the alignment between real and generated image distributions in both
spatial and frequency domains. To validate the efficacy of Fd-CycleGAN, we
conduct experiments on diverse datasets -- Horse2Zebra, Monet2Photo, and a
synthetically augmented Strike-off dataset. Compared to baseline CycleGAN and
other state-of-the-art methods, our approach demonstrates superior perceptual
quality, faster convergence, and improved mode diversity, particularly in
low-data regimes. By effectively capturing local and global distribution
characteristics, Fd-CycleGAN achieves more visually coherent and semantically
consistent translations. Our results suggest that frequency-guided latent
learning significantly improves generalization in image translation tasks, with
promising applications in document restoration, artistic style transfer, and
medical image synthesis. We also provide comparative insights with
diffusion-based generative models, highlighting the advantages of our
lightweight adversarial approach in terms of training efficiency and
qualitative output.

Abstract: Recently, a significant improvement in the accuracy of 3D human pose
estimation has been achieved by combining convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
with pyramid grid alignment feedback loops. Additionally, innovative
breakthroughs have been made in the field of computer vision through the
adoption of Transformer-based temporal analysis architectures. Given these

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖稀缺的配对数据集，且未能充分利用预训练模型和测试输入的先验知识，导致在无约束场景中难以保持细节和一致性。

Method: 第一阶段利用多帧试穿模型和视觉语言模型（VLM）生成高质量关键帧试穿图像；第二阶段结合骨架图和动态描述，通过增强的视频生成模型实现时序一致性。

Result: 实验表明，DreamVVT在保留服装细节和时序稳定性方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DreamVVT通过两阶段设计和预训练模型的有效利用，显著提升了视频虚拟试穿的效果。

Abstract: Video virtual try-on (VVT) technology has garnered considerable academic
interest owing to its promising applications in e-commerce advertising and
entertainment. However, most existing end-to-end methods rely heavily on scarce
paired garment-centric datasets and fail to effectively leverage priors of
advanced visual models and test-time inputs, making it challenging to
accurately preserve fine-grained garment details and maintain temporal
consistency in unconstrained scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose
DreamVVT, a carefully designed two-stage framework built upon Diffusion
Transformers (DiTs), which is inherently capable of leveraging diverse unpaired
human-centric data to enhance adaptability in real-world scenarios. To further
leverage prior knowledge from pretrained models and test-time inputs, in the
first stage, we sample representative frames from the input video and utilize a
multi-frame try-on model integrated with a vision-language model (VLM), to
synthesize high-fidelity and semantically consistent keyframe try-on images.
These images serve as complementary appearance guidance for subsequent video
generation. \textbf{In the second stage}, skeleton maps together with
fine-grained motion and appearance descriptions are extracted from the input
content, and these along with the keyframe try-on images are then fed into a
pretrained video generation model enhanced with LoRA adapters. This ensures
long-term temporal coherence for unseen regions and enables highly plausible
dynamic motions. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate
that DreamVVT surpasses existing methods in preserving detailed garment content
and temporal stability in real-world scenarios. Our project page

### [5] [Elucidating the Role of Feature Normalization in IJEPA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02829)
*Adam Colton*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出在IJEPA架构中，用DynTanh激活替代层归一化（LN），以保留视觉标记的自然能量层次，从而提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 层归一化（LN）破坏了视觉标记的自然能量层次，导致模型无法优先处理语义丰富的区域，并产生棋盘状伪影。

Method: 用DynTanh激活替代LN，以更好地保留标记能量，并允许高能量标记对预测损失贡献更大。

Result: 改进后的模型在ImageNet线性探测准确率从38%提升至42.7%，并在NYU Depth V2单目深度估计中降低RMSE 0.08。

Conclusion: 保留标记的自然能量对自监督视觉表示学习至关重要。

Abstract: In the standard image joint embedding predictive architecture (IJEPA),
features at the output of the teacher encoder are layer normalized (LN) before
serving as a distillation target for the student encoder and predictor. We
propose that this feature normalization disrupts the natural energy hierarchy
of visual tokens, where high-energy tokens (those with larger L2 norms) encode
semantically important image regions. LN forces all features to have identical
L2 norms, effectively equalizing their energies and preventing the model from
prioritizing semantically rich regions. We find that IJEPA models trained with
feature LN exhibit loss maps with significant checkerboard-like artifacts. We
propose that feature LN be replaced with a DynTanh activation as the latter
better preserves token energies and allows high-energy tokens to greater
contribute to the prediction loss. We show that IJEPA trained with feature
DynTanh exhibits a longer-tailed loss distribution and fixes the checkerboard
artifacts in the loss map. Our empirical results show that our simple
modification improves ImageNet linear probe accuracy from 38% to 42.7% for
ViT-Small and reduces RMSE by 0.08 on NYU Depth V2 monocular depth estimation.
These results suggest that preserving natural token energies is crucial for
effective self-supervised visual representation learning.

### [6] [GENIE: Gaussian Encoding for Neural Radiance Fields Interactive Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02831)
*Mikołaj Zieliński,Krzysztof Byrski,Tomasz Szczepanik,Przemysław Spurek*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GENIE结合NeRF的高保真渲染和GS的可编辑性，通过高斯特征嵌入和高效邻近搜索实现实时交互编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决NeRF隐含编码难以编辑和物理交互的问题，同时保留其高质量渲染能力。

Method: 使用高斯特征嵌入条件化NeRF网络，引入RT-GPS高效邻近搜索和多分辨率哈希网格。

Result: 实现实时、局部感知的编辑，支持动态交互和物理模拟兼容。

Conclusion: GENIE成功结合隐式和显式表示的优势，填补几何编辑与神经渲染之间的空白。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and Gaussian Splatting (GS) have recently
transformed 3D scene representation and rendering. NeRF achieves high-fidelity
novel view synthesis by learning volumetric representations through neural
networks, but its implicit encoding makes editing and physical interaction
challenging. In contrast, GS represents scenes as explicit collections of
Gaussian primitives, enabling real-time rendering, faster training, and more
intuitive manipulation. This explicit structure has made GS particularly
well-suited for interactive editing and integration with physics-based
simulation. In this paper, we introduce GENIE (Gaussian Encoding for Neural
Radiance Fields Interactive Editing), a hybrid model that combines the
photorealistic rendering quality of NeRF with the editable and structured
representation of GS. Instead of using spherical harmonics for appearance
modeling, we assign each Gaussian a trainable feature embedding. These
embeddings are used to condition a NeRF network based on the k nearest
Gaussians to each query point. To make this conditioning efficient, we
introduce Ray-Traced Gaussian Proximity Search (RT-GPS), a fast nearest
Gaussian search based on a modified ray-tracing pipeline. We also integrate a
multi-resolution hash grid to initialize and update Gaussian features.
Together, these components enable real-time, locality-aware editing: as
Gaussian primitives are repositioned or modified, their interpolated influence
is immediately reflected in the rendered output. By combining the strengths of
implicit and explicit representations, GENIE supports intuitive scene
manipulation, dynamic interaction, and compatibility with physical simulation,
bridging the gap between geometry-based editing and neural rendering. The code
can be found under (https://github.com/MikolajZielinski/genie)

### [7] [RefineSeg: Dual Coarse-to-Fine Learning for Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02844)
*Anghong Du,Nay Aung,Theodoros N. Arvanitis,Stefan K. Piechnik,Joao A C Lima,Steffen E. Petersen,Le Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于粗标注的医学图像分割框架，通过建模粗标注中的噪声区域，逐步优化分割结果，接近全监督方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像的高质量像素级标注成本高且需要专业知识，粗标注虽易获取但存在噪声。

Method: 引入转移矩阵建模粗标注的不准确区域，通过联合训练多组粗标注逐步优化分割结果。

Result: 在两个公开心脏影像数据集上表现优异，接近全监督方法，优于现有弱监督方法。

Conclusion: 该框架有效利用粗标注，为医学图像分割提供了一种低成本高性能的解决方案。

Abstract: High-quality pixel-level annotations of medical images are essential for
supervised segmentation tasks, but obtaining such annotations is costly and
requires medical expertise. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
coarse-to-fine segmentation framework that relies entirely on coarse-level
annotations, encompassing both target and complementary drawings, despite their
inherent noise. The framework works by introducing transition matrices in order
to model the inaccurate and incomplete regions in the coarse annotations. By
jointly training on multiple sets of coarse annotations, it progressively
refines the network's outputs and infers the true segmentation distribution,
achieving a robust approximation of precise labels through matrix-based
modeling. To validate the flexibility and effectiveness of the proposed method,
we demonstrate the results on two public cardiac imaging datasets, ACDC and
MSCMRseg, and further evaluate its performance on the UK Biobank dataset.
Experimental results indicate that our approach surpasses the state-of-the-art
weakly supervised methods and closely matches the fully supervised approach.

### [8] [MIDAR: Mimicking LiDAR Detection for Traffic Applications with a Lightweight Plug-and-Play Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02858)
*Tianheng Zhu,Yiheng Feng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MIDAR是一个模拟LiDAR检测的模型，用于在微观交通模拟器中生成接近真实的LiDAR检测结果，弥补了现有模拟工具的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模拟工具在自动驾驶研究中存在局限性：游戏引擎模拟器（如CARLA）在多车场景下扩展性差，而微观交通模拟器（如SUMO）缺乏感知建模能力。

Method: MIDAR通过车辆级特征预测真实LiDAR检测结果，构建RM-LoS图编码遮挡关系，并采用GRU增强的APPNP架构进行特征传播。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上，MIDAR的AUC达到0.909，接近主流3D LiDAR检测模型CenterPoint的结果。

Conclusion: MIDAR能无缝集成到交通模拟器和轨迹数据中，为需要精确车辆观测的任务提供支持，并将开源发布。

Abstract: As autonomous driving (AD) technology advances, increasing research has
focused on leveraging cooperative perception (CP) data collected from multiple
AVs to enhance traffic applications. Due to the impracticality of large-scale
real-world AV deployments, simulation has become the primary approach in most
studies. While game-engine-based simulators like CARLA generate high-fidelity
raw sensor data (e.g., LiDAR point clouds) which can be used to produce
realistic detection outputs, they face scalability challenges in multi-AV
scenarios. In contrast, microscopic traffic simulators such as SUMO scale
efficiently but lack perception modeling capabilities. To bridge this gap, we
propose MIDAR, a LiDAR detection mimicking model that approximates realistic
LiDAR detections using vehicle-level features readily available from
microscopic traffic simulators. Specifically, MIDAR predicts true positives
(TPs) and false negatives (FNs) from ideal LiDAR detection results based on the
spatial layouts and dimensions of surrounding vehicles. A Refined Multi-hop
Line-of-Sight (RM-LoS) graph is constructed to encode the occlusion
relationships among vehicles, upon which MIDAR employs a GRU-enhanced APPNP
architecture to propagate features from the ego AV and occluding vehicles to
the prediction target. MIDAR achieves an AUC of 0.909 in approximating the
detection results generated by CenterPoint, a mainstream 3D LiDAR detection
model, on the nuScenes AD dataset. Two CP-based traffic applications further
validate the necessity of such realistic detection modeling, particularly for
tasks requiring accurate individual vehicle observations (e.g., position,
speed, lane index). As demonstrated in the applications, MIDAR can be
seamlessly integrated into traffic simulators and trajectory datasets and will
be open-sourced upon publication.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文探讨了基于Transformer的神经网络在高分辨率卫星图像中的目标检测性能，并与卷积网络进行了比较。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着Transformer在计算机视觉中的兴起，需要评估其在遥感数据上的表现。

Method: 比较了11种目标检测算法，包括5种Transformer架构和6种卷积网络，在3个公开数据集上训练和评估了33个模型。

Result: Transformer架构在多种基准数据集上表现出色，展示了最新的性能。

Conclusion: Transformer在遥感图像目标检测中具有潜力，但仍需进一步研究其适用性。

Abstract: In 2012, AlexNet established deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) as
the state-of-the-art in CV, as these networks soon led in visual tasks for many
domains, including remote sensing. With the publication of Visual Transformers,
we are witnessing the second modern leap in computational vision, and as such,
it is imperative to understand how various transformer-based neural networks
perform on satellite imagery. While transformers have shown high levels of
performance in natural language processing and CV applications, they have yet
to be compared on a large scale to modern remote sensing data. In this paper,
we explore the use of transformer-based neural networks for object detection in
high-resolution electro-optical satellite imagery, demonstrating
state-of-the-art performance on a variety of publicly available benchmark data
sets. We compare eleven distinct bounding-box detection and localization
algorithms in this study, of which seven were published since 2020, and all
eleven since 2015. The performance of five transformer-based architectures is
compared with six convolutional networks on three state-of-the-art opensource
high-resolution remote sensing imagery datasets ranging in size and complexity.
Following the training and evaluation of thirty-three deep neural models, we
then discuss and analyze model performance across various feature extraction
methodologies and detection algorithms.

### [10] [VisuCraft: Enhancing Large Vision-Language Models for Complex Visual-Guided Creative Content Generation via Structured Information Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02890)
*Rongxin Jiang,Robert Long,Chenghao Gu,Mingrui Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisuCraft是一个新框架，通过结合多模态结构化信息提取器和动态提示生成模块，显著提升大型视觉语言模型在复杂视觉引导创意内容生成中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型视觉语言模型在生成长文本时难以保持高视觉保真度、真实创意和精确遵循用户指令。VisuCraft旨在解决这些问题。

Method: VisuCraft整合了多模态结构化信息提取器（E）和动态提示生成模块（G），提取输入图像的细粒度视觉属性并生成优化提示。

Result: 在ImageStoryGen-500K数据集上评估，VisuCraft在故事生成和诗歌创作等任务中表现优于基线模型，尤其在创意和指令遵循方面有显著提升。

Conclusion: VisuCraft为大型视觉语言模型在复杂创意AI应用中开辟了新潜力。

Abstract: This paper introduces VisuCraft, a novel framework designed to significantly
enhance the capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in complex
visual-guided creative content generation. Existing LVLMs often exhibit
limitations in maintaining high visual fidelity, genuine creativity, and
precise adherence to nuanced user instructions when generating long-form texts.
VisuCraft addresses these challenges by integrating a multimodal structured
information extractor (E) and a dynamic prompt generation module (G). The
extractor distills fine-grained visual attributes from input images into a
rich, structured representation, which the dynamic prompt module then combines
with user instructions to create highly optimized prompts for underlying LVLMs
(e.g., LLaVA, InstructBLIP). Evaluated on the self-constructed
ImageStoryGen-500K dataset using VisuGen Metrics (Visual Grounding, Creativity,
and Instruction Adherence), VisuCraft consistently outperforms baseline LVLMs
across tasks like story generation and poetry composition. Our results
demonstrate remarkable improvements, particularly in creativity and instruction
adherence, validating VisuCraft's effectiveness in producing imaginative,
visually grounded, and user-aligned long-form creative text. This work unlocks
new potential for LVLMs in sophisticated creative AI applications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统扩散模型需要正常数据训练，限制了实际应用。本文旨在解决仅有污染数据时的异常分割问题。

Result: 在MVTec数据集上，AUROC提高8.08%，AUPRC提高10.37%。

Conclusion: 该方法在仅有污染数据时表现优于现有扩散模型，具有更高的灵活性和性能。

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion models have demonstrated significant success
in unsupervised anomaly segmentation. For anomaly segmentation, these models
are first trained on normal data; then, an anomalous image is noised to an
intermediate step, and the normal image is reconstructed through backward
diffusion. Unlike traditional statistical methods, diffusion models do not rely
on specific assumptions about the data or target anomalies, making them
versatile for use across different domains. However, diffusion models typically
assume access to normal data for training, limiting their applicability in
realistic settings. In this paper, we propose novel robust denoising diffusion
models for scenarios where only contaminated (i.e., a mix of normal and
anomalous) unlabeled data is available. By casting maximum likelihood
estimation of the data as a nonlinear regression problem, we reinterpret the
denoising diffusion probabilistic model through a regression lens. Using robust
regression, we derive a robust version of denoising diffusion probabilistic
models. Our novel framework offers flexibility in constructing various robust
diffusion models. Our experiments show that our approach outperforms current
state of the art diffusion models, for unsupervised anomaly segmentation when
only contaminated data is available. Our method outperforms existing
diffusion-based approaches, achieving up to 8.08\% higher AUROC and 10.37\%
higher AUPRC on MVTec datasets. The implementation code is available at:

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于材料配置的声学轮廓生成任务，通过编码器-解码器方法生成目标房间脉冲响应（RIR），并创建了新数据集用于评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何通过用户定义的材料配置（如地毯和声学瓷砖）改变室内声学特性，生成目标声学轮廓。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能有效编码材料信息并生成高保真RIR，为声学轮廓生成提供了新方向。

Abstract: How would the sound in a studio change with a carpeted floor and acoustic
tiles on the walls? We introduce the task of material-controlled acoustic
profile generation, where, given an indoor scene with specific audio-visual
characteristics, the goal is to generate a target acoustic profile based on a
user-defined material configuration at inference time. We address this task
with a novel encoder-decoder approach that encodes the scene's key properties
from an audio-visual observation and generates the target Room Impulse Response
(RIR) conditioned on the material specifications provided by the user. Our
model enables the generation of diverse RIRs based on various material
configurations defined dynamically at inference time. To support this task, we
create a new benchmark, the Acoustic Wonderland Dataset, designed for
developing and evaluating material-aware RIR prediction methods under diverse
and challenging settings. Our results demonstrate that the proposed model
effectively encodes material information and generates high-fidelity RIRs,
outperforming several baselines and state-of-the-art methods.

*Vebjørn Haug Kåsene,Pierre Lison*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文探讨了现成的大型视觉语言模型（LVLM）在视觉与语言导航（VLN）任务中的潜力，验证了其在低级和全景动作空间中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究现成LVLM在VLN任务中的适用性，填补其在此领域未被充分探索的空白。

Method: 通过微调开源模型Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct在R2R数据集上，评估其在低级和全景动作空间中的性能。

Result: 最佳模型在R2R测试集上达到41%的成功率，表明现成LVLM虽能学习VLN任务，但仍落后于专用模型。

Conclusion: 现成LVLM在VLN任务中具有一定潜力，但需进一步优化以匹敌专用模型。

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) refers to the task of enabling
autonomous robots to navigate unfamiliar environments by following natural
language instructions. While recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have
shown promise in this task, most current VLM systems rely on models
specifically designed and optimized for navigation, leaving the potential of
off-the-shelf LVLMs underexplored. Furthermore, while older VLN approaches used
low-level action spaces with egocentric views and atomic actions (such as "turn
left" or "move forward"), newer models tend to favor panoramic action spaces
with discrete navigable viewpoints. This paper investigates (1) whether
off-the-shelf LVLMs (fine-tuned without architectural modifications or
simulator-based training) can effectively support VLN tasks and (2) whether
such models can support both low-level and panoramic action paradigms. To this
end, we fine-tune the open-source model Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct on the
Room-to-Room (R2R) dataset and evaluate its empirical performance across both
low-level and panoramic action spaces. The best resulting model achieves a 41%
success rate on the R2R test set, demonstrating that while off-the-shelf LVLMs
can learn to perform Vision-and-Language Navigation, they still lag behind
models specifically designed for this task.

### [14] [How Diffusion Prior Landscapes Shape the Posterior in Blind Deconvolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02923)
*Minh-Hai Nguyen,Edouard Pauwels,Pierre Weiss*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAP估计在盲去卷积中倾向于模糊解，但扩散先验揭示了局部极小值对应自然图像，需良好初始化以克服MAP限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究MAP估计与稀疏先验结合时倾向于模糊解的问题，探索扩散先验如何揭示更优解。

Method: 通过分析扩散先验的似然景观，发现模糊图像似然更高，但局部极小值对应自然图像；理论分析盲去卷积后验。

Result: MAP估计倾向于产生锐化滤波器和模糊解，而梯度下降可找到对应自然图像的局部极小值。

Conclusion: 克服MAP限制需良好初始化，扩散先验和优化技术设计有实际应用价值。

Abstract: The Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation is a widely used framework in blind
deconvolution to recover sharp images from blurred observations. The estimated
image and blur filter are defined as the maximizer of the posterior
distribution. However, when paired with sparsity-promoting image priors, MAP
estimation has been shown to favors blurry solutions, limiting its
effectiveness. In this paper, we revisit this result using diffusion-based
priors, a class of models that capture realistic image distributions. Through
an empirical examination of the prior's likelihood landscape, we uncover two
key properties: first, blurry images tend to have higher likelihoods; second,
the landscape contains numerous local minimizers that correspond to natural
images. Building on these insights, we provide a theoretical analysis of the
blind deblurring posterior. This reveals that the MAP estimator tends to
produce sharp filters (close to the Dirac delta function) and blurry solutions.
However local minimizers of the posterior, which can be obtained with gradient
descent, correspond to realistic, natural images, effectively solving the blind
deconvolution problem. Our findings suggest that overcoming MAP's limitations
requires good local initialization to local minima in the posterior landscape.
We validate our analysis with numerical experiments, demonstrating the
practical implications of our insights for designing improved priors and
optimization techniques.

different operational conditions and modalities, but at the same time run on
small embedded devices, with limited hardware. While for normal size models,
pre-training is known to be very beneficial in accuracy and robustness, for
small models, that can be employed for embedded and edge devices, its effect is
not clear. In this work, we investigate the effect of ImageNet pretraining on
increasingly small backbone architectures (ultra-small models, with $<$1M
parameters) with respect to robustness in downstream object detection tasks in
the infrared visual modality. Using scaling laws derived from standard object
recognition architectures, we construct two ultra-small backbone families and
systematically study their performance. Our experiments on three different
datasets reveal that while ImageNet pre-training is still useful, beyond a
certain capacity threshold, it offers diminishing returns in terms of
out-of-distribution detection robustness. Therefore, we advise practitioners to
still use pre-training and, when possible avoid too small models as while they
might work well for in-domain problems, they are brittle when working
conditions are different.

TL;DR: X-Actor是一个新颖的音频驱动肖像动画框架，通过单张参考图像和音频输入生成逼真、情感丰富的说话头部视频。其核心是两阶段解耦生成流程，结合自回归扩散模型和视频合成模块，实现长时情感连贯的动画效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法多关注唇同步和短时视觉保真度，而X-Actor旨在实现演员级的长时肖像表演，捕捉动态演化的情感，与语音节奏和内容连贯。

Method: 采用两阶段解耦生成流程：1) 音频条件自回归扩散模型预测身份无关的面部运动潜在标记；2) 扩散视频合成模块将运动转化为高保真视频。通过扩散强制训练范式捕捉长时音频与面部动态关联。

Result: X-Actor生成具有电影风格的表演，超越标准说话头部动画，在长时音频驱动情感肖像表演中达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: X-Actor通过解耦设计和扩散模型，实现了长时情感连贯的高质量肖像动画，为音频驱动表演提供了新方向。

Abstract: We present X-Actor, a novel audio-driven portrait animation framework that
generates lifelike, emotionally expressive talking head videos from a single
reference image and an input audio clip. Unlike prior methods that emphasize
lip synchronization and short-range visual fidelity in constrained speaking
scenarios, X-Actor enables actor-quality, long-form portrait performance
capturing nuanced, dynamically evolving emotions that flow coherently with the
rhythm and content of speech. Central to our approach is a two-stage decoupled
generation pipeline: an audio-conditioned autoregressive diffusion model that
predicts expressive yet identity-agnostic facial motion latent tokens within a
long temporal context window, followed by a diffusion-based video synthesis
module that translates these motions into high-fidelity video animations. By
operating in a compact facial motion latent space decoupled from visual and
identity cues, our autoregressive diffusion model effectively captures
long-range correlations between audio and facial dynamics through a
diffusion-forcing training paradigm, enabling infinite-length emotionally-rich
motion prediction without error accumulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that X-Actor produces compelling, cinematic-style performances that go beyond
standard talking head animations and achieves state-of-the-art results in
long-range, audio-driven emotional portrait acting.

*Dawei Zhang,Xiaojie Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于尺度等变性的盲去噪框架，通过异构归一化模块和交互门控模块提升模型在空间非均匀噪声下的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有去噪模型在分布外噪声（尤其是空间变化噪声）下泛化能力不足，尺度等变性被视为提升鲁棒性的关键。

Method: 设计了异构归一化模块（HNM）和交互门控模块（IGM），分别用于稳定特征分布和动态调整特征路径。

Result: 模型在合成和真实数据集上均优于现有方法，尤其在空间异质噪声下表现突出。

Conclusion: 尺度等变性是提升去噪模型鲁棒性的有效归纳偏置，提出的框架在复杂噪声条件下具有显著优势。

Abstract: Despite notable advances in image denoising, existing models often struggle
to generalize beyond in-distribution noise patterns, particularly when
confronted with out-of-distribution (OOD) conditions characterized by spatially
variant noise. This generalization gap remains a fundamental yet underexplored
challenge. In this work, we investigate \emph{scale equivariance} as a core
inductive bias for improving OOD robustness. We argue that incorporating
scale-equivariant structures enables models to better adapt from training on
spatially uniform noise to inference on spatially non-uniform degradations.
Building on this insight, we propose a robust blind denoising framework
equipped with two key components: a Heterogeneous Normalization Module (HNM)
and an Interactive Gating Module (IGM). HNM stabilizes feature distributions
and dynamically corrects features under varying noise intensities, while IGM
facilitates effective information modulation via gated interactions between
signal and feature paths. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our model
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and
real-world benchmarks, especially under spatially heterogeneous noise. Code
will be made publicly available.

*Alakh Desai,Nuno Vasconcelos*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ANSWER是一种无需训练的采样方法，通过利用扩散模型对否定的内部理解，提高生成图像与提示的符合度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在生成高质量图像时，对提示的符合度和质量存在显著差异。负提示虽能改善符合度，但需要外部资源且不完整。

Method: 提出ANSWER方法，结合负提示和分类器自由引导（CFG），从单一提示中同时满足正负条件。

Result: ANSWER在多个基准测试中优于基线方法，人类评价中更受欢迎。

Conclusion: ANSWER是一种高效且无需额外训练的技术，适用于支持CFG的任何模型。

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have demonstrated an unparalleled ability to create
diverse and high-fidelity images from text prompts. However, they are also
well-known to vary substantially regarding both prompt adherence and quality.
Negative prompting was introduced to improve prompt compliance by specifying
what an image must not contain. Previous works have shown the existence of an
ideal negative prompt that can maximize the odds of the positive prompt. In
this work, we explore relations between negative prompting and classifier-free
guidance (CFG) to develop a sampling procedure, {\it Adaptive Negative Sampling
Without External Resources} (ANSWER), that accounts for both positive and
negative conditions from a single prompt. This leverages the internal
understanding of negation by the diffusion model to increase the odds of
generating images faithful to the prompt. ANSWER is a training-free technique,
applicable to any model that supports CFG, and allows for negative grounding of
image concepts without an explicit negative prompts, which are lossy and
incomplete. Experiments show that adding ANSWER to existing DMs outperforms the
baselines on multiple benchmarks and is preferred by humans 2x more over the
other methods.

Motivation: 现有多领域学习架构中，共享LoRA和领域特定LoRA的结构是否有效捕捉领域特定信息尚不明确。

Method: 提出一种方法，将共享和领域特定LoRA分别置于预训练权重的列空间和左零子空间中。

Result: 在三个动作识别数据集（UCF101、Kinetics400和HMDB51）上验证了方法的有效性，并分析了LoRA权重的维度。

Conclusion: 该方法在某些情况下有效，同时提供了LoRA权重维度的分析。

Abstract: Existing architectures of multi-domain learning have two types of adapters:
shared LoRA for all domains and domain-specific LoRA for each particular
domain. However, it remains unclear whether this structure effectively captures
domain-specific information. In this paper, we propose a method that ensures
that shared and domain-specific LoRAs exist in different subspaces;
specifically, the column and left null subspaces of the pre-trained weights. We
apply the proposed method to action recognition with three datasets (UCF101,
Kinetics400, and HMDB51) and demonstrate its effectiveness in some cases along
with the analysis of the dimensions of LoRA weights.

Abstract: Modern action recognition models suffer from static bias, leading to reduced

domain adaptation between RGB and edge information using edge frames in
addition to RGB frames to counter the static bias issue. Experiments
demonstrate that the proposed method effectively suppresses static bias with a
lower computational cost, allowing for more robust action recognition than
previous approaches.

TL;DR: AFOG是一种针对目标检测变换器的注意力聚焦对抗梯度攻击方法，能够有效攻击CNN和变换器检测器，性能提升显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗扰动方法在攻击变换器检测器时效果有限，AFOG旨在解决这一问题。

Method: AFOG通过可学习的注意力机制聚焦扰动于脆弱区域，结合特征损失和迭代注入扰动。

Result: AFOG在COCO数据集上表现优异，性能提升达83%，速度快且扰动不易察觉。

Conclusion: AFOG是一种高效、隐蔽的对抗攻击方法，适用于多种目标检测架构。

Abstract: Adversarial perturbations are useful tools for exposing vulnerabilities in
neural networks. Existing adversarial perturbation methods for object detection
are either limited to attacking CNN-based detectors or weak against
transformer-based detectors. This paper presents an Attention-Focused Offensive
Gradient (AFOG) attack against object detection transformers. By design, AFOG
is neural-architecture agnostic and effective for attacking both large
transformer-based object detectors and conventional CNN-based detectors with a
unified adversarial attention framework. This paper makes three original
contributions. First, AFOG utilizes a learnable attention mechanism that
focuses perturbations on vulnerable image regions in multi-box detection tasks,
increasing performance over non-attention baselines by up to 30.6%. Second,
AFOG's attack loss is formulated by integrating two types of feature loss
through learnable attention updates with iterative injection of adversarial
perturbations. Finally, AFOG is an efficient and stealthy adversarial
perturbation method. It probes the weak spots of detection transformers by
adding strategically generated and visually imperceptible perturbations which
can cause well-trained object detection models to fail. Extensive experiments
conducted with twelve large detection transformers on COCO demonstrate the
efficacy of AFOG. Our empirical results also show that AFOG outperforms
existing attacks on transformer-based and CNN-based object detectors by up to
83% with superior speed and imperceptibility. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于扩散过程的噪声预测信号检测NSFW内容的方法（IGD），在七类NSFW内容上平均检测准确率达91.32%，优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在生成高质量图像的同时可能被滥用于生成NSFW内容，现有方法主要关注生成前或生成后的检测，而生成过程中的检测尚未充分探索。

Method: 利用扩散过程中预测的噪声作为内部信号，通过语义线索区分NSFW与良性提示。

Result: 在七类NSFW内容上，IGD的平均检测准确率为91.32%，优于七种基线方法。

Conclusion: IGD是一种简单有效的NSFW内容检测方法，尤其适用于对抗性提示场景。

Abstract: Diffusion-based text-to-image (T2I) models enable high-quality image
generation but also pose significant risks of misuse, particularly in producing
not-safe-for-work (NSFW) content. While prior detection methods have focused on
filtering prompts before generation or moderating images afterward, the
in-generation phase of diffusion models remains largely unexplored for NSFW
detection. In this paper, we introduce In-Generation Detection (IGD), a simple
yet effective approach that leverages the predicted noise during the diffusion
process as an internal signal to identify NSFW content. This approach is
motivated by preliminary findings suggesting that the predicted noise may
capture semantic cues that differentiate NSFW from benign prompts, even when
the prompts are adversarially crafted. Experiments conducted on seven NSFW
categories show that IGD achieves an average detection accuracy of 91.32% over
naive and adversarial NSFW prompts, outperforming seven baseline methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为MGFC的新框架，通过多粒度特征校准提升域广义语义分割的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注全局特征微调，忽视了特征层次的多粒度适应，而这对密集预测任务至关重要。

Method: MGFC框架通过粗到细的特征校准，依次优化全局、类别级和空间细节特征。

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验表明，MGFC优于现有方法，验证了多粒度适应的有效性。

Conclusion: MGFC通过层次化和粒度感知的特征校准，成功将视觉基础模型的泛化能力迁移到域广义语义分割任务中。

Abstract: Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation (DGSS) aims to improve the
generalization ability of models across unseen domains without access to target
data during training. Recent advances in DGSS have increasingly exploited
vision foundation models (VFMs) via parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies.
However, most existing approaches concentrate on global feature fine-tuning,
while overlooking hierarchical adaptation across feature levels, which is
crucial for precise dense prediction. In this paper, we propose
Multi-Granularity Feature Calibration (MGFC), a novel framework that performs
coarse-to-fine alignment of VFM features to enhance robustness under domain
shifts. Specifically, MGFC first calibrates coarse-grained features to capture
global contextual semantics and scene-level structure. Then, it refines
medium-grained features by promoting category-level feature discriminability.
Finally, fine-grained features are calibrated through high-frequency spatial
detail enhancement. By performing hierarchical and granularity-aware
calibration, MGFC effectively transfers the generalization strengths of VFMs to
the domain-specific task of DGSS. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art DGSS approaches,
highlighting the effectiveness of multi-granularity adaptation for the semantic
segmentation task of domain generalization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SLFG的新方法，通过将视频帧组合成语义连贯的场景帧，显著提升了多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在长视频理解中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前MLLMs在长视频理解中表现不佳，主要因为资源限制无法处理所有帧及其信息，且现有框架和任务与实际需求不符。

Method: 提出了SceneQA任务和LVSQA数据集，并开发了SLFG方法，结合场景定位和动态帧重组机制。

Result: SLFG在多个长视频基准测试中表现优异，且无需修改原始模型架构。

Conclusion: SLFG方法有效提升了MLLMs的长视频理解能力，具有即插即用的实用性。

Abstract: Current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often perform poorly in long
video understanding, primarily due to resource limitations that prevent them
from processing all video frames and their associated information. Efficiently
extracting relevant information becomes a challenging task. Existing frameworks
and evaluation tasks focus on identifying specific frames containing core
objects from a large number of irrelevant frames, which does not align with the
practical needs of real-world applications. To address this issue, we propose a
new scenario under the video question-answering task, SceneQA, which emphasizes
scene-based detail perception and reasoning abilities. And we develop the LVSQA
dataset to support the SceneQA task, which is built upon carefully selected
videos from LVBench and contains a new collection of question-answer pairs to
promote a more fair evaluation of MLLMs' scene perception abilities in long
videos. Inspired by human cognition, we introduce a novel method called SLFG.
The core idea of SLFG is to combine individual frames into semantically
coherent scene frames. By leveraging scene localization methods and dynamic
frame reassembly mechanisms, SLFG significantly enhances the understanding
capabilities of existing MLLMs in long videos. SLFG requires no modification to
the original model architecture and boasts excellent plug-and-play usability.
Experimental results show that this method performs exceptionally well in
several long video benchmark tests. Code and dataset will be released at
http://www.slfg.pkuzwh.cn.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在压缩高斯模型时难以识别真正不重要的高斯点，导致存储需求高且渲染质量下降。

Method: SA-3DGS通过学习重要性评分识别不重要高斯点，利用聚类模块压缩属性，并通过修复模块恢复信息。

Result: 实验显示，SA-3DGS实现了高达66倍的压缩，同时保持或提升渲染质量。

Conclusion: SA-3DGS不仅高效压缩，还能提升其他基于剪枝的方法，具有优异的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting have enhanced efficient and
high-quality novel view synthesis. However, representing scenes requires a
large number of Gaussian points, leading to high storage demands and limiting
practical deployment. The latest methods facilitate the compression of Gaussian
models but struggle to identify truly insignificant Gaussian points in the
scene, leading to a decline in subsequent Gaussian pruning, compression
quality, and rendering performance. To address this issue, we propose SA-3DGS,
a method that significantly reduces storage costs while maintaining rendering
quality. SA-3DGS learns an importance score to automatically identify the least
significant Gaussians in scene reconstruction, thereby enabling effective
pruning and redundancy reduction. Next, the importance-aware clustering module
compresses Gaussians attributes more accurately into the codebook, improving
the codebook's expressive capability while reducing model size. Finally, the
codebook repair module leverages contextual scene information to repair the
codebook, thereby recovering the original Gaussian point attributes and
mitigating the degradation in rendering quality caused by information loss.
Experimental results on several benchmark datasets show that our method
achieves up to 66x compression while maintaining or even improving rendering
quality. The proposed Gaussian pruning approach is not only adaptable to but
also improves other pruning-based methods (e.g., LightGaussian), showcasing
excellent performance and strong generalization ability.

Conclusion: MoCA通过创新机制显著提升了T2V生成中的身份一致性和细节表现。

Abstract: Achieving ID-preserving text-to-video (T2V) generation remains challenging
despite recent advances in diffusion-based models. Existing approaches often
fail to capture fine-grained facial dynamics or maintain temporal identity
coherence. To address these limitations, we propose MoCA, a novel Video
Diffusion Model built on a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) backbone, incorporating
a Mixture of Cross-Attention mechanism inspired by the Mixture-of-Experts
paradigm. Our framework improves inter-frame identity consistency by embedding
MoCA layers into each DiT block, where Hierarchical Temporal Pooling captures
identity features over varying timescales, and Temporal-Aware Cross-Attention
Experts dynamically model spatiotemporal relationships. We further incorporate
a Latent Video Perceptual Loss to enhance identity coherence and fine-grained
details across video frames. To train this model, we collect CelebIPVid, a
dataset of 10,000 high-resolution videos from 1,000 diverse individuals,
promoting cross-ethnicity generalization. Extensive experiments on CelebIPVid
show that MoCA outperforms existing T2V methods by over 5% across Face
similarity.

Abstract: Cross-video question answering presents significant challenges beyond
traditional single-video understanding, particularly in establishing meaningful
connections across video streams and managing the complexity of multi-source
information retrieval. We introduce VideoForest, a novel framework that
addresses these challenges through person-anchored hierarchical reasoning. Our
approach leverages person-level features as natural bridge points between
videos, enabling effective cross-video understanding without requiring
end-to-end training. VideoForest integrates three key innovations: 1) a
human-anchored feature extraction mechanism that employs ReID and tracking
algorithms to establish robust spatiotemporal relationships across multiple
video sources; 2) a multi-granularity spanning tree structure that
hierarchically organizes visual content around person-level trajectories; and
3) a multi-agent reasoning framework that efficiently traverses this
hierarchical structure to answer complex cross-video queries. To evaluate our
approach, we develop CrossVideoQA, a comprehensive benchmark dataset
specifically designed for person-centric cross-video analysis. Experimental
results demonstrate VideoForest's superior performance in cross-video reasoning
tasks, achieving 71.93% accuracy in person recognition, 83.75% in behavior
analysis, and 51.67% in summarization and reasoning, significantly
outperforming existing methods. Our work establishes a new paradigm for
cross-video understanding by unifying multiple video streams through
person-level features, enabling sophisticated reasoning across distributed
visual information while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Existing studies on talking video generation have predominantly focused on
single-person monologues or isolated facial animations, limiting their
applicability to realistic multi-human interactions. To bridge this gap, we
introduce MIT, a large-scale dataset specifically designed for multi-human
talking video generation. To this end, we develop an automatic pipeline that
collects and annotates multi-person conversational videos. The resulting
dataset comprises 12 hours of high-resolution footage, each featuring two to
four speakers, with fine-grained annotations of body poses and speech
interactions. It captures natural conversational dynamics in multi-speaker
scenario, offering a rich resource for studying interactive visual behaviors.
To demonstrate the potential of MIT, we furthur propose CovOG, a baseline model
for this novel task. It integrates a Multi-Human Pose Encoder (MPE) to handle
varying numbers of speakers by aggregating individual pose embeddings, and an
Interactive Audio Driver (IAD) to modulate head dynamics based on
speaker-specific audio features. Together, these components showcase the
feasibility and challenges of generating realistic multi-human talking videos,
establishing MIT as a valuable benchmark for future research. The code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有面部滤镜在遮挡情况下性能下降，需要一种新方法分离遮挡物与面部区域。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：教师模型预测alpha遮罩和不确定性，学生模型通过知识蒸馏优化。

Result: FaceMat在多个基准测试中优于现有方法，提升了真实视频场景中的视觉质量和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: FaceMat无需辅助输入，适用于实时应用，并构建了CelebAMat数据集支持研究。

Abstract: Face filters have become a key element of short-form video content, enabling
a wide array of visual effects such as stylization and face swapping. However,
their performance often degrades in the presence of occlusions, where objects
like hands, hair, or accessories obscure the face. To address this limitation,
we introduce the novel task of face matting, which estimates fine-grained alpha
mattes to separate occluding elements from facial regions. We further present
FaceMat, a trimap-free, uncertainty-aware framework that predicts high-quality
alpha mattes under complex occlusions. Our approach leverages a two-stage
training pipeline: a teacher model is trained to jointly estimate alpha mattes
and per-pixel uncertainty using a negative log-likelihood (NLL) loss, and this
uncertainty is then used to guide the student model through spatially adaptive
knowledge distillation. This formulation enables the student to focus on
ambiguous or occluded regions, improving generalization and preserving semantic
consistency. Unlike previous approaches that rely on trimaps or segmentation
masks, our framework requires no auxiliary inputs making it well-suited for
real-time applications. In addition, we reformulate the matting objective by
explicitly treating skin as foreground and occlusions as background, enabling
clearer compositing strategies. To support this task, we newly constructed
CelebAMat, a large-scale synthetic dataset specifically designed for
occlusion-aware face matting. Extensive experiments show that FaceMat
outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks, enhancing the
visual quality and robustness of face filters in real-world, unconstrained
video scenarios. The source code and CelebAMat dataset are available at

TL;DR: 论文提出CHARM框架，通过互补学习实现模态间的和谐协作，而非同质化，显著提升多模态语义分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过显式特征对齐实现模态同质化，削弱了各模态的独特优势与互补性。CHARM旨在通过互补学习框架实现模态间的和谐协作。

Method: CHARM包含两个组件：(1) Mutual Perception Unit (MPU)，通过窗口跨模态交互隐式对齐内容；(2) 双路径优化策略，解耦训练为互补融合学习（CoL）和保护模态特定优化（InE）。

Result: 实验表明CHARM在多个数据集和骨干网络上优于基线，尤其在脆弱模态上表现显著提升。

Conclusion: CHARM将焦点从同质化转向和谐化，实现了多样性的真正互补与和谐。

Abstract: Modality-agnostic Semantic Segmentation (MaSS) aims to achieve robust scene
understanding across arbitrary combinations of input modality. Existing methods
typically rely on explicit feature alignment to achieve modal homogenization,
which dilutes the distinctive strengths of each modality and destroys their
inherent complementarity. To achieve cooperative harmonization rather than
homogenization, we propose CHARM, a novel complementary learning framework
designed to implicitly align content while preserving modality-specific
advantages through two components: (1) Mutual Perception Unit (MPU), enabling
implicit alignment through window-based cross-modal interaction, where
modalities serve as both queries and contexts for each other to discover
modality-interactive correspondences; (2) A dual-path optimization strategy
that decouples training into Collaborative Learning Strategy (CoL) for
complementary fusion learning and Individual Enhancement Strategy (InE) for
protected modality-specific optimization. Experiments across multiple datasets
and backbones indicate that CHARM consistently outperform the baselines, with
significant increment on the fragile modalities. This work shifts the focus
from model homogenization to harmonization, enabling cross-modal
complementarity for true harmony in diversity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决不同摄像头源图像特征差异导致的UDA行人重识别问题，提升模型在跨域场景下的表现。

Method: 框架分为预训练和微调阶段：预训练使用CycleGAN生成多样数据；微调阶段通过师生网络和多级聚类生成伪标签，并引入可学习的集成融合组件优化特征。

Result: 在三个常见UDA行人重识别任务中表现优于现有方法，Mean Average Precision、Top-1、Top-5和Top-10指标显著提升。

Conclusion: CORE-ReID框架通过清晰的特征融合和避免歧义，成为UDA行人重识别的高效解决方案，代码和模型已开源。

Abstract: This study introduces a novel framework, "Comprehensive Optimization and
Refinement through Ensemble Fusion in Domain Adaptation for Person
Re-identification (CORE-ReID)", to address an Unsupervised Domain Adaptation
(UDA) for Person Re-identification (ReID). The framework utilizes CycleGAN to
generate diverse data that harmonizes differences in image characteristics from
different camera sources in the pre-training stage. In the fine-tuning stage,
based on a pair of teacher-student networks, the framework integrates
multi-view features for multi-level clustering to derive diverse pseudo labels.
A learnable Ensemble Fusion component that focuses on fine-grained local
information within global features is introduced to enhance learning
comprehensiveness and avoid ambiguity associated with multiple pseudo-labels.
Experimental results on three common UDAs in Person ReID demonstrate
significant performance gains over state-of-the-art approaches. Additional
enhancements, such as Efficient Channel Attention Block and Bidirectional Mean
Feature Normalization mitigate deviation effects and adaptive fusion of global
and local features using the ResNet-based model, further strengthening the
framework. The proposed framework ensures clarity in fusion features, avoids
ambiguity, and achieves high ac-curacy in terms of Mean Average Precision,
Top-1, Top-5, and Top-10, positioning it as an advanced and effective solution
for the UDA in Person ReID. Our codes and models are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SSFMamba是一种基于Mamba的对称驱动空间-频率特征融合网络，用于3D医学图像分割，通过双分支架构和Mamba块融合空间与频率域特征，提升全局上下文建模能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在3D医学图像分割中未能充分利用频率域信息的独特性质（如共轭对称性）及其与空间域的数据分布差异，导致频率域优势被稀释或掩盖。

Method: 提出SSFMamba，采用双分支架构分别提取空间和频率域特征，利用Mamba块融合异构特征，并设计3D多方向扫描机制强化局部与全局线索融合。

Result: 在BraTS2020和BraTS2023数据集上的实验表明，SSFMamba在多项评估指标上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SSFMamba通过有效融合空间与频率域特征，显著提升了3D医学图像分割的性能。

Abstract: In light of the spatial domain's limited capacity for modeling global context
in 3D medical image segmentation, emerging approaches have begun to incorporate
frequency domain representations. However, straightforward feature extraction
strategies often overlook the unique properties of frequency domain
information, such as conjugate symmetry. They also fail to account for the
fundamental differences in data distribution between the spatial and frequency
domains, which can ultimately dilute or obscure the complementary strengths
that frequency-based representations offer. In this paper, we propose SSFMamba,
a Mamba based Symmetry-driven Spatial-Frequency feature fusion network for 3D
medical image segmentation. SSFMamba employs a complementary dual-branch
architecture that extracts features from both the spatial and frequency
domains, and leverages a Mamba block to fuse these heterogeneous features to
preserve global context while reinforcing local details. In the frequency
domain branch, we harness Mamba's exceptional capability to extract global
contextual information in conjunction with the synergistic effect of frequency
domain features to further enhance global modeling. Moreover, we design a 3D
multi-directional scanning mechanism to strengthen the fusion of local and
global cues. Extensive experiments on the BraTS2020 and BraTS2023 datasets
demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods
across various evaluation metrics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出RobustGS模块，增强3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）在恶劣成像条件下的鲁棒性，实现高质量3D重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有前馈3DGS方法假设输入多视图图像干净高质量，但实际场景中图像常受噪声、低光或雨水等影响，导致重建质量下降。

Method: 引入通用退化学习器和语义感知状态空间模型，增强退化感知能力并提升特征空间中的输入质量。

Result: 实验表明，RobustGS模块能显著提升多种退化条件下的重建质量。

Conclusion: RobustGS模块可无缝集成现有方法，实现高质量3D重建，尤其在恶劣成像条件下表现优异。

Abstract: Feedforward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) overcomes the limitations of
optimization-based 3DGS by enabling fast and high-quality reconstruction
without the need for per-scene optimization. However, existing feedforward
approaches typically assume that input multi-view images are clean and
high-quality. In real-world scenarios, images are often captured under
challenging conditions such as noise, low light, or rain, resulting in
inaccurate geometry and degraded 3D reconstruction. To address these
challenges, we propose a general and efficient multi-view feature enhancement
module, RobustGS, which substantially improves the robustness of feedforward
3DGS methods under various adverse imaging conditions, enabling high-quality 3D
reconstruction. The RobustGS module can be seamlessly integrated into existing
pretrained pipelines in a plug-and-play manner to enhance reconstruction
robustness. Specifically, we introduce a novel component, Generalized
Degradation Learner, designed to extract generic representations and
distributions of multiple degradations from multi-view inputs, thereby
enhancing degradation-awareness and improving the overall quality of 3D
reconstruction. In addition, we propose a novel semantic-aware state-space
model. It first leverages the extracted degradation representations to enhance
corrupted inputs in the feature space. Then, it employs a semantic-aware
strategy to aggregate semantically similar information across different views,
enabling the extraction of fine-grained cross-view correspondences and further
improving the quality of 3D representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our approach, when integrated into existing methods in a plug-and-play
manner, consistently achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality across
various types of degradations.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注人口属性（如种族和性别）的公平性，而更广泛属性的公平性尚未充分探索。

Method: 利用大型语言模型（LLMs）构建开放集偏见属性知识库，评估LVLMs在细粒度属性上的公平性。

Result: 实验结果显示，LVLMs在多样化属性上表现出偏见，且文化、环境和行为因素对决策的影响更显著。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在评估LVLMs公平时需考虑更广泛的属性，尤其是非人口因素。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of applications using Large Vision-Language Models
(LVLMs), such as GPT-4o, has raised significant concerns about their fairness.
While existing studies primarily focus on demographic attributes such as race
and gender, fairness across a broader range of attributes remains largely
unexplored. In this study, we construct an open-set knowledge base of bias
attributes leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and evaluate the fairness of
LVLMs across finer-grained attributes. Our experimental results reveal that
LVLMs exhibit biased outputs across a diverse set of attributes and further
demonstrate that cultural, environmental, and behavioral factors have a more
pronounced impact on LVLM decision-making than traditional demographic
attributes.

Motivation: 现有伪袋增强方法因采样实例来源有限导致多样性不足，且引入新实例可能增加关键实例数量，影响模型在肿瘤区域较小的测试切片上的表现。

Method: 提出$C^2Aug$方法，从所有同类袋中采样实例以增加伪袋多样性，并引入袋级和组级对比学习框架以增强特征区分能力。

Result: 实验表明，$C^2Aug$在多个评估指标上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: $C^2Aug$通过增加伪袋多样性和结合对比学习，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Recent pseudo-bag augmentation methods for Multiple Instance Learning
(MIL)-based Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification sample instances from a
limited number of bags, resulting in constrained diversity. To address this
issue, we propose Contrastive Cross-Bag Augmentation ($C^2Aug$) to sample
instances from all bags with the same class to increase the diversity of
pseudo-bags. However, introducing new instances into the pseudo-bag increases
the number of critical instances (e.g., tumor instances). This increase results
in a reduced occurrence of pseudo-bags containing few critical instances,
thereby limiting model performance, particularly on test slides with small
tumor areas. To address this, we introduce a bag-level and group-level
contrastive learning framework to enhance the discrimination of features with
distinct semantic meanings, thereby improving model performance. Experimental
results demonstrate that $C^2Aug$ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches across multiple evaluation metrics.

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用大型语言模型生成的视觉概念作为语义指导的持续学习框架，通过跨模态注意力模块提升分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅依赖简单的文本模板，忽略了丰富的语义信息，限制了医学图像分类系统在动态临床环境中的适应性。

Method: 动态构建视觉概念池，采用相似性过滤机制避免冗余；通过跨模态图像-概念注意力模块和注意力损失整合概念。

Result: 在医学和自然图像数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法有效且优越，代码将公开。

Abstract: Continual learning is essential for medical image classification systems to
adapt to dynamically evolving clinical environments. The integration of
multimodal information can significantly enhance continual learning of image
classes. However, while existing approaches do utilize textual modality
information, they solely rely on simplistic templates with a class name,
thereby neglecting richer semantic information. To address these limitations,
we propose a novel framework that harnesses visual concepts generated by large
language models (LLMs) as discriminative semantic guidance. Our method
dynamically constructs a visual concept pool with a similarity-based filtering
mechanism to prevent redundancy. Then, to integrate the concepts into the
continual learning process, we employ a cross-modal image-concept attention
module, coupled with an attention loss. Through attention, the module can
leverage the semantic knowledge from relevant visual concepts and produce
class-representative fused features for classification. Experiments on medical
and natural image datasets show our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance, demonstrating the effectiveness and superiority of our method. We
will release the code publicly.

TL;DR: AVATAR框架通过离策略训练和时序优势塑造解决了多模态视频推理中的数据效率、优势消失和信用分配问题，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法（如GRPO）在数据效率、优势消失和信用分配方面的局限性。

Method: 提出AVATAR框架，包括离策略训练架构和时序优势塑造（TAS）策略。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，性能提升显著（如MMVU +5.4），样本效率提高35%以上。

Conclusion: AVATAR有效解决了多模态视频推理中的关键问题，性能显著优于基线方法。

Abstract: Multimodal reasoning over long-horizon video is challenging due to the need
for precise spatiotemporal fusion and alignment across modalities. While recent
methods such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) have shown promise in
this domain, they suffer from three key limitations: (1) data inefficiency from
their on-policy design, (2) a vanishing advantage problem, where identical or
near-identical rewards within a group eliminate the learning signal by
producing zero-valued advantages, and (3) uniform credit assignment that fails
to emphasize critical reasoning steps. We introduce AVATAR (Audio-Video Agent
for Alignment and Reasoning), a framework that addresses these limitations
through two core components: (1) an off-policy training architecture that
improves sample efficiency and resolves vanishing advantages by reusing past
experiences with greater reward diversity, and (2) Temporal Advantage Shaping
(TAS), a novel credit assignment strategy that upweights key reasoning phases
during learning. AVATAR achieves strong performance across various benchmarks,
outperforming the Qwen2.5-Omni baseline by +5.4on MMVU, +4.9 on OmniBench, and
+4.5 on Video-Holmes, while demonstrating over 35% higher sample efficiency.

TL;DR: 提出Causal CLIP Adapter (CCA)，通过无监督独立成分分析(ICA)显式解耦CLIP提取的视觉特征，减少可训练参数并避免过拟合，同时增强跨模态对齐，显著提升少样本学习性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有少样本学习方法依赖隐式解耦表示，限制了模型适应能力。基于CLIP的多模态对比学习可线性解耦表示，但可能破坏模态对齐。

Method: CCA利用ICA显式解耦CLIP视觉特征，并通过单向（微调文本分类器）和双向（跨注意力机制）增强跨模态对齐，结合单模态和跨模态分类输出。

Result: 在11个基准数据集上，CCA在少样本性能和分布偏移鲁棒性上优于现有方法，同时保持计算效率。

Conclusion: CCA通过显式解耦和增强跨模态对齐，显著提升了少样本学习的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Few-shot learning (FSL) often requires effective adaptation of models using
limited labeled data. However, most existing FSL methods rely on entangled
representations, requiring the model to implicitly recover the unmixing process
to obtain disentangled representations using only limited supervision, which
hinders effective adaptation. Recent theoretical studies show that multimodal
contrastive learning methods, such as CLIP, can disentangle latent
representations up to linear transformations. In light of this, we propose the
Causal CLIP Adapter (CCA), a novel framework that explicitly disentangles
visual features extracted from CLIP using unsupervised Independent Component
Analysis (ICA). This removes the need to learn the unmixing process from the
labeled data, thereby reducing the number of trainable parameters and
mitigating overfitting. Taking a step further, while ICA can obtain visual
disentangled representations, it may also disrupt CLIP's intra- and inter-modal
alignment. To counteract this, CCA further leverages CLIP's inherent
cross-modal alignment by enhancing it in two ways: unidirectionally, through
fine-tuning a CLIP-based text classifier, and bidirectionally, via a
cross-attention mechanism that enriches visual and textual representations
through mutual interaction. Both unimodal and cross-modal classification
outputs can be effectively combined linearly to improve classification
accuracy. Extensive experiments on 11 benchmark datasets demonstrate that our
method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of
few-shot performance and robustness to distributional shifts, while maintaining
computational efficiency. Code will be available at

TL;DR: COFFEE是一种实时姿态估计框架，用于解决空间未知天体姿态估计中的阴影问题，比传统方法更准确且计算效率更高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法（如SIFT、ORB、AKAZE）在空间未知天体姿态估计中因阴影导致偏差的问题，同时克服深度学习方法的计算资源需求。

Method: 利用太阳相位角先验信息，通过稀疏神经网络和注意力图神经网络匹配特征，实现阴影不变的特征检测。

Result: 在合成数据和小行星Apophis的渲染数据上，COFFEE比传统方法更准确，计算速度快一个数量级。

Conclusion: COFFEE是一种无偏差、高精度且高效的实时姿态估计解决方案，适用于空间任务。

Abstract: The accurate state estimation of unknown bodies in space is a critical
challenge with applications ranging from the tracking of space debris to the
shape estimation of small bodies. A necessary enabler to this capability is to
find and track features on a continuous stream of images. Existing methods,
such as SIFT, ORB and AKAZE, achieve real-time but inaccurate pose estimates,
whereas modern deep learning methods yield higher quality features at the cost
of more demanding computational resources which might not be available on
space-qualified hardware. Additionally, both classical and data-driven methods
are not robust to the highly opaque self-cast shadows on the object of
interest. We show that, as the target body rotates, these shadows may lead to
large biases in the resulting pose estimates. For these objects, a bias in the
real-time pose estimation algorithm may mislead the spacecraft's state
estimator and cause a mission failure, especially if the body undergoes a
chaotic tumbling motion. We present COFFEE, the Celestial Occlusion Fast
FEature Extractor, a real-time pose estimation framework for asteroids designed
to leverage prior information on the sun phase angle given by sun-tracking
sensors commonly available onboard spacecraft. By associating salient contours
to their projected shadows, a sparse set of features are detected, invariant to
the motion of the shadows. A Sparse Neural Network followed by an
attention-based Graph Neural Network feature matching model are then jointly
trained to provide a set of correspondences between successive frames. The
resulting pose estimation pipeline is found to be bias-free, more accurate than
classical pose estimation pipelines and an order of magnitude faster than other
state-of-the-art deep learning pipelines on synthetic data as well as on
renderings of the tumbling asteroid Apophis.

Motivation: 现有方法在3D重建中存在几何精度与鲁棒性的权衡问题，H3R旨在通过混合框架解决这一局限性。

Method: H3R结合了体积潜在融合和基于注意力的特征聚合，包括几何一致的潜在体积和相机感知的Transformer。

Conclusion: H3R通过混合框架实现了更快的收敛和更强的泛化能力，为3D重建提供了新思路。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting, generalizable
3D reconstruction remains challenging, particularly in multi-view
correspondence modeling. Existing approaches face a fundamental trade-off:
explicit methods achieve geometric precision but struggle with ambiguous
regions, while implicit methods provide robustness but suffer from slow
convergence. We present H3R, a hybrid framework that addresses this limitation
by integrating volumetric latent fusion with attention-based feature
aggregation. Our framework consists of two complementary components: an
efficient latent volume that enforces geometric consistency through epipolar
constraints, and a camera-aware Transformer that leverages Pl\"ucker
coordinates for adaptive correspondence refinement. By integrating both
paradigms, our approach enhances generalization while converging 2$\times$
faster than existing methods. Furthermore, we show that spatial-aligned
foundation models (e.g., SD-VAE) substantially outperform semantic-aligned
models (e.g., DINOv2), resolving the mismatch between semantic representations
and spatial reconstruction requirements. Our method supports variable-number
and high-resolution input views while demonstrating robust cross-dataset
generalization. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, with significant PSNR
improvements of 0.59 dB, 1.06 dB, and 0.22 dB on the RealEstate10K, ACID, and

Abstract: The exponential growth in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) usage underscores
the critical need of detecting them at extended distances to ensure safe
operations, especially in densely populated areas. Despite the tremendous
advances made in computer vision through deep learning, the detection of these
small airborne objects remains a formidable challenge. While several datasets
have been developed specifically for drone detection, the need for a more
extensive and diverse collection of drone image data persists, particularly for
long-range detection under varying environmental conditions. We introduce here
the Long Range Drone Detection (LRDD) Version 2 dataset, comprising 39,516
meticulously annotated images, as a second release of the LRDD dataset released
previously. The LRDDv2 dataset enhances the LRDDv1 by incorporating a greater
variety of images, providing a more diverse and comprehensive resource for
drone detection research. What sets LRDDv2 apart is its inclusion of target
range information for over 8,000 images, making it possible to develop
algorithms for drone range estimation. Tailored for long-range aerial object
detection, the majority of LRDDv2's dataset consists of images capturing drones
with 50 or fewer pixels in 1080p resolution. For access to the complete

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集主要关注短期高分辨率图像，忽视了长期低分辨率多卫星存档的重要性，限制了全球监测的普及和鲁棒性。

Method: 通过构建Landsat30-AU数据集，包含图像-描述对和视觉问答样本，采用自举流程和人工验证确保质量。

Result: 评估显示现有模型表现不佳，但微调Qwen2.5-VL-7B后性能显著提升。

Conclusion: Landsat30-AU为卫星图像语言模型提供了重要资源，未来需进一步优化模型。

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) that enable natural language interaction with
satellite imagery can democratize Earth observation by accelerating expert
workflows, making data accessible to non-specialists, and enabling planet-scale
automation. However, existing datasets focus mainly on short-term,
high-resolution imagery from a limited number of satellites, overlooking
low-resolution, multi-satellite, long-term archives, such as Landsat, that are
essential for affordable and bias-robust global monitoring. We address this gap
with Landsat30-AU, a large-scale vision-language dataset built from 30-meter
resolution imagery collected by four Landsat satellites (5, 7, 8, and 9) over
Australia, spanning more than 36 years. The dataset includes two components:
Landsat30-AU-Cap, containing 196,262 image-caption pairs, and Landsat30-AU-VQA,
comprising 17,725 human-verified visual question answering (VQA) samples across
eight remote sensing domains. Both datasets are curated through a bootstrapped
pipeline that leverages generic VLMs with iterative refinement and human
verification to ensure quality. Our evaluation of eight VLMs on our benchmark
reveals that off-the-shelf models struggle to understand satellite imagery. The
open-source remote-sensing VLM EarthDial achieves only 0.07 SPIDEr in
captioning and a VQA accuracy of 0.48, highlighting the limitations of current
approaches. Encouragingly, lightweight fine-tuning of Qwen2.5-VL-7B on
Landsat30-AU improves captioning performance from 0.11 to 0.31 SPIDEr and
boosts VQA accuracy from \textbf{0.74} to 0.87. Code and data are available at

Abstract: We would like to estimate the pose and full shape of an object from a single
observation, without assuming known 3D model or category. In this work, we
propose OmniShape, the first method of its kind to enable probabilistic pose
and shape estimation. OmniShape is based on the key insight that shape
completion can be decoupled into two multi-modal distributions: one capturing
how measurements project into a normalized object reference frame defined by
the dataset and the other modelling a prior over object geometries represented
as triplanar neural fields. By training separate conditional diffusion models
for these two distributions, we enable sampling multiple hypotheses from the
joint pose and shape distribution. OmniShape demonstrates compelling
performance on challenging real world datasets. Project website:

Conclusion: Veila通过创新的条件扩散框架，有效解决了RGB到LiDAR生成的挑战，为自动驾驶和机器人领域的3D感知提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Realistic and controllable panoramic LiDAR data generation is critical for
scalable 3D perception in autonomous driving and robotics. Existing methods
either perform unconditional generation with poor controllability or adopt
text-guided synthesis, which lacks fine-grained spatial control. Leveraging a
monocular RGB image as a spatial control signal offers a scalable and low-cost
alternative, which remains an open problem. However, it faces three core
challenges: (i) semantic and depth cues from RGB are vary spatially,
complicating reliable conditioning generation; (ii) modality gaps between RGB
appearance and LiDAR geometry amplify alignment errors under noisy diffusion;
and (iii) maintaining structural coherence between monocular RGB and panoramic
LiDAR is challenging, particularly in non-overlap regions between images and
LiDAR. To address these challenges, we propose Veila, a novel conditional
diffusion framework that integrates: a Confidence-Aware Conditioning Mechanism
(CACM) that strengthens RGB conditioning by adaptively balancing semantic and
depth cues according to their local reliability; a Geometric Cross-Modal
Alignment (GCMA) for robust RGB-LiDAR alignment under noisy diffusion; and a
Panoramic Feature Coherence (PFC) for enforcing global structural consistency
across monocular RGB and panoramic LiDAR. Additionally, we introduce two
metrics, Cross-Modal Semantic Consistency and Cross-Modal Depth Consistency, to
evaluate alignment quality across modalities. Experiments on nuScenes,
SemanticKITTI, and our proposed KITTI-Weather benchmark demonstrate that Veila
achieves state-of-the-art generation fidelity and cross-modal consistency,
while enabling generative data augmentation that improves downstream LiDAR
semantic segmentation.

Abstract: Fire scene datasets are crucial for training robust computer vision models,
particularly in tasks such as fire early warning and emergency rescue
operations. However, among the currently available fire-related data, there is
a significant shortage of annotated data specifically targeting building
units.To tackle this issue, we introduce an annotated dataset of building units
captured by drones, which incorporates multiple enhancement techniques. We
construct backgrounds using real multi-story scenes, combine motion blur and
brightness adjustment to enhance the authenticity of the captured images,
simulate drone shooting conditions under various circumstances, and employ
large models to generate fire effects at different locations.The synthetic
dataset generated by this method encompasses a wide range of building
scenarios, with a total of 1,978 images. This dataset can effectively improve
the generalization ability of fire unit detection, providing multi-scenario and
scalable data while reducing the risks and costs associated with collecting
real fire data. The dataset is available at

Conclusion: La La LiDAR为可控3D场景生成设立了新基准。

Abstract: Controllable generation of realistic LiDAR scenes is crucial for applications
such as autonomous driving and robotics. While recent diffusion-based models
achieve high-fidelity LiDAR generation, they lack explicit control over
foreground objects and spatial relationships, limiting their usefulness for
scenario simulation and safety validation. To address these limitations, we
propose Large-scale Layout-guided LiDAR generation model ("La La LiDAR"), a
novel layout-guided generative framework that introduces semantic-enhanced
scene graph diffusion with relation-aware contextual conditioning for
structured LiDAR layout generation, followed by foreground-aware control
injection for complete scene generation. This enables customizable control over
object placement while ensuring spatial and semantic consistency. To support
our structured LiDAR generation, we introduce Waymo-SG and nuScenes-SG, two
large-scale LiDAR scene graph datasets, along with new evaluation metrics for
layout synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that La La LiDAR achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both LiDAR generation and downstream perception
tasks, establishing a new benchmark for controllable 3D scene generation.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种无需训练的框架UniEdit-I，通过理解、编辑和验证三个迭代步骤，为统一视觉语言模型（VLM）添加图像编辑能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管统一视觉语言模型在视觉理解和生成任务上取得了进展，但其图像编辑能力尚未被充分探索。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过三个步骤实现图像编辑：1) 理解步骤生成源提示和目标提示；2) 编辑步骤引入时间自适应偏移；3) 验证步骤检查对齐并提供反馈。

Result: 在GEdit-Bench基准测试中，基于BLIP3-o的实现达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: UniEdit-I框架为统一VLM提供了高效的图像编辑能力，且无需额外训练。

Abstract: In recent years, unified vision-language models (VLMs) have rapidly advanced,
effectively tackling both visual understanding and generation tasks within a
single design. While many unified VLMs have explored various design choices,
the recent hypothesis from OpenAI's GPT-4o suggests a promising generation
pipeline: Understanding VLM->Visual Feature->Projector->Diffusion Model->Image.
The understanding VLM is frozen, and only the generation-related modules are
trained. This pipeline maintains the strong capability of understanding VLM
while enabling the image generation ability of the unified VLM. Although this
pipeline has shown very promising potential for the future development of
unified VLM, how to easily enable image editing capability is still unexplored.
In this paper, we introduce a novel training-free framework named UniEdit-I to
enable the unified VLM with image editing capability via three iterative steps:
understanding, editing, and verifying. 1. The understanding step analyzes the
source image to create a source prompt through structured semantic analysis and
makes minimal word replacements to form the target prompt based on the editing
instruction. 2. The editing step introduces a time-adaptive offset, allowing
for coherent editing from coarse to fine throughout the denoising process. 3.
The verification step checks the alignment between the target prompt and the
intermediate edited image, provides automatic consistency scores and corrective
feedback, and determines whether to stop early or continue the editing loop.
This understanding, editing, and verifying loop iterates until convergence,
delivering high-fidelity editing in a training-free manner. We implemented our
method based on the latest BLIP3-o and achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA)
performance on the GEdit-Bench benchmark.

Conclusion: LiDARCrafter为数据增强和仿真提供了新途径，代码和基准已开源。

Abstract: Generative world models have become essential data engines for autonomous
driving, yet most existing efforts focus on videos or occupancy grids,
overlooking the unique LiDAR properties. Extending LiDAR generation to dynamic
4D world modeling presents challenges in controllability, temporal coherence,
and evaluation standardization. To this end, we present LiDARCrafter, a unified
framework for 4D LiDAR generation and editing. Given free-form natural language
inputs, we parse instructions into ego-centric scene graphs, which condition a
tri-branch diffusion network to generate object structures, motion
trajectories, and geometry. These structured conditions enable diverse and
fine-grained scene editing. Additionally, an autoregressive module generates
temporally coherent 4D LiDAR sequences with smooth transitions. To support
standardized evaluation, we establish a comprehensive benchmark with diverse
metrics spanning scene-, object-, and sequence-level aspects. Experiments on
the nuScenes dataset using this benchmark demonstrate that LiDARCrafter
achieves state-of-the-art performance in fidelity, controllability, and
temporal consistency across all levels, paving the way for data augmentation
and simulation. The code and benchmark are released to the community.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散方法在空间可控性和区域保真度上表现不足，需要一种更精确的异常合成方法。

Method: 提出SARD框架，结合区域约束扩散（RCD）和判别性掩码引导（DMG），选择性更新异常区域并评估全局和局部保真度。

Result: 在MVTec-AD和BTAD数据集上，SARD在分割精度和视觉质量上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SARD为像素级异常合成设定了新的技术标杆。

Abstract: Synthesizing realistic and spatially precise anomalies is essential for
enhancing the robustness of industrial anomaly detection systems. While recent
diffusion-based methods have demonstrated strong capabilities in modeling
complex defect patterns, they often struggle with spatial controllability and
fail to maintain fine-grained regional fidelity. To overcome these limitations,
we propose SARD (Segmentation-Aware anomaly synthesis via Region-constrained
Diffusion with discriminative mask Guidance), a novel diffusion-based framework
specifically designed for anomaly generation. Our approach introduces a
Region-Constrained Diffusion (RCD) process that preserves the background by
freezing it and selectively updating only the foreground anomaly regions during
the reverse denoising phase, thereby effectively reducing background artifacts.
Additionally, we incorporate a Discriminative Mask Guidance (DMG) module into
the discriminator, enabling joint evaluation of both global realism and local
anomaly fidelity, guided by pixel-level masks. Extensive experiments on the
MVTec-AD and BTAD datasets show that SARD surpasses existing methods in
segmentation accuracy and visual quality, setting a new state-of-the-art for
pixel-level anomaly synthesis.

Result: 在PIEBench、SmartEdit和GapEdit三个基准测试中，LORE在语义对齐、图像质量和背景保真度上显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: LORE通过潜在空间优化，为通用图像编辑提供了有效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Text-driven image editing enables users to flexibly modify visual content
through natural language instructions, and is widely applied to tasks such as
semantic object replacement, insertion, and removal. While recent
inversion-based editing methods using rectified flow models have achieved
promising results in image quality, we identify a structural limitation in
their editing behavior: the semantic bias toward the source concept encoded in
the inverted noise tends to suppress attention to the target concept. This
issue becomes particularly critical when the source and target semantics are
dissimilar, where the attention mechanism inherently leads to editing failure
or unintended modifications in non-target regions. In this paper, we
systematically analyze and validate this structural flaw, and introduce LORE, a
training-free and efficient image editing method. LORE directly optimizes the
inverted noise, addressing the core limitations in generalization and
controllability of existing approaches, enabling stable, controllable, and
general-purpose concept replacement, without requiring architectural
modification or model fine-tuning. We conduct comprehensive evaluations on
three challenging benchmarks: PIEBench, SmartEdit, and GapEdit. Experimental
results show that LORE significantly outperforms strong baselines in terms of
semantic alignment, image quality, and background fidelity, demonstrating the
effectiveness and scalability of latent-space optimization for general-purpose
image editing.

Motivation: 现有图表数据集存在无关信息和结构捕捉不足的问题，导致视觉语言模型生成标题时容易产生幻觉。

Method: 设计四阶段流程生成仅基于图表可辨识数据的标题，采用循环一致性验证加速质量控制，并提出视觉一致性评分评估标题质量。

Result: 实验证明，基于ChartCap微调的模型生成的标题更准确、信息丰富，且幻觉减少，优于开源、专有模型及人工标注标题。

Conclusion: ChartCap通过高质量数据集和验证方法，显著提升了图表标题生成的准确性和信息量。

Abstract: Generating accurate, informative, and hallucination-free captions for charts
remains challenging for vision language models, primarily due to the lack of
large-scale, high-quality datasets of real-world charts. However, existing
real-world chart datasets suffer from the inclusion of extraneous information
that cannot be inferred from the chart and failure to sufficiently capture
structural elements and key insights. Therefore, we introduce ChartCap, a
large-scale dataset of 565K real-world chart images paired with type-specific,
dense captions that exclude extraneous information and highlight both
structural elements and key insights in detail. To build ChartCap, we design a
four-stage pipeline that generates captions using only the discernible data
from the chart and employ a cycle consistency-based human verification, which
accelerates quality control without sacrificing accuracy. Additionally, we
propose a novel metric, the Visual Consistency Score, which evaluates caption
quality by measuring the similarity between the chart regenerated from a
caption and the original chart, independent of reference captions. Extensive
experiments confirms that models fine-tuned on ChartCap consistently generate
more accurate and informative captions with reduced hallucinations, surpassing
both open-source and proprietary models and even human-annotated captions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管现有方法能减少摄影图像中的幻觉，但风格化图像在关键场景（如游戏、艺术教育、医疗）中的潜在风险被忽视。

Method: 构建包含摄影图像和风格化版本的数据集，提出SAVER机制，通过动态调整视觉注意力模式减少幻觉。

Result: 实验表明，风格化图像比摄影图像更易引发幻觉，SAVER在多种任务中表现最优。

Conclusion: SAVER有效解决了风格化图像引发的幻觉问题，提升了LVLMs的实用性。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) recently achieve significant
breakthroughs in understanding complex visual-textual contexts. However,
hallucination issues still limit their real-world applicability. Although
previous mitigation methods effectively reduce hallucinations in photographic
images, they largely overlook the potential risks posed by stylized images,
which play crucial roles in critical scenarios such as game scene
understanding, art education, and medical analysis. In this work, we first
construct a dataset comprising photographic images and their corresponding
stylized versions with carefully annotated caption labels. We then conduct
head-to-head comparisons on both discriminative and generative tasks by
benchmarking 13 advanced LVLMs on the collected datasets. Our findings reveal
that stylized images tend to induce significantly more hallucinations than
their photographic counterparts. To address this issue, we propose Style-Aware
Visual Early Revision SAVER, a novel mechanism that dynamically adjusts LVLMs'
final outputs based on the token-level visual attention patterns, leveraging
early-layer feedback to mitigate hallucinations caused by stylized images.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that SAVER achieves state-of-the-art
performance in hallucination mitigation across various models, datasets, and
tasks.

Motivation: 现有3D高斯渲染方法依赖计算密集的顺序alpha混合操作，导致资源受限平台性能瓶颈。

Method: 引入双层次框架，结合代理高斯表示与顺序无关渲染技术，采用单元代理管理和单元搜索光栅化加速。

Result: 实验显示，方法在多样场景中表现鲁棒，渲染质量高，速度提升1.5至4倍，排序开销减少52.2%至86.9%。

Conclusion: Duplex-GS框架显著提升高斯渲染效率和质量，验证了顺序无关渲染技术的优势。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have demonstrated remarkable
rendering fidelity and efficiency. However, these methods still rely on
computationally expensive sequential alpha-blending operations, resulting in
significant overhead, particularly on resource-constrained platforms. In this
paper, we propose Duplex-GS, a dual-hierarchy framework that integrates proxy
Gaussian representations with order-independent rendering techniques to achieve
photorealistic results while sustaining real-time performance. To mitigate the
overhead caused by view-adaptive radix sort, we introduce cell proxies for
local Gaussians management and propose cell search rasterization for further
acceleration. By seamlessly combining our framework with Order-Independent
Transparency (OIT), we develop a physically inspired weighted sum rendering
technique that simultaneously eliminates "popping" and "transparency"
artifacts, yielding substantial improvements in both accuracy and efficiency.
Extensive experiments on a variety of real-world datasets demonstrate the
robustness of our method across diverse scenarios, including multi-scale
training views and large-scale environments. Our results validate the
advantages of the OIT rendering paradigm in Gaussian Splatting, achieving
high-quality rendering with an impressive 1.5 to 4 speedup over existing OIT
based Gaussian Splatting approaches and 52.2% to 86.9% reduction of the radix
sort overhead without quality degradation.

Result: 在NYU-V2和KITTI数据集上表现优异，超越现有方法。

Conclusion: 提出的模块有效提升了深度估计的准确性。

Abstract: Accurate monocular depth estimation remains a challenging problem due to the
inherent ambiguity that stems from the ill-posed nature of recovering 3D
structure from a single view, where multiple plausible depth configurations can
produce identical 2D projections. In this paper, we present a novel depth
estimation method that combines both local and global cues to improve
prediction accuracy. Specifically, we propose the Gated Large Kernel Attention
Module (GLKAM) to effectively capture multi-scale local structural information
by leveraging large kernel convolutions with a gated mechanism. To further
enhance the global perception of the network, we introduce the Global Bin
Prediction Module (GBPM), which estimates the global distribution of depth bins
and provides structural guidance for depth regression. Extensive experiments on
the NYU-V2 and KITTI dataset demonstrate that our method achieves competitive
performance and outperforms existing approaches, validating the effectiveness
of each proposed component.

Motivation: 人脸伪造技术的快速发展要求检测器持续适应新方法，但现有方法在学习新伪造类型时会导致对旧类型的性能快速下降（灾难性遗忘）。KAN因其局部可塑性适合解决这一问题，但在高维图像建模和特征重叠时存在局限性。

Method: 提出KAN-CFD框架，包括域组KAN检测器（DG-KD）和无数据回放特征分离策略（FS-KDCP）。DG-KD使KAN适应高维图像输入并保留局部可塑性；FS-KDCP避免输入空间重叠。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在减少遗忘的同时实现了优越的性能。

Conclusion: KAN-CFD框架有效解决了KAN在持续人脸伪造检测中的局限性，显著提升了检测器的适应能力和抗遗忘性能。

Abstract: The rapid advancements in face forgery techniques necessitate that detectors
continuously adapt to new forgery methods, thus situating face forgery
detection within a continual learning paradigm. However, when detectors learn
new forgery types, their performance on previous types often degrades rapidly,
a phenomenon known as catastrophic forgetting. Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks
(KANs) utilize locally plastic splines as their activation functions, enabling
them to learn new tasks by modifying only local regions of the functions while
leaving other areas unaffected. Therefore, they are naturally suitable for
addressing catastrophic forgetting. However, KANs have two significant
limitations: 1) the splines are ineffective for modeling high-dimensional
images, while alternative activation functions that are suitable for images
lack the essential property of locality; 2) in continual learning, when
features from different domains overlap, the mapping of different domains to
distinct curve regions always collapses due to repeated modifications of the
same regions. In this paper, we propose a KAN-based Continual Face Forgery
Detection (KAN-CFD) framework, which includes a Domain-Group KAN Detector
(DG-KD) and a data-free replay Feature Separation strategy via KAN Drift
Compensation Projection (FS-KDCP). DG-KD enables KANs to fit high-dimensional
image inputs while preserving locality and local plasticity. FS-KDCP avoids the
overlap of the KAN input spaces without using data from prior tasks.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior
performance while notably reducing forgetting.

Motivation: CNV是湿性年龄相关性黄斑变性的主要特征，准确分割OCTA图像中的CNV对临床评估至关重要，但现有方法受限于不规则形状和成像问题。

Conclusion: MTG-Net通过图机制和多任务框架有效解决了CNV分割的挑战，为临床提供了更准确的工具。

Abstract: Choroidal neovascularization (CNV), a primary characteristic of wet
age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD), represents a leading cause of
blindness worldwide. In clinical practice, optical coherence tomography
angiography (OCTA) is commonly used for studying CNV-related pathological
changes, due to its micron-level resolution and non-invasive nature. Thus,
accurate segmentation of CNV regions and vessels in OCTA images is crucial for
clinical assessment of wet AMD. However, challenges existed due to irregular
CNV shapes and imaging limitations like projection artifacts, noises and
boundary blurring. Moreover, the lack of publicly available datasets
constraints the CNV analysis. To address these challenges, this paper
constructs the first publicly accessible CNV dataset (CNVSeg), and proposes a
novel multilateral graph convolutional interaction-enhanced CNV segmentation
network (MTG-Net). This network integrates both region and vessel morphological
information, exploring semantic and geometric duality constraints within the
graph domain. Specifically, MTG-Net consists of a multi-task framework and two
graph-based cross-task modules: Multilateral Interaction Graph Reasoning (MIGR)
and Multilateral Reinforcement Graph Reasoning (MRGR). The multi-task framework
encodes rich geometric features of lesion shapes and surfaces, decoupling the
image into three task-specific feature maps. MIGR and MRGR iteratively reason
about higher-order relationships across tasks through a graph mechanism,
enabling complementary optimization for task-specific objectives. Additionally,
an uncertainty-weighted loss is proposed to mitigate the impact of artifacts
and noise on segmentation accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that
MTG-Net outperforms existing methods, achieving a Dice socre of 87.21\% for
region segmentation and 88.12\% for vessel segmentation.

Conclusion: AlignCAT通过充分利用语言线索，逐步过滤未对齐的视觉查询，提升了对比学习效率，解决了VG中的语义模糊问题。

Abstract: Weakly supervised visual grounding (VG) aims to locate objects in images
based on text descriptions. Despite significant progress, existing methods lack
strong cross-modal reasoning to distinguish subtle semantic differences in text
expressions due to category-based and attribute-based ambiguity. To address
these challenges, we introduce AlignCAT, a novel query-based semantic matching
framework for weakly supervised VG. To enhance visual-linguistic alignment, we
propose a coarse-grained alignment module that utilizes category information
and global context, effectively mitigating interference from
category-inconsistent objects. Subsequently, a fine-grained alignment module
leverages descriptive information and captures word-level text features to
achieve attribute consistency. By exploiting linguistic cues to their fullest
extent, our proposed AlignCAT progressively filters out misaligned visual
queries and enhances contrastive learning efficiency. Extensive experiments on
three VG benchmarks, namely RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, and RefCOCOg, verify the
superiority of AlignCAT against existing weakly supervised methods on two VG
tasks. Our code is available at: https://github.com/I2-Multimedia-Lab/AlignCAT.

Result: 在SWIG-HOI和HICO-DET数据集上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: INP-CC通过动态提示和概念校准有效提升开放词汇HOI检测性能。

Abstract: Open Vocabulary Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection aims to detect
interactions between humans and objects while generalizing to novel interaction
classes beyond the training set. Current methods often rely on Vision and
Language Models (VLMs) but face challenges due to suboptimal image encoders, as
image-level pre-training does not align well with the fine-grained region-level
interaction detection required for HOI. Additionally, effectively encoding
textual descriptions of visual appearances remains difficult, limiting the
model's ability to capture detailed HOI relationships. To address these issues,
we propose INteraction-aware Prompting with Concept Calibration (INP-CC), an
end-to-end open-vocabulary HOI detector that integrates interaction-aware
prompts and concept calibration. Specifically, we propose an interaction-aware
prompt generator that dynamically generates a compact set of prompts based on
the input scene, enabling selective sharing among similar interactions. This
approach directs the model's attention to key interaction patterns rather than
generic image-level semantics, enhancing HOI detection. Furthermore, we refine
HOI concept representations through language model-guided calibration, which
helps distinguish diverse HOI concepts by investigating visual similarities

inter-modal similarity modeling, enabling the model to better differentiate
visually similar but semantically distinct actions. Extensive experimental

### [59] [GeoShield: Safeguarding Geolocation Privacy from Vision-Language Models via Adversarial Perturbations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03209)
*Xinwei Liu,Xiaojun Jia,Yuan Xun,Simeng Qin,Xiaochun Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoShield是一种新型对抗框架，用于保护地理隐私，通过特征解耦、曝光元素识别和尺度自适应增强模块，有效防御高级视觉语言模型（如GPT-4o）的地理位置推断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗扰动方法在高分辨率图像和低扰动预算下表现不佳，且可能引入无关语义内容，无法有效保护地理隐私。

Method: GeoShield包含三个模块：特征解耦模块分离地理和非地理信息，曝光元素识别模块定位图像中地理暴露区域，尺度自适应增强模块联合优化全局和局部扰动。

Result: 在挑战性基准测试中，GeoShield在黑盒设置下优于现有方法，提供强隐私保护且对视觉或语义质量影响最小。

Conclusion: GeoShield是首个探索对抗扰动防御高级VLM地理推断的研究，为日益增长的隐私问题提供了实用有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as GPT-4o now demonstrate a remarkable
ability to infer users' locations from public shared images, posing a
substantial risk to geoprivacy. Although adversarial perturbations offer a
potential defense, current methods are ill-suited for this scenario: they often
perform poorly on high-resolution images and low perturbation budgets, and may
introduce irrelevant semantic content. To address these limitations, we propose
GeoShield, a novel adversarial framework designed for robust geoprivacy
protection in real-world scenarios. GeoShield comprises three key modules: a
feature disentanglement module that separates geographical and non-geographical
information, an exposure element identification module that pinpoints
geo-revealing regions within an image, and a scale-adaptive enhancement module
that jointly optimizes perturbations at both global and local levels to ensure
effectiveness across resolutions. Extensive experiments on challenging
benchmarks show that GeoShield consistently surpasses prior methods in
black-box settings, achieving strong privacy protection with minimal impact on
visual or semantic quality. To our knowledge, this work is the first to explore
adversarial perturbations for defending against geolocation inference by
advanced VLMs, providing a practical and effective solution to escalating
privacy concerns.

Motivation: 对抗扰动对深度学习模型构成威胁，现有对抗训练方法计算成本高且影响标准性能，需开发高效且鲁棒的防御机制。

Method: 提出UAA框架，通过离线预计算通用变换，在训练时高效生成对抗扰动，避免在线生成的高成本。

Result: UAA在多个基准测试中表现优异，成为数据增强对抗防御的新SOTA。

Conclusion: UAA为构建鲁棒模型提供了高效实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Adversarial perturbations pose a significant threat to deep learning models.
Adversarial Training (AT), the predominant defense method, faces challenges of
high computational costs and a degradation in standard performance. While data
augmentation offers an alternative path, existing techniques either yield
limited robustness gains or incur substantial training overhead. Therefore,
developing a defense mechanism that is both highly efficient and strongly
robust is of paramount importance.In this work, we first conduct a systematic
analysis of existing augmentation techniques, revealing that the synergy among
diverse strategies -- rather than any single method -- is crucial for enhancing
robustness. Based on this insight, we propose the Universal Adversarial
Augmenter (UAA) framework, which is characterized by its plug-and-play nature
and training efficiency. UAA decouples the expensive perturbation generation
process from model training by pre-computing a universal transformation
offline, which is then used to efficiently generate unique adversarial
perturbations for each sample during training.Extensive experiments conducted
on multiple benchmarks validate the effectiveness of UAA. The results
demonstrate that UAA establishes a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) for
data-augmentation-based adversarial defense strategies , without requiring the
online generation of adversarial examples during training. This framework
provides a practical and efficient pathway for building robust models,Our code

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为ActionSink的新型机器人操作框架，通过自监督方式将机器人动作重新定义为视频中的光流（称为“动作流”），并利用检索和整合技术提升动作估计的精确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于学习的机器人操作中，低层动作估计的低精度是性能的主要限制因素，因此需要一种新方法来提升动作估计的精确性。

Method: ActionSink包含两个主要模块：1）粗到细的动作流匹配器，通过迭代检索和去噪过程提升动作流精度；2）动态动作流整合器，利用工作记忆池动态管理历史动作流，并通过多层融合模块整合当前和历史的动作流。

Result: 在LIBERO基准测试中，ActionSink比之前的最佳方法提升了7.9%的成功率，在LIBERO-Long任务中获得了近8%的准确率提升。

Conclusion: ActionSink通过自监督的动作流和动态整合技术，显著提升了机器人动作估计的精确性，为学习型机器人操作提供了新方向。

Abstract: Language-instructed robot manipulation has garnered significant interest due
to the potential of learning from collected data. While the challenges in
high-level perception and planning are continually addressed along the progress
of general large pre-trained models, the low precision of low-level action
estimation has emerged as the key limiting factor in manipulation performance.
To this end, this paper introduces a novel robot manipulation framework, i.e.,
ActionSink, to pave the way toward precise action estimations in the field of
learning-based robot manipulation. As the name suggests, ActionSink
reformulates the actions of robots as action-caused optical flows from videos,
called "action flow", in a self-supervised manner, which are then used to be
retrieved and integrated to enhance the action estimation. Specifically,
ActionSink incorporates two primary modules. The first module is a
coarse-to-fine action flow matcher, which continuously refines the accuracy of
action flow via iterative retrieval and denoising process. The second module is
a dynamic action flow integrator, which employs a working memory pool that
dynamically and efficiently manages the historical action flows that should be
used to integrate to enhance the current action estimation. In this module, a
multi-layer fusion module is proposed to integrate direct estimation and action
flows from both the current and the working memory, achieving highly accurate
action estimation through a series of estimation-integration processes. Our
ActionSink framework outperformed prior SOTA on the LIBERO benchmark by a 7.9\%
success rate, and obtained nearly an 8\% accuracy gain on the challenging
long-horizon visual task LIBERO-Long.

TL;DR: 提出Gaussian Instance Tracing (GIT)方法，通过引入实例权重矩阵和自适应密度控制，解决2D到3D分割中的不一致性问题，提升分割边界清晰度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在2D到3D分割中存在视角间不一致和边界噪声问题，忽视语义线索对高斯学习的优化作用。

Method: GIT扩展高斯表示，加入跨视图实例权重矩阵，利用3D高斯一致性修正2D分割不一致性，并通过自适应密度控制机制优化高斯分布。

Result: 实验表明，GIT能提取干净的3D资产，并在在线和离线场景中一致提升3D分割效果。

Conclusion: GIT方法显著改善了分割边界质量，支持分层分割、对象提取和场景编辑等应用。

Abstract: We address the challenge of lifting 2D visual segmentation to 3D in Gaussian
Splatting. Existing methods often suffer from inconsistent 2D masks across
viewpoints and produce noisy segmentation boundaries as they neglect these
semantic cues to refine the learned Gaussians. To overcome this, we introduce
Gaussian Instance Tracing (GIT), which augments the standard Gaussian
representation with an instance weight matrix across input views. Leveraging
the inherent consistency of Gaussians in 3D, we use this matrix to identify and
correct 2D segmentation inconsistencies. Furthermore, since each Gaussian
ideally corresponds to a single object, we propose a GIT-guided adaptive
density control mechanism to split and prune ambiguous Gaussians during
training, resulting in sharper and more coherent 2D and 3D segmentation
boundaries. Experimental results show that our method extracts clean 3D assets
and consistently improves 3D segmentation in both online (e.g., self-prompting)
and offline (e.g., contrastive lifting) settings, enabling applications such as
hierarchical segmentation, object extraction, and scene editing.

Motivation: 传统深度学习方法需要大量标注数据和计算资源，限制了纳米颗粒研究的可及性。

Method: 结合SAM进行对象分割和DINOv2进行特征嵌入，使用轻量级分类器实现高精度分类。

Abstract: Accurate and efficient characterization of nanoparticle morphology in
Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) images is critical for ensuring product
quality in nanomaterial synthesis and accelerating development. However,
conventional deep learning methods for shape classification require extensive
labeled datasets and computationally demanding training, limiting their
accessibility to the typical nanoparticle practitioner in research and
industrial settings. In this study, we introduce a zero-shot classification
pipeline that leverages two vision foundation models: the Segment Anything
Model (SAM) for object segmentation and DINOv2 for feature embedding. By
combining these models with a lightweight classifier, we achieve high-precision
shape classification across three morphologically diverse nanoparticle datasets
- without the need for extensive parameter fine-tuning. Our methodology
outperforms a fine-tuned YOLOv11 and ChatGPT o4-mini-high baselines,
demonstrating robustness to small datasets, subtle morphological variations,
and domain shifts from natural to scientific imaging. Quantitative clustering
metrics on PCA plots of the DINOv2 features are discussed as a means of
assessing the progress of the chemical synthesis. This work highlights the
potential of foundation models to advance automated microscopy image analysis,
offering an alternative to traditional deep learning pipelines in nanoparticle
research which is both more efficient and more accessible to the user.

TL;DR: FFHQ-Makeup是一个高质量合成化妆数据集，解决了现有数据集在真实性和一致性上的不足，为美容相关任务提供了重要资源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有化妆数据集在真实性和一致性上存在不足，难以满足美容相关任务的需求。

Method: 基于FFHQ数据集，通过改进的化妆转移方法生成18K身份的90K高质量化妆-素颜配对图像。

Result: 构建了首个专注于化妆的数据集FFHQ-Makeup，包含90K高质量配对图像。

Conclusion: FFHQ-Makeup填补了高质量化妆数据集的空白，为未来研究提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Paired bare-makeup facial images are essential for a wide range of
beauty-related tasks, such as virtual try-on, facial privacy protection, and
facial aesthetics analysis. However, collecting high-quality paired makeup
datasets remains a significant challenge. Real-world data acquisition is
constrained by the difficulty of collecting large-scale paired images, while
existing synthetic approaches often suffer from limited realism or
inconsistencies between bare and makeup images. Current synthetic methods
typically fall into two categories: warping-based transformations, which often
distort facial geometry and compromise the precision of makeup; and
text-to-image generation, which tends to alter facial identity and expression,
undermining consistency. In this work, we present FFHQ-Makeup, a high-quality
synthetic makeup dataset that pairs each identity with multiple makeup styles
while preserving facial consistency in both identity and expression. Built upon
the diverse FFHQ dataset, our pipeline transfers real-world makeup styles from
existing datasets onto 18K identities by introducing an improved makeup
transfer method that disentangles identity and makeup. Each identity is paired
with 5 different makeup styles, resulting in a total of 90K high-quality
bare-makeup image pairs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work
that focuses specifically on constructing a makeup dataset. We hope that
FFHQ-Makeup fills the gap of lacking high-quality bare-makeup paired datasets
and serves as a valuable resource for future research in beauty-related tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单视角或多视角后处理无法解决的姿态模糊问题，提出一种更可靠的多视角方法。

Method: 通过视线建模多视角几何，融合多视角信息进行姿态估计，无需额外数据（如深度）。

Result: 在合成数据集上优于单视角和其他多视角方法，在YCB-V数据集上表现竞争性。

Conclusion: MVTOP是一种端到端可训练的可靠多视角姿态估计方法，无需额外数据。

Abstract: We present MVTOP, a novel transformer-based method for multi-view rigid
object pose estimation. Through an early fusion of the view-specific features,
our method can resolve pose ambiguities that would be impossible to solve with
a single view or with a post-processing of single-view poses. MVTOP models the
multi-view geometry via lines of sight that emanate from the respective camera
centers. While the method assumes the camera interior and relative orientations
are known for a particular scene, they can vary for each inference. This makes
the method versatile. The use of the lines of sight enables MVTOP to correctly
predict the correct pose with the merged multi-view information. To show the
model's capabilities, we provide a synthetic data set that can only be solved
with such holistic multi-view approaches since the poses in the dataset cannot
be solved with just one view. Our method outperforms single-view and all
existing multi-view approaches on our dataset and achieves competitive results
on the YCB-V dataset. To the best of our knowledge, no holistic multi-view
method exists that can resolve such pose ambiguities reliably. Our model is
end-to-end trainable and does not require any additional data, e.g., depth.

Abstract: Event cameras offer unparalleled advantages such as high temporal resolution,
low latency, and high dynamic range. However, their limited spatial resolution
poses challenges for fine-grained perception tasks. In this work, we propose an
ultra-lightweight, stream-based event-to-event super-resolution method based on
Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), designed for real-time deployment on
resource-constrained devices. To further reduce model size, we introduce a
novel Dual-Forward Polarity-Split Event Encoding strategy that decouples
positive and negative events into separate forward paths through a shared SNN.
Furthermore, we propose a Learnable Spatio-temporal Polarity-aware Loss
(LearnSTPLoss) that adaptively balances temporal, spatial, and polarity
consistency using learnable uncertainty-based weights. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method achieves competitive super-resolution performance
on multiple datasets while significantly reducing model size and inference
time. The lightweight design enables embedding the module into event cameras or
using it as an efficient front-end preprocessing for downstream vision tasks.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖多步迭代推理，效率低，且对多级扰动的鲁棒性不足。

Result: 在公开基准测试中，RSDNet表现优于现有方法，达到最先进的检测性能。

Conclusion: RSDNet通过单步推理和多级噪声处理，实现了高效且鲁棒的3D物体检测。

Abstract: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) have shown success in robust
3D object detection tasks. Existing methods often rely on the score matching
from 3D boxes or pre-trained diffusion priors. However, they typically require
multi-step iterations in inference, which limits efficiency. To address this,
we propose a \textbf{R}obust single-stage fully \textbf{S}parse 3D object
\textbf{D}etection \textbf{Net}work with a Detachable Latent Framework (DLF) of
DDPMs, named RSDNet. Specifically, RSDNet learns the denoising process in
latent feature spaces through lightweight denoising networks like multi-level
denoising autoencoders (DAEs). This enables RSDNet to effectively understand
scene distributions under multi-level perturbations, achieving robust and
reliable detection. Meanwhile, we reformulate the noising and denoising
mechanisms of DDPMs, enabling DLF to construct multi-type and multi-level noise
samples and targets, enhancing RSDNet robustness to multiple perturbations.
Furthermore, a semantic-geometric conditional guidance is introduced to
perceive the object boundaries and shapes, alleviating the center feature
missing problem in sparse representations, enabling RSDNet to perform in a
fully sparse detection pipeline. Moreover, the detachable denoising network
design of DLF enables RSDNet to perform single-step detection in inference,
further enhancing detection efficiency. Extensive experiments on public
benchmarks show that RSDNet can outperform existing methods, achieving
state-of-the-art detection.

Conclusion: ReDPO和V.I.P.框架能高效生成高质量视频，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: With growing interest in deploying text-to-video (T2V) models in
resource-constrained environments, reducing their high computational cost has
become crucial, leading to extensive research on pruning and knowledge
distillation methods while maintaining performance. However, existing
distillation methods primarily rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which
often leads to mode collapse as pruned models with reduced capacity fail to
directly match the teacher's outputs, ultimately resulting in degraded quality.
To address this challenge, we propose an effective distillation method, ReDPO,
that integrates DPO and SFT. Our approach leverages DPO to guide the student
model to focus on recovering only the targeted properties, rather than
passively imitating the teacher, while also utilizing SFT to enhance overall
performance. We additionally propose V.I.P., a novel framework for filtering
and curating high-quality pair datasets, along with a step-by-step online
approach for calibrated training. We validate our method on two leading T2V
models, VideoCrafter2 and AnimateDiff, achieving parameter reduction of 36.2%
and 67.5% each, while maintaining or even surpassing the performance of full
models. Further experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of both ReDPO and
V.I.P. framework in enabling efficient and high-quality video generation. Our

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有手写文本生成方法主要关注孤立单词，而真实手写文本需要关注单词间关系（如垂直对齐和水平间距），因此生成整行文本更具挑战性和实用性。

Method: DiffBrush采用内容解耦风格学习（通过列和行掩码分离风格与内容）和多尺度内容学习（使用行和单词判别器确保全局连贯性和局部准确性）。

Result: 实验表明，DiffBrush在生成高质量文本行方面表现优异，尤其在风格再现和内容保留方面。

Conclusion: DiffBrush通过创新方法解决了手写文本行生成的复杂问题，为相关领域提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Existing handwritten text generation methods primarily focus on isolated
words. However, realistic handwritten text demands attention not only to
individual words but also to the relationships between them, such as vertical
alignment and horizontal spacing. Therefore, generating entire text lines
emerges as a more promising and comprehensive task. However, this task poses
significant challenges, including the accurate modeling of complex style
patterns encompassing both intra- and inter-word relationships, and maintaining
content accuracy across numerous characters. To address these challenges, we
propose DiffBrush, a novel diffusion-based model for handwritten text-line
generation. Unlike existing methods, DiffBrush excels in both style imitation
and content accuracy through two key strategies: (1) content-decoupled style
learning, which disentangles style from content to better capture intra-word
and inter-word style patterns by using column- and row-wise masking; and (2)
multi-scale content learning, which employs line and word discriminators to
ensure global coherence and local accuracy of textual content. Extensive
experiments show that DiffBrush excels in generating high-quality text lines,
particularly in style reproduction and content preservation. Code is available

Conclusion: EgoPrompt通过增强组件间交互和优化提示池，显著提升了第一人称动作识别的表现。

Abstract: Driven by the increasing demand for applications in augmented and virtual
reality, egocentric action recognition has emerged as a prominent research
area. It is typically divided into two subtasks: recognizing the performed
behavior (i.e., verb component) and identifying the objects being acted upon
(i.e., noun component) from the first-person perspective. However, most
existing approaches treat these two components as independent classification
tasks, focusing on extracting component-specific knowledge while overlooking
their inherent semantic and contextual relationships, leading to fragmented
representations and sub-optimal generalization capability. To address these
challenges, we propose a prompt learning-based framework, EgoPrompt, to conduct
the egocentric action recognition task. Building on the existing prompting
strategy to capture the component-specific knowledge, we construct a Unified
Prompt Pool space to establish interaction between the two types of component
representations. Specifically, the component representations (from verbs and
nouns) are first decomposed into fine-grained patterns with the prompt pair
form. Then, these pattern-level representations are fused through an
attention-based mechanism to facilitate cross-component interaction. To ensure
the prompt pool is informative, we further introduce a novel training
objective, Diverse Pool Criteria. This objective realizes our goals from two
perspectives: Prompt Selection Frequency Regularization and Prompt Knowledge
Orthogonalization. Extensive experiments are conducted on the Ego4D,
EPIC-Kitchens, and EGTEA datasets. The results consistently show that EgoPrompt
achieves state-of-the-art performance across within-dataset, cross-dataset, and
base-to-novel generalization benchmarks.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of placental diseases via whole slide images (WSIs) is
critical for preventing severe maternal and fetal complications. However, WSI
analysis presents significant computational challenges due to the massive data
volume. Existing WSI classification methods encounter critical limitations: (1)
inadequate patch selection strategies that either compromise performance or
fail to sufficiently reduce computational demands, and (2) the loss of global
histological context resulting from patch-level processing approaches. To
address these challenges, we propose an Efficient multimodal framework for
Patient-level placental disease Diagnosis, named EmmPD. Our approach introduces
a two-stage patch selection module that combines parameter-free and learnable
compression strategies, optimally balancing computational efficiency with
critical feature preservation. Additionally, we develop a hybrid multimodal
fusion module that leverages adaptive graph learning to enhance pathological
feature representation and incorporates textual medical reports to enrich
global contextual understanding. Extensive experiments conducted on both a
self-constructed patient-level Placental dataset and two public datasets
demonstrating that our method achieves state-of-the-art diagnostic performance.

Abstract: Deep learning-based semantic segmentation models achieve impressive results
yet remain limited in handling distribution shifts between training and test
data. In this paper, we present SDGPA (Synthetic Data Generation and
Progressive Adaptation), a novel method that tackles zero-shot domain adaptive
semantic segmentation, in which no target images are available, but only a text
description of the target domain's style is provided. To compensate for the
lack of target domain training data, we utilize a pretrained off-the-shelf
text-to-image diffusion model, which generates training images by transferring
source domain images to target style. Directly editing source domain images
introduces noise that harms segmentation because the layout of source images
cannot be precisely maintained. To address inaccurate layouts in synthetic
data, we propose a method that crops the source image, edits small patches
individually, and then merges them back together, which helps improve spatial
precision. Recognizing the large domain gap, SDGPA constructs an augmented
intermediate domain, leveraging easier adaptation subtasks to enable more
stable model adaptation to the target domain. Additionally, to mitigate the
impact of noise in synthetic data, we design a progressive adaptation strategy,
ensuring robust learning throughout the training process. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot
semantic segmentation. The code is available at

*Libo Zhang,Xinyu Yi,Feng Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BaroPoser结合IMU和气压计数据，实时估计人体姿态和全局位移，提升非平坦地形下的运动捕捉精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法因传感器数据稀疏和缺乏非平坦地形数据集，姿态估计精度受限，仅适用于平坦地形。

Method: 结合智能手机和智能手表的IMU与气压数据，利用气压读数估计高度变化，提出局部大腿坐标系以分离局部和全局运动。

Result: 在公开基准数据集和真实世界记录中，BaroPoser性能优于仅使用IMU的现有方法。

Conclusion: BaroPoser通过融合气压数据显著提升了非平坦地形下的运动捕捉精度，优于现有技术。

Abstract: In recent years, tracking human motion using IMUs from everyday devices such
as smartphones and smartwatches has gained increasing popularity. However, due
to the sparsity of sensor measurements and the lack of datasets capturing human
motion over uneven terrain, existing methods often struggle with pose
estimation accuracy and are typically limited to recovering movements on flat
terrain only. To this end, we present BaroPoser, the first method that combines
IMU and barometric data recorded by a smartphone and a smartwatch to estimate
human pose and global translation in real time. By leveraging barometric
readings, we estimate sensor height changes, which provide valuable cues for
both improving the accuracy of human pose estimation and predicting global
translation on non-flat terrain. Furthermore, we propose a local thigh
coordinate frame to disentangle local and global motion input for better pose
representation learning. We evaluate our method on both public benchmark
datasets and real-world recordings. Quantitative and qualitative results
demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods
that use IMUs only with the same hardware configuration.

Motivation: 目标检测在深度学习中的改进通常伴随高计算成本，限制了在资源受限设备上的部署。知识蒸馏（KD）通过紧凑学生模型学习大教师模型提供解决方案，但目标检测的双重任务（分类与定位）及数据不平衡等问题带来挑战。

Method: 提出了一种架构中心的KD分类法，区分CNN和Transformer检测器的不同蒸馏方法（如骨干、颈部、头部等），并使用MS COCO和PASCAL VOC数据集评估代表性方法。

Conclusion: 提出的分类法和分析旨在澄清KD在目标检测中的发展现状，突出当前挑战，并指导未来研究开发高效、可扩展的检测系统。

Abstract: Object detection has achieved remarkable accuracy through deep learning, yet
these improvements often come with increased computational cost, limiting
deployment on resource-constrained devices. Knowledge Distillation (KD)
provides an effective solution by enabling compact student models to learn from
larger teacher models. However, adapting KD to object detection poses unique
challenges due to its dual objectives-classification and localization-as well
as foreground-background imbalance and multi-scale feature representation. This
review introduces a novel architecture-centric taxonomy for KD methods,
distinguishing between CNN-based detectors (covering backbone-level,
neck-level, head-level, and RPN/RoI-level distillation) and Transformer-based
detectors (including query-level, feature-level, and logit-level distillation).
We further evaluate representative methods using the MS COCO and PASCAL VOC
datasets with mAP@0.5 as performance metric, providing a comparative analysis
of their effectiveness. The proposed taxonomy and analysis aim to clarify the
evolving landscape of KD in object detection, highlight current challenges, and
guide future research toward efficient and scalable detection systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统雷达手势识别系统需要连续采样和处理数据，功耗和计算开销较大。受生物传感启发，设计了一种低功耗、低延迟的解决方案。

Method: 采用24 GHz多普勒雷达前端和神经形态采样器，通过异步sigma-delta编码将信号转换为稀疏的脉冲表示，并由轻量级神经网络处理。

Result: 在七名用户的五种手势数据集上实现了>85%的实时准确率。

Conclusion: 该框架首次将生物启发的异步sigma-delta编码和事件驱动处理应用于雷达手势识别，显著降低了功耗和计算开销。

Abstract: We present a neuromorphic radar framework for real-time, low-power hand
gesture recognition (HGR) using an event-driven architecture inspired by
biological sensing. Our system comprises a 24 GHz Doppler radar front-end and a
custom neuromorphic sampler that converts intermediate-frequency (IF) signals
into sparse spike-based representations via asynchronous sigma-delta encoding.
These events are directly processed by a lightweight neural network deployed on
a Cortex-M0 microcontroller, enabling low-latency inference without requiring
spectrogram reconstruction. Unlike conventional radar HGR pipelines that
continuously sample and process data, our architecture activates only when
meaningful motion is detected, significantly reducing memory, power, and
computation overhead. Evaluated on a dataset of five gestures collected from
seven users, our system achieves > 85% real-time accuracy. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first work that employs bio-inspired asynchronous
sigma-delta encoding and an event-driven processing framework for radar-based
HGR.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于宏微规划（MMPL）的长视频生成框架，解决了自回归扩散模型在长视频生成中的时间漂移和并行化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归扩散模型在长视频生成中存在时间漂移和并行化限制，影响生成质量和效率。

Method: 采用宏微规划（MMPL）框架，分两阶段规划全局故事线：微观规划预测关键帧，宏观规划确保长期一致性，并行填充中间帧。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在质量和稳定性上优于现有长视频生成模型。

Conclusion: MMPL框架有效解决了长视频生成中的时间漂移和并行化问题，提升了生成效果。

Abstract: Current autoregressive diffusion models excel at video generation but are
generally limited to short temporal durations. Our theoretical analysis
indicates that the autoregressive modeling typically suffers from temporal
drift caused by error accumulation and hinders parallelization in long video
synthesis. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
planning-then-populating framework centered on Macro-from-Micro Planning (MMPL)
for long video generation. MMPL sketches a global storyline for the entire
video through two hierarchical stages: Micro Planning and Macro Planning.
Specifically, Micro Planning predicts a sparse set of future keyframes within
each short video segment, offering motion and appearance priors to guide
high-quality video segment generation. Macro Planning extends the in-segment
keyframes planning across the entire video through an autoregressive chain of
micro plans, ensuring long-term consistency across video segments.
Subsequently, MMPL-based Content Populating generates all intermediate frames
in parallel across segments, enabling efficient parallelization of
autoregressive generation. The parallelization is further optimized by Adaptive
Workload Scheduling for balanced GPU execution and accelerated autoregressive
video generation. Extensive experiments confirm that our method outperforms
existing long video generation models in quality and stability. Generated
videos and comparison results are in our project page.

*Tongshun Zhang,Pingping Liu,Zixuan Zhong,Zijian Zhang,Qiuzhan Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种双阶段方法，通过残差傅里叶引导模块（RFGM）和Mamba模块，高效恢复极暗图像中的细节。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有增强方法难以保留复杂细节和锐利边缘，影响下游应用效果。

Method: 第一阶段使用RFGM恢复全局光照，第二阶段通过Patch Mamba和Grad Mamba模块细化纹理结构。

Result: 在多个基准数据集和下游应用中显著提升细节恢复性能，且模块轻量高效。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效恢复暗图像细节，并可无缝集成到现有傅里叶框架中。

Abstract: Recovering fine-grained details in extremely dark images remains challenging
due to severe structural information loss and noise corruption. Existing
enhancement methods often fail to preserve intricate details and sharp edges,
limiting their effectiveness in downstream applications like text and edge
detection. To address these deficiencies, we propose an efficient dual-stage
approach centered on detail recovery for dark images. In the first stage, we
introduce a Residual Fourier-Guided Module (RFGM) that effectively restores
global illumination in the frequency domain. RFGM captures inter-stage and
inter-channel dependencies through residual connections, providing robust
priors for high-fidelity frequency processing while mitigating error
accumulation risks from unreliable priors. The second stage employs
complementary Mamba modules specifically designed for textural structure
refinement: (1) Patch Mamba operates on channel-concatenated non-downsampled
patches, meticulously modeling pixel-level correlations to enhance fine-grained
details without resolution loss. (2) Grad Mamba explicitly focuses on
high-gradient regions, alleviating state decay in state space models and
prioritizing reconstruction of sharp edges and boundaries. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmark datasets and downstream applications
demonstrate that our method significantly improves detail recovery performance
while maintaining efficiency. Crucially, the proposed modules are lightweight
and can be seamlessly integrated into existing Fourier-based frameworks with
minimal computational overhead. Code is available at

*Shaoguang Wang,Jianxiang He,Yijie Xu,Ziyang Chen,Weiyu Guo,Hui Xiong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种自适应帧剪枝（AFP）方法，通过减少视频帧数量和输入令牌，显著提升了多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在视频问答（Video-QA）中的效率，同时保持了甚至提高了准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前MLLMs在Video-QA中因处理大量视频帧的高令牌成本而受限，且过多的帧会导致性能下降（'less is more'现象）。现有关键帧选择方法仍存在时间冗余（'visual echoes'）。

Method: 提出AFP方法，采用自适应层次聚类算法在融合的ResNet-50和CLIP特征空间上剪枝关键帧，并通过轻量级文本语义图补充信息。

Result: 在LongVideoBench和VideoMME基准测试中，AFP将所需帧数减少86.9%，输入令牌减少83.2%，且准确性优于基线。

Conclusion: AFP通过高效剪枝和补充语义图，显著提升了MLLMs在Video-QA中的效率和性能。

Abstract: The practical application of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to
Video Question Answering (Video-QA) is severely hindered by the high token cost
of processing numerous video frames. While increasing the number of sampled
frames is a common strategy, we observe a "less is more" phenomenon where
excessive frames can paradoxically degrade performance due to context dilution.
Concurrently, state-of-the-art keyframe selection methods, while effective,
still yield significant temporal redundancy, which we term 'visual echoes'. To
address these dual challenges, we propose Adaptive Frame-Pruning (AFP), a novel
post-processing method that intelligently prunes the selected keyframes. AFP
employs an adaptive hierarchical clustering algorithm on a fused ResNet-50 and
CLIP feature space to identify and merge these echoes into single
representatives. To compensate for information loss, we then introduce a
lightweight, text-based semantic graph that provides critical context with
minimal token overhead. Conducting extensive experiments on the LongVideoBench
and VideoMME benchmarks across multiple leading MLLMs, our full approach
demonstrates a drastic reduction in required frames by up to 86.9% and total
input tokens by up to 83.2%. Crucially, by providing a concise, high-quality
set of frames, our method not only enhances efficiency but often improves
accuracy over baselines that use more frames. The code will be released upon
publication.

*Tongshun Zhang,Pingping Liu,Zhe Zhang,Qiuzhan Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出CIVQLLIE框架，通过离散表示学习和因果干预解决低光图像增强问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 夜间图像可见性差，现有方法缺乏解释性或依赖不可靠先验，物理方法假设简化。

Method: 利用向量量化（VQ）学习离散视觉标记，通过多级因果干预校正分布偏移。

Result: 框架有效增强低光图像，提升细节重建能力。

Conclusion: CIVQLLIE结合离散表示与因果干预，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Images captured in nighttime scenes suffer from severely reduced visibility,
hindering effective content perception. Current low-light image enhancement
(LLIE) methods face significant challenges: data-driven end-to-end mapping
networks lack interpretability or rely on unreliable prior guidance, struggling
under extremely dark conditions, while physics-based methods depend on
simplified assumptions that often fail in complex real-world scenarios. To
address these limitations, we propose CIVQLLIE, a novel framework that
leverages the power of discrete representation learning through causal
reasoning. We achieve this through Vector Quantization (VQ), which maps
continuous image features to a discrete codebook of visual tokens learned from
large-scale high-quality images. This codebook serves as a reliable prior,
encoding standardized brightness and color patterns that are independent of
degradation. However, direct application of VQ to low-light images fails due to
distribution shifts between degraded inputs and the learned codebook.
Therefore, we propose a multi-level causal intervention approach to
systematically correct these shifts. First, during encoding, our Pixel-level
Causal Intervention (PCI) module intervenes to align low-level features with
the brightness and color distributions expected by the codebook. Second, a
Feature-aware Causal Intervention (FCI) mechanism with Low-frequency Selective
Attention Gating (LSAG) identifies and enhances channels most affected by
illumination degradation, facilitating accurate codebook token matching while
enhancing the encoder's generalization performance through flexible
feature-level intervention. Finally, during decoding, the High-frequency Detail
Reconstruction Module (HDRM) leverages structural information preserved in the
matched codebook representations to reconstruct fine details using deformable
convolution techniques.

TL;DR: WaMo是一种基于小波的多频率特征提取框架，用于文本-运动检索（TMR），通过捕捉身体关节的多分辨率细节，实现细粒度的文本-运动对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽视了人体运动的复杂时空动态性，导致语义对齐不精确。

Method: WaMo包含三个关键组件：轨迹小波分解、轨迹小波重构和乱序运动序列预测，以提取多分辨率运动特征并增强时空信息保留。

Result: 在HumanML3D和KIT-ML数据集上，WaMo在Rsum指标上分别提升了17.0%和18.2%，优于现有SOTA方法。

Conclusion: WaMo通过多频率特征提取和时空信息保留，显著提升了文本-运动检索的精度。

Abstract: Text-Motion Retrieval (TMR) aims to retrieve 3D motion sequences semantically
relevant to text descriptions. However, matching 3D motions with text remains
highly challenging, primarily due to the intricate structure of human body and
its spatial-temporal dynamics. Existing approaches often overlook these
complexities, relying on general encoding methods that fail to distinguish
different body parts and their dynamics, limiting precise semantic alignment.
To address this, we propose WaMo, a novel wavelet-based multi-frequency feature
extraction framework. It fully captures part-specific and time-varying motion
details across multiple resolutions on body joints, extracting discriminative
motion features to achieve fine-grained alignment with texts. WaMo has three
key components: (1) Trajectory Wavelet Decomposition decomposes motion signals
into frequency components that preserve both local kinematic details and global
motion semantics. (2) Trajectory Wavelet Reconstruction uses learnable inverse
wavelet transforms to reconstruct original joint trajectories from extracted
features, ensuring the preservation of essential spatial-temporal information.
(3) Disordered Motion Sequence Prediction reorders shuffled motion sequences to
improve the learning of inherent temporal coherence, enhancing motion-text
alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate WaMo's superiority, achieving
17.0\% and 18.2\% improvements in $Rsum$ on HumanML3D and KIT-ML datasets,
respectively, outperforming existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对视觉语言模型（VLMs）的重要性感知后训练量化（PTQ）框架VLMQ，解决了模态差异问题，显著提升了低比特量化下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于Hessian的LLM PTQ方法在VLMs上表现不佳，主要由于模态差异（文本令牌有限而视觉令牌冗余）。

Method: VLMQ通过优化重要性感知目标生成增强的Hessian矩阵，并利用轻量级块级反向传播计算令牌级重要性因子。

Result: 在8个基准测试中，VLMQ在0.5B∼32B VLMs上表现出SOTA性能，2比特量化下MME-RealWorld提升16.45%。

Conclusion: VLMQ为VLMs提供了一种高效且有效的PTQ解决方案，显著提升了低比特量化性能。

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) has emerged as an effective approach for
compressing large models and accelerating their inference without retraining.
While PTQ has been extensively studied in the context of large language models
(LLMs), its applicability to vision-language models (VLMs) remains
underexplored. In this paper, we identify a modality discrepancy (\emph{i.e.},
limited text tokens \emph{vs.} excessive and redundant vision tokens) of VLMs.
However, existing Hessian-based LLM PTQ methods treat all tokens equally during
quantization, resulting in severe performance drops when applied to VLMs.
Motivated by this observation, we propose a novel importance-aware PTQ
framework tailored for VLMs, dubbed VLMQ. Specifically, to address vision token
redundancy, VLMQ 1) optimizes an importance-aware objective that yields an
enhanced Hessian with token-level importance factors, while retaining
compatibility with parallelized weight updates, and 2) ensures efficiency and
effectiveness by computing these factors via a single lightweight block-wise
backward pass, guided by a theoretical connection to token-level perturbations.
Extensive evaluations on 8 benchmarks across 0.5B$\sim$32B VLMs demonstrate the
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance of our VLMQ, particularly under low-bit
settings. For example, it achieves a substantial \textbf{16.45\%} improvement
on MME-RealWorld under 2-bit quantization.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统联邦学习在大模型上计算资源需求高的问题。

Method: 两阶段方法：服务器端知识蒸馏对齐大模型与轻量模型，客户端训练分类器并聚合。

Result: 在五个图像分类基准上表现优于现有方法，适用于资源有限客户端。

Conclusion: FedPromo在性能、隐私和资源效率间取得平衡，适用于多领域学习。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is an established paradigm for training deep learning
models on decentralized data. However, as the size of the models grows,
conventional FL approaches often require significant computational resources on
client devices, which may not be feasible. We introduce FedPromo, a novel
framework that enables efficient adaptation of large-scale foundation models
stored on a central server to new domains encountered only by remote clients.
Instead of directly training the large model on client devices, FedPromo
optimizes lightweight proxy models via FL, significantly reducing computational
overhead while maintaining privacy. Our method follows a two-stage process:
first, server-side knowledge distillation aligns the representations of a
large-scale foundation model (e.g., a transformer) with those of a compact
counterpart (e.g., a CNN). Then, the compact model encoder is deployed to
client devices, where trainable classifiers are learned locally. These
classifiers are subsequently aggregated and seamlessly transferred back to the
foundation model, facilitating personalized adaptation without requiring direct
access to user data. Through novel regularization strategies, our framework
enables decentralized multi-domain learning, balancing performance, privacy,
and resource efficiency. Extensive experiments on five image classification
benchmarks demonstrate that FedPromo outperforms existing methods while
assuming limited-resource clients.

Result: 实验表明，DOD在视觉质量和推理效率上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DOD是一种高效且适应性强的图像修复方法，具有显著优势。

Abstract: Diffusion models have revealed powerful potential in all-in-one image
restoration (AiOIR), which is talented in generating abundant texture details.
The existing AiOIR methods either retrain a diffusion model or fine-tune the
pretrained diffusion model with extra conditional guidance. However, they often
suffer from high inference costs and limited adaptability to diverse
degradation types. In this paper, we propose an efficient AiOIR method,
Diffusion Once and Done (DOD), which aims to achieve superior restoration
performance with only one-step sampling of Stable Diffusion (SD) models.
Specifically, multi-degradation feature modulation is first introduced to
capture different degradation prompts with a pretrained diffusion model. Then,
parameter-efficient conditional low-rank adaptation integrates the prompts to
enable the fine-tuning of the SD model for adapting to different degradation
types. Besides, a high-fidelity detail enhancement module is integrated into
the decoder of SD to improve structural and textural details. Experiments
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing diffusion-based restoration
approaches in both visual quality and inference efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度学习方法忽视解剖学背景，而放射科医生依赖解剖学知识准确识别病理。

Result: 在PET/CT数据集上，GRASP在多个评估指标和架构中表现优异。

Conclusion: GRASP的双重解剖学注入策略有效整合解剖学背景，提升病理分割性能。

Abstract: Radiologists rely on anatomical understanding to accurately delineate
pathologies, yet most current deep learning approaches use pure pattern
recognition and ignore the anatomical context in which pathologies develop. To
narrow this gap, we introduce GRASP (Guided Representation Alignment for the
Segmentation of Pathologies), a modular plug-and-play framework that enhances
pathology segmentation models by leveraging existing anatomy segmentation
models through pseudolabel integration and feature alignment. Unlike previous
approaches that obtain anatomical knowledge via auxiliary training, GRASP
integrates into standard pathology optimization regimes without retraining
anatomical components. We evaluate GRASP on two PET/CT datasets, conduct
systematic ablation studies, and investigate the framework's inner workings. We
find that GRASP consistently achieves top rankings across multiple evaluation
metrics and diverse architectures. The framework's dual anatomy injection
strategy, combining anatomical pseudo-labels as input channels with
transformer-guided anatomical feature fusion, effectively incorporates
anatomical context.

Motivation: 现有步态识别方法在新数据集上需要重新训练，且难以保留先前数据集的知识，导致性能下降。

Method: 提出GaitAdapter方法，结合GPAK模块（图神经网络）和EDSM（基于负对的欧氏距离稳定性方法），以提升步态特征的区分能力。

Result: 实验表明，GaitAdapter能有效保留多任务知识，显著优于其他方法。

Conclusion: GaitAdapter通过持续学习和知识聚合，显著提升了步态识别的性能。

Abstract: Current gait recognition methodologies generally necessitate retraining when
encountering new datasets. Nevertheless, retrained models frequently encounter
difficulties in preserving knowledge from previous datasets, leading to a
significant decline in performance on earlier test sets. To tackle these
challenges, we present a continual gait recognition task, termed GaitAdapt,
which supports the progressive enhancement of gait recognition capabilities
over time and is systematically categorized according to various evaluation
scenarios. Additionally, we propose GaitAdapter, a non-replay continual
learning approach for gait recognition. This approach integrates the
GaitPartition Adaptive Knowledge (GPAK) module, employing graph neural networks
to aggregate common gait patterns from current data into a repository
constructed from graph vectors. Subsequently, this repository is used to
improve the discriminability of gait features in new tasks, thereby enhancing
the model's ability to effectively recognize gait patterns. We also introduce a
Euclidean Distance Stability Method (EDSN) based on negative pairs, which
ensures that newly added gait samples from different classes maintain similar
relative spatial distributions across both previous and current gait tasks,
thereby alleviating the impact of task changes on the distinguishability of
original domain features. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that GaitAdapter
effectively retains gait knowledge acquired from diverse tasks, exhibiting
markedly superior discriminative capability compared to alternative methods.

Result: NAVIA在多个分布外基准测试中性能提升超过2.5%，推理延迟降低20%以上。

Conclusion: NAVIA有效解决了ETTA问题，平衡了性能与效率。

Abstract: Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) has emerged as an effective solution for adapting
Vision Transformers (ViT) to distribution shifts without additional training
data. However, existing TTA methods often incur substantial computational
overhead, limiting their applicability in resource-constrained real-world
scenarios. To reduce inference cost, plug-and-play token aggregation methods
merge redundant tokens in ViTs to reduce total processed tokens. Albeit
efficient, it suffers from significant performance degradation when directly
integrated with existing TTA methods. We formalize this problem as Efficient
Test-Time Adaptation (ETTA), seeking to preserve the adaptation capability of
TTA while reducing inference latency. In this paper, we first provide a
theoretical analysis from a novel mutual information perspective, showing that
token aggregation inherently leads to information loss, which cannot be fully
mitigated by conventional norm-tuning-based TTA methods. Guided by this
insight, we propose to \textbf{N}eutralize Token \textbf{A}ggregation
\textbf{v}ia \textbf{I}nformation \textbf{A}ugmentation (\textbf{NAVIA}).
Specifically, we directly augment the [CLS] token embedding and incorporate
adaptive biases into the [CLS] token in shallow layers of ViTs. We
theoretically demonstrate that these augmentations, when optimized via entropy
minimization, recover the information lost due to token aggregation. Extensive
experiments across various out-of-distribution benchmarks demonstrate that
NAVIA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by over 2.5\%, while
achieving an inference latency reduction of more than 20\%, effectively
addressing the ETTA challenge.

TL;DR: DepthGait结合RGB深度图和轮廓图提升步态识别性能，通过多尺度跨模态融合实现卓越表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有2D轮廓和骨架表示在视角变化和细节捕捉上不足，需更丰富的输入模态。

Method: 引入RGB深度图作为新模态，开发多尺度跨级融合方案。

Result: 在标准基准测试中达到最先进性能，挑战数据集上表现优异。

Conclusion: DepthGait通过多模态融合显著提升步态识别的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Robust gait recognition requires highly discriminative representations, which
are closely tied to input modalities. While binary silhouettes and skeletons
have dominated recent literature, these 2D representations fall short of
capturing sufficient cues that can be exploited to handle viewpoint variations,
and capture finer and meaningful details of gait. In this paper, we introduce a
novel framework, termed DepthGait, that incorporates RGB-derived depth maps and
silhouettes for enhanced gait recognition. Specifically, apart from the 2D
silhouette representation of the human body, the proposed pipeline explicitly
estimates depth maps from a given RGB image sequence and uses them as a new
modality to capture discriminative features inherent in human locomotion. In
addition, a novel multi-scale and cross-level fusion scheme has also been
developed to bridge the modality gap between depth maps and silhouettes.
Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed
DepthGait achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to peer methods and
attains an impressive mean rank-1 accuracy on the challenging datasets.

TL;DR: SCFlow提出了一种通过可逆合并风格与内容的方法，避免显式解耦的挑战，并在零样本设置中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于风格与内容的语义重叠和人类感知的主观性，显式解耦在视觉模型中仍具挑战性。现有方法通过生成或判别目标进行分离，但仍面临概念交织的模糊性。

Method: SCFlow采用流匹配框架，学习风格与内容之间的双向映射，通过合成数据集训练可逆变体。

Result: SCFlow在ImageNet-1k和WikiArt的零样本设置中表现优异，验证了解耦可从可逆合并过程中自然涌现。

Conclusion: SCFlow通过可逆合并风格与内容，无需显式监督即可实现解耦，为视觉模型提供了一种新思路。

Abstract: Explicitly disentangling style and content in vision models remains
challenging due to their semantic overlap and the subjectivity of human
perception. Existing methods propose separation through generative or
discriminative objectives, but they still face the inherent ambiguity of
disentangling intertwined concepts. Instead, we ask: Can we bypass explicit
disentanglement by learning to merge style and content invertibly, allowing
separation to emerge naturally? We propose SCFlow, a flow-matching framework
that learns bidirectional mappings between entangled and disentangled
representations. Our approach is built upon three key insights: 1) Training
solely to merge style and content, a well-defined task, enables invertible
disentanglement without explicit supervision; 2) flow matching bridges on
arbitrary distributions, avoiding the restrictive Gaussian priors of diffusion
models and normalizing flows; and 3) a synthetic dataset of 510,000 samples (51
styles $\times$ 10,000 content samples) was curated to simulate disentanglement
through systematic style-content pairing. Beyond controllable generation tasks,
we demonstrate that SCFlow generalizes to ImageNet-1k and WikiArt in zero-shot
settings and achieves competitive performance, highlighting that
disentanglement naturally emerges from the invertible merging process.

Motivation: 高光谱解混是预处理关键步骤，现有方法在精度上仍有提升空间。

Method: 采用多层矩阵分解模型，结合总变分约束和L1/2范数稀疏约束，使用ADMM优化。

Result: 实验表明STVMLU优于其他算法。

Conclusion: STVMLU方法有效提升了高光谱解混的精度和性能。

Abstract: Hyperspectral unmixing aims at estimating material signatures (known as
endmembers) and the corresponding proportions (referred to abundances), which
is a critical preprocessing step in various hyperspectral imagery applications.
This study develops a novel approach called sparsity and total variation (TV)
constrained multilayer linear unmixing (STVMLU) for hyperspectral imagery.
Specifically, based on a multilayer matrix factorization model, to improve the
accuracy of unmixing, a TV constraint is incorporated to consider adjacent
spatial similarity. Additionally, a L1/2-norm sparse constraint is adopted to
effectively characterize the sparsity of the abundance matrix. For optimizing
the STVMLU model, the method of alternating direction method of multipliers
(ADMM) is employed, which allows for the simultaneous extraction of endmembers
and their corresponding abundance matrix. Experimental results illustrate the
enhanced performance of the proposed STVMLU when compared to other algorithms.

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在参数规模、自校正能力和复杂推理任务上表现不足，MACT旨在解决这些问题。

Method: MACT包含四个代理（规划、执行、判断、回答），通过混合奖励建模和代理级测试时扩展优化协作。

Result: MACT在15个基准测试中13个领先，参数规模更小且性能更优。

Conclusion: MACT在多代理协作和测试时扩展的支持下，显著提升了视觉文档理解和复杂推理任务的表现。

Abstract: Existing vision-language models (VLMs), whether generalists or specialists,
remain constrained by their parameter scale, lack robust self-correction
capabilities, and underperform in tasks involving long visual contexts and
complex reasoning, resulting in suboptimal performance on document-based tasks.
To address this, we propose MACT, a Multi-Agent Collaboration framework with
Test-Time scaling, tailored for visual document understanding and visual
question answering (VQA). It comprises four distinct small-scale agents, i.e.,
planning, execution, judgment, and answer agents, with clearly defined roles
and effective collaboration. Notably, the judgment agent exclusively verifies
correctness and redirects to prior agents for revisions, outperforming
conventional correction strategies. To further expand the capability boundaries
of the framework, we propose mixed reward modeling that balances agent-specific
abilities and global collaboration, as well as agent-wise hybrid test-time
scaling, which customizes different scaling strategies for each agent based on
their functions. Evaluated on benchmarks spanning both document-based and
non-document-based settings, our MACT shows superior performance with a smaller
parameter scale without sacrificing the ability of general and mathematical
tasks. Especially, it stands out in benchmarks involving long visual contexts
and complicated reasoning. The three variants of MACT consistently hold the top
three positions in average scores, leading in 13 of the 15 benchmarks. Code

Motivation: 解决无监督视频分割任务中缺乏监督信号和复杂视觉场景的挑战，同时减少计算成本。

Method: 通过余弦相似度对齐教师和学生模型的槽表示，无需额外蒸馏目标或辅助监督。

Result: 学生模型在参数减少3.6倍、速度提升1.9倍的情况下，性能优于教师模型和其他无监督视频分割模型。

Conclusion: SlotMatch框架简单高效，证明了额外损失的冗余性，为轻量级模型提供了新思路。

Abstract: Unsupervised video segmentation is a challenging computer vision task,
especially due to the lack of supervisory signals coupled with the complexity
of visual scenes. To overcome this challenge, state-of-the-art models based on
slot attention often have to rely on large and computationally expensive neural
architectures. To this end, we propose a simple knowledge distillation
framework that effectively transfers object-centric representations to a
lightweight student. The proposed framework, called SlotMatch, aligns
corresponding teacher and student slots via the cosine similarity, requiring no
additional distillation objectives or auxiliary supervision. The simplicity of
SlotMatch is confirmed via theoretical and empirical evidence, both indicating
that integrating additional losses is redundant. We conduct experiments on two
datasets to compare the state-of-the-art teacher model, SlotContrast, with our
distilled student. The results show that our student based on SlotMatch matches
and even outperforms its teacher, while using 3.6x less parameters and running
1.9x faster. Moreover, our student surpasses previous unsupervised video
segmentation models.

Abstract: X-ray medical report generation is one of the important applications of
artificial intelligence in healthcare. With the support of large foundation
models, the quality of medical report generation has significantly improved.
However, challenges such as hallucination and weak disease diagnostic
capability still persist. In this paper, we first construct a large-scale
multi-modal medical knowledge graph (termed M3KG) based on the ground truth
medical report using the GPT-4o. It contains 2477 entities, 3 kinds of
relations, 37424 triples, and 6943 disease-aware vision tokens for the CheXpert
Plus dataset. Then, we sample it to obtain multi-granularity semantic graphs
and use an R-GCN encoder for feature extraction. For the input X-ray image, we
adopt the Swin-Transformer to extract the vision features and interact with the
knowledge using cross-attention. The vision tokens are fed into a Q-former and
retrieved the disease-aware vision tokens using another cross-attention.
Finally, we adopt the large language model to map the semantic knowledge graph,
input X-ray image, and disease-aware vision tokens into language descriptions.
Extensive experiments on multiple datasets fully validated the effectiveness of
our proposed knowledge graph and X-ray report generation framework. The source

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG信号分类因电极配置、采集协议和硬件差异导致数据分布偏移，亟需一种鲁棒的方法。

Method: IMAC采用3D到2D位置统一映射标准化电极布局，引入时空信号对齐和通道依赖掩码重构任务。

Result: 在10个公开EEG数据集上，IMAC在跨主体和跨中心验证中达到最优分类准确率，鲁棒性显著提升。

Conclusion: IMAC通过时空对齐和分离建模，有效解决了跨域EEG信号分类问题，性能优于基线方法。

Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal classification faces significant challenges
due to data distribution shifts caused by heterogeneous electrode
configurations, acquisition protocols, and hardware discrepancies across
domains. This paper introduces IMAC, a novel channel-dependent mask and
imputation self-supervised framework that formulates the alignment of
cross-domain EEG data shifts as a spatial time series imputation task. To
address heterogeneous electrode configurations in cross-domain scenarios, IMAC
first standardizes different electrode layouts using a 3D-to-2D positional
unification mapping strategy, establishing unified spatial representations.
Unlike previous mask-based self-supervised representation learning methods,
IMAC introduces spatio-temporal signal alignment. This involves constructing a
channel-dependent mask and reconstruction task framed as a low-to-high
resolution EEG spatial imputation problem. Consequently, this approach
simulates cross-domain variations such as channel omissions and temporal
instabilities, thus enabling the model to leverage the proposed imputer for
robust signal alignment during inference. Furthermore, IMAC incorporates a
disentangled structure that separately models the temporal and spatial
information of the EEG signals separately, reducing computational complexity
while enhancing flexibility and adaptability. Comprehensive evaluations across
10 publicly available EEG datasets demonstrate IMAC's superior performance,
achieving state-of-the-art classification accuracy in both cross-subject and
cross-center validation scenarios. Notably, IMAC shows strong robustness under
both simulated and real-world distribution shifts, surpassing baseline methods
by up to $35$\% in integrity scores while maintaining consistent classification
accuracy.

TL;DR: MedCAL-Bench是首个基于基础模型（FMs）的冷启动主动学习（CSAL）基准测试，用于医学图像分析，评估了14种FMs和7种CSAL策略，揭示了FMs在特征提取和样本选择中的表现差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 冷启动主动学习（CSAL）在医学图像分析中缺乏先验知识时选择信息样本，现有方法依赖自监督学习（SSL），效率低且特征表示不足。基础模型（FMs）具有强大特征提取能力，但缺乏相关研究。

Method: 提出MedCAL-Bench基准测试，评估14种FMs和7种CSAL策略在7个数据集上的表现，涵盖分类和分割任务，并首次同时评估特征提取和样本选择阶段。

Result: 1）大多数FMs是有效的特征提取器，DINO家族在分割任务中表现最佳；2）FMs在分割任务中性能差异大，分类任务中差异小；3）不同数据集需采用不同样本选择策略。

Conclusion: MedCAL-Bench为医学图像分析中的CSAL提供了系统评估，展示了FMs的潜力，并强调了策略选择的重要性。

Abstract: Cold-Start Active Learning (CSAL) aims to select informative samples for
annotation without prior knowledge, which is important for improving annotation
efficiency and model performance under a limited annotation budget in medical
image analysis. Most existing CSAL methods rely on Self-Supervised Learning
(SSL) on the target dataset for feature extraction, which is inefficient and
limited by insufficient feature representation. Recently, pre-trained
Foundation Models (FMs) have shown powerful feature extraction ability with a
potential for better CSAL. However, this paradigm has been rarely investigated,
with a lack of benchmarks for comparison of FMs in CSAL tasks. To this end, we
propose MedCAL-Bench, the first systematic FM-based CSAL benchmark for medical
image analysis. We evaluate 14 FMs and 7 CSAL strategies across 7 datasets
under different annotation budgets, covering classification and segmentation
tasks from diverse medical modalities. It is also the first CSAL benchmark that
evaluates both the feature extraction and sample selection stages. Our
experimental results reveal that: 1) Most FMs are effective feature extractors
for CSAL, with DINO family performing the best in segmentation; 2) The
performance differences of these FMs are large in segmentation tasks, while
small for classification; 3) Different sample selection strategies should be
considered in CSAL on different datasets, with Active Learning by Processing
Surprisal (ALPS) performing the best in segmentation while RepDiv leading for
classification. The code is available at

Result: 实验证明该方法可提升3倍采样速度，同时保持或改进生成质量、鲁棒性和语义对齐。

Conclusion: 自适应引导调度对快速流式生成模型的性能优化至关重要。

Abstract: Flow-based generative models have recently achieved remarkable progress in
image and video synthesis, with classifier-free guidance (CFG) becoming the
standard tool for high-fidelity, controllable generation. However, despite
their practical success, little is known about how guidance interacts with
different stages of the sampling process-especially in the fast, low-step
regimes typical of modern flow-based pipelines. In this work, we uncover and
analyze a fundamental instability: the earliest reverse steps are acutely
sensitive to the guidance scale, owing to a pronounced spike in the relative
strength (RATIO) of conditional to unconditional predictions. Through rigorous
theoretical analysis and empirical validation, we show that this RATIO spike is
intrinsic to the data distribution, independent of the model architecture, and
causes exponential error amplification when paired with strong guidance. To
address this, we propose a simple, theoretically grounded, RATIO-aware adaptive
guidance schedule that automatically dampens the guidance scale at early steps
based on the evolving RATIO, using a closed-form exponential decay. Our method
is lightweight, requires no additional inference overhead, and is compatible
with standard flow frameworks. Experiments across state-of-the-art image
(SD3.5, Lumina) and video (WAN2.1) models demonstrate that our approach enables
up to 3x faster sampling while maintaining or improving generation quality,
robustness, and semantic alignment. Extensive ablation studies further confirm
the generality and stability of our schedule across models, datasets, and
hyperparameters. Our findings highlight the critical role of stepwise guidance
adaptation in unlocking the full potential of fast flow-based generative
models.

Abstract: Recently, large pre-trained vision-language models have shown remarkable
performance in zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD). With fine-tuning on a single
auxiliary dataset, the model enables cross-category anomaly detection on
diverse datasets covering industrial defects and medical lesions. Compared to
manually designed prompts, prompt learning eliminates the need for expert
knowledge and trial-and-error. However, it still faces the following
challenges: (i) static learnable tokens struggle to capture the continuous and
diverse patterns of normal and anomalous states, limiting generalization to
unseen categories; (ii) fixed textual labels provide overly sparse category
information, making the model prone to overfitting to a specific semantic
subspace. To address these issues, we propose Conditional Prompt Synthesis
(CoPS), a novel framework that synthesizes dynamic prompts conditioned on
visual features to enhance ZSAD performance. Specifically, we extract
representative normal and anomaly prototypes from fine-grained patch features
and explicitly inject them into prompts, enabling adaptive state modeling.
Given the sparsity of class labels, we leverage a variational autoencoder to
model semantic image features and implicitly fuse varied class tokens into
prompts. Additionally, integrated with our spatially-aware alignment mechanism,
extensive experiments demonstrate that CoPS surpasses state-of-the-art methods
by 2.5% AUROC in both classification and segmentation across 13 industrial and
medical datasets. Code will be available at https://github.com/cqylunlun/CoPS.

Conclusion: 双摄像头框架有效解决了摩尔纹问题，同时保持了纹理和色调的一致性。

Abstract: Moire patterns, unwanted color artifacts in images and videos, arise from the
interference between spatially high-frequency scene contents and the spatial
discrete sampling of digital cameras. Existing demoireing methods primarily
rely on single-camera image/video processing, which faces two critical
challenges: 1) distinguishing moire patterns from visually similar real
textures, and 2) preserving tonal consistency and temporal coherence while
removing moire artifacts. To address these issues, we propose a dual-camera
framework that captures synchronized videos of the same scene: one in focus
(retaining high-quality textures but may exhibit moire patterns) and one
defocused (with significantly reduced moire patterns but blurred textures). We
use the defocused video to help distinguish moire patterns from real texture,
so as to guide the demoireing of the focused video. We propose a frame-wise
demoireing pipeline, which begins with an optical flow based alignment step to
address any discrepancies in displacement and occlusion between the focused and
defocused frames. Then, we leverage the aligned defocused frame to guide the
demoireing of the focused frame using a multi-scale CNN and a multi-dimensional
training loss. To maintain tonal and temporal consistency, our final step
involves a joint bilateral filter to leverage the demoireing result from the
CNN as the guide to filter the input focused frame to obtain the final output.
Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework largely
outperforms state-of-the-art image and video demoireing methods.

Conclusion: AVPDN在视频息肉检测任务中具有竞争力，为结肠癌早期诊断提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Accurate detection of polyps is of critical importance for the early and
intermediate stages of colorectal cancer diagnosis. Compared to static images,
dynamic colonoscopy videos provide more comprehensive visual information, which
can facilitate the development of effective treatment plans. However, unlike
fixed-camera recordings, colonoscopy videos often exhibit rapid camera
movement, introducing substantial background noise that disrupts the structural
integrity of the scene and increases the risk of false positives. To address
these challenges, we propose the Adaptive Video Polyp Detection Network
(AVPDN), a robust framework for multi-scale polyp detection in colonoscopy
videos. AVPDN incorporates two key components: the Adaptive Feature Interaction
and Augmentation (AFIA) module and the Scale-Aware Context Integration (SACI)
module. The AFIA module adopts a triple-branch architecture to enhance feature
representation. It employs dense self-attention for global context modeling,
sparse self-attention to mitigate the influence of low query-key similarity in
feature aggregation, and channel shuffle operations to facilitate inter-branch
information exchange. In parallel, the SACI module is designed to strengthen
multi-scale feature integration. It utilizes dilated convolutions with varying
receptive fields to capture contextual information at multiple spatial scales,
thereby improving the model's denoising capability. Experiments conducted on
several challenging public benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and
generalization ability of the proposed method, achieving competitive
performance in video-based polyp detection tasks.

Result: 实验表明IKOD能有效减少幻觉并提升LVLMs的综合能力，且无需额外成本。

Conclusion: IKOD是一种轻量高效的解码策略，适用于多种模型，能显著改善LVLMs的幻觉问题。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated
significant progress across multiple domains. However, these models still face
the inherent challenge of integrating vision and language for collaborative
inference, which often leads to "hallucinations", outputs that are not grounded
in the corresponding images. Many efforts have been made to address these
issues, but each comes with its own limitations, such as high computational
cost or expensive dataset annotation. Recent research shows that LVLMs exhibit
a long-term bias where hallucinations increase as the sequence length grows,
yet the underlying cause remains poorly understood. Building on extensive
research into attention mechanisms in LVLMs, we analyze the relationship
between this long-term bias and visual attention. In our research, we identify
a consistent phenomenon in current LVLMs: the model's attention to visual input
diminishes as the generated sequence grows, which we hypothesize to be a key
factor contributing to observed increasing hallucinations. Based on these
insights, we propose Image attention-guided Key-value merging cOllaborative
Decoding (IKOD), a collaborative decoding strategy generating more
image-focused sequences. This method derives logits from shorter sequences with
higher image attention through key-value merging and combines them with those
from the original decoding, effectively mitigating attention degradation and
suppressing hallucinations while not incurring too much inference cost.
Extensive experiments on both hallucination and comprehensive benchmarks
demonstrate IKOD's superior effectiveness in mitigating hallucinations and
improving comprehensive capacities for LVLMs. Importantly, IKOD requires no
additional training or external tools, making it a lightweight and efficient
framework applicable to various models.

*Junjie Cao,Kaizhou Li,Xinchun Yu,Hongxiang Li,Xiaoping Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoGuard是一种保护视频免受未经授权恶意编辑的方法，通过引入几乎不可察觉的扰动干扰生成扩散模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成技术的快速发展可能被恶意利用，现有研究对视频内容的保护不足。

Method: 采用联合帧优化和视频运动信息融合的方法，优化扰动以干扰生成模型。

Result: VideoGuard的保护性能优于所有基线方法。

Conclusion: VideoGuard有效解决了视频内容保护的不足，为视频安全提供了新方案。

Abstract: With the rapid development of generative technology, current generative
models can generate high-fidelity digital content and edit it in a controlled
manner. However, there is a risk that malicious individuals might misuse these
capabilities for misleading activities. Although existing research has
attempted to shield photographic images from being manipulated by generative
models, there remains a significant disparity in the protection offered to
video content editing. To bridge the gap, we propose a protection method named
VideoGuard, which can effectively protect videos from unauthorized malicious
editing. This protection is achieved through the subtle introduction of nearly
unnoticeable perturbations that interfere with the functioning of the intended
generative diffusion models. Due to the redundancy between video frames, and
inter-frame attention mechanism in video diffusion models, simply applying
image-based protection methods separately to every video frame can not shield
video from unauthorized editing. To tackle the above challenge, we adopt joint
frame optimization, treating all video frames as an optimization entity.
Furthermore, we extract video motion information and fuse it into optimization
objectives. Thus, these alterations can effectively force the models to produce
outputs that are implausible and inconsistent. We provide a pipeline to
optimize this perturbation. Finally, we use both objective metrics and
subjective metrics to demonstrate the efficacy of our method, and the results
show that the protection performance of VideoGuard is superior to all the
baseline methods.

*Hyungjin Kim,Seokho Ahn,Young-Duk Seo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为DrUM的新方法，通过条件级建模在潜在空间中实现个性化生成，解决了现有T2I扩散模型因输入标记容量有限导致的个性化不准确问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有T2I扩散模型主要依赖提示级建模，因输入标记容量有限导致个性化不准确，需改进。

Method: DrUM方法结合用户画像和基于变压器的适配器，在潜在空间中进行条件级建模。

Result: DrUM在大规模数据集上表现优异，并能与开源文本编码器无缝集成，无需额外微调即可兼容主流T2I模型。

Conclusion: DrUM通过条件级建模有效提升个性化生成的准确性，具有广泛兼容性。

Abstract: Personalized generation in T2I diffusion models aims to naturally incorporate
individual user preferences into the generation process with minimal user
intervention. However, existing studies primarily rely on prompt-level modeling
with large-scale models, often leading to inaccurate personalization due to the
limited input token capacity of T2I diffusion models. To address these
limitations, we propose DrUM, a novel method that integrates user profiling
with a transformer-based adapter to enable personalized generation through
condition-level modeling in the latent space. DrUM demonstrates strong
performance on large-scale datasets and seamlessly integrates with open-source
text encoders, making it compatible with widely used foundation T2I models
without requiring additional fine-tuning.

*Dasol Choi Jihwan Lee,Minjae Lee,Minsuk Kahng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出SODA框架，用于检测生成对象中的隐性人口统计偏见，发现模型输出中存在刻板印象和视觉差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究文本到图像生成中对象的人口统计偏见，填补了现有研究主要关注人类描绘偏见的空白。

Method: 引入SODA框架，通过比较中性提示与人口统计提示生成的2700张图像，分析视觉属性差异。

Result: 发现模型输出中存在与人口统计相关的刻板印象和视觉差异，部分模型多样性较低。

Conclusion: SODA框架为检测生成模型中的偏见提供了实用方法，是迈向更负责任AI开发的重要一步。

Abstract: While prior research on text-to-image generation has predominantly focused on
biases in human depictions, we investigate a more subtle yet pervasive
phenomenon: demographic bias in generated objects (e.g., cars). We introduce
SODA (Stereotyped Object Diagnostic Audit), a novel framework for
systematically measuring such biases. Our approach compares visual attributes
of objects generated with demographic cues (e.g., "for young people'') to those
from neutral prompts, across 2,700 images produced by three state-of-the-art
models (GPT Image-1, Imagen 4, and Stable Diffusion) in five object categories.
Through a comprehensive analysis, we uncover strong associations between
specific demographic groups and visual attributes, such as recurring color
patterns prompted by gender or ethnicity cues. These patterns reflect and
reinforce not only well-known stereotypes but also more subtle and unintuitive
biases. We also observe that some models generate less diverse outputs, which
in turn amplifies the visual disparities compared to neutral prompts. Our
proposed auditing framework offers a practical approach for testing, revealing
how stereotypes still remain embedded in today's generative models. We see this
as an essential step toward more systematic and responsible AI development.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LRQ-DiT提出了一种高效的PTQ框架，通过Twin-Log量化和自适应旋转方案解决了DiT模型在低比特量化中的权重分布和激活异常问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DiT模型在文本到图像生成中表现优异，但高计算成本和参数量限制了其在资源受限场景下的应用。现有PTQ方法在极低比特设置下性能下降严重。

Method: 提出LRQ-DiT框架，包括Twin-Log量化（TLQ）和自适应旋转方案（ARS），分别优化权重分布和激活异常问题。

Result: 在PixArt和FLUX等模型上验证，LRQ-DiT在低比特量化下保持图像质量，优于现有PTQ基线。

Conclusion: LRQ-DiT有效解决了DiT模型的低比特量化问题，为资源受限场景提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have achieved impressive performance in
text-to-image generation. However, their high computational cost and large
parameter sizes pose significant challenges for usage in resource-constrained
scenarios. Post-training quantization (PTQ) is a promising solution to reduce
memory usage and accelerate inference, but existing PTQ methods suffer from
severe performance degradation under extreme low-bit settings. We identify two
key obstacles to low-bit post-training quantization for DiT models: (1) model
weights follow a Gaussian-like distribution with long tails, causing uniform
quantization to poorly allocate intervals and leading to significant errors;
(2) two types of activation outliers: (i) Mild Outliers with slightly elevated
values, and (ii) Salient Outliers with large magnitudes concentrated in
specific channels, which disrupt activation quantization. To address these
issues, we propose LRQ-DiT, an efficient and accurate PTQ framework. We
introduce Twin-Log Quantization (TLQ), a log-based method that aligns well with
the weight distribution and reduces quantization errors. We also propose an
Adaptive Rotation Scheme (ARS) that dynamically applies Hadamard or
outlier-aware rotations based on activation fluctuation, effectively mitigating
the impact of both types of outliers. We evaluate LRQ-DiT on PixArt and FLUX
under various bit-width settings, and validate the performance on COCO, MJHQ,
and sDCI datasets. LRQ-DiT achieves low-bit quantization of DiT models while
preserving image quality, outperforming existing PTQ baselines.

TL;DR: 提出ParticleSAM方法，改进分割基础模型以处理建筑颗粒图像，并创建新数据集验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 建筑行业资源消耗大，回收材料质量监测仍依赖人工，需更高效的视觉机器学习方法。

Method: 改进分割基础模型（ParticleSAM），适用于小且密集的颗粒图像，并建立自动化生成的数据集。

Result: 实验证明ParticleSAM优于原SAM方法，适用于建筑颗粒分割及其他小颗粒领域。

Conclusion: ParticleSAM为建筑颗粒质量监控提供高效解决方案，并具广泛适用性。

Abstract: The construction industry represents a major sector in terms of resource
consumption. Recycled construction material has high reuse potential, but
quality monitoring of the aggregates is typically still performed with manual
methods. Vision-based machine learning methods could offer a faster and more
efficient solution to this problem, but existing segmentation methods are by
design not directly applicable to images with hundreds of small particles. In
this paper, we propose ParticleSAM, an adaptation of the segmentation
foundation model to images with small and dense objects such as the ones often
encountered in construction material particles. Moreover, we create a new dense
multi-particle dataset simulated from isolated particle images with the
assistance of an automated data generation and labeling pipeline. This dataset
serves as a benchmark for visual material quality control automation while our
segmentation approach has the potential to be valuable in application areas
beyond construction where small-particle segmentation is needed. Our
experimental results validate the advantages of our method by comparing to the
original SAM method both in quantitative and qualitative experiments.

*Mohammadsadegh Khoshghiaferezaee,Moritz Krauth,Shima Shabani,Michael Breuß*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了稀疏字典学习（SDL）中稀疏性对图像恢复质量的影响，发现不同优化方法会导致不同的稀疏性表现，且高稀疏性通常不会损害恢复质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏性是SDL解决方案的重要特性，但稀疏性程度对恢复质量的影响尚不明确，本文旨在探讨这一问题。

Method: 通过多种优化方法（如迭代收缩算法）分析SDL问题，研究不同方法下稀疏性的表现。

Result: 实验表明，不同优化方法会导致不同的稀疏性表现，且高稀疏性通常不会损害图像恢复质量。

Conclusion: 高稀疏性在SDL中是可取的，即使恢复图像与学习数据库差异较大，也不会显著影响恢复质量。

Abstract: Sparse dictionary learning (SDL) is a fundamental technique that is useful
for many image processing tasks. As an example we consider here image recovery,
where SDL can be cast as a nonsmooth optimization problem. For this kind of
problems, iterative shrinkage methods represent a powerful class of algorithms
that are subject of ongoing research. Sparsity is an important property of the
learned solutions, as exactly the sparsity enables efficient further processing
or storage. The sparsity implies that a recovered image is determined as a
combination of a number of dictionary elements that is as low as possible.
Therefore, the question arises, to which degree sparsity should be enforced in
SDL in order to not compromise recovery quality. In this paper we focus on the
sparsity of solutions that can be obtained using a variety of optimization
methods. It turns out that there are different sparsity regimes depending on
the method in use. Furthermore, we illustrate that high sparsity does in
general not compromise recovery quality, even if the recovered image is quite
different from the learning database.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为PECM的框架，通过多级原型和双流置信度估计提升跨模态检索的鲁棒性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医学图像与文本报告对齐中的模糊性和变异性问题，现有模型难以捕捉多层次的语义关系。

Method: PECM框架引入多级原型和双流置信度估计，利用原型相似性分布和自适应加权机制。

Result: 在放射学数据集上显著提升检索精度和一致性，性能提升高达10.17%。

Conclusion: PECM有效处理数据模糊性，提升了复杂临床场景下的检索可靠性。

Abstract: In cross-modal retrieval tasks, such as image-to-report and report-to-image
retrieval, accurately aligning medical images with relevant text reports is
essential but challenging due to the inherent ambiguity and variability in
medical data. Existing models often struggle to capture the nuanced,
multi-level semantic relationships in radiology data, leading to unreliable
retrieval results. To address these issues, we propose the Prototype-Enhanced
Confidence Modeling (PECM) framework, which introduces multi-level prototypes
for each modality to better capture semantic variability and enhance retrieval
robustness. PECM employs a dual-stream confidence estimation that leverages
prototype similarity distributions and an adaptive weighting mechanism to
control the impact of high-uncertainty data on retrieval rankings. Applied to
radiology image-report datasets, our method achieves significant improvements
in retrieval precision and consistency, effectively handling data ambiguity and
advancing reliability in complex clinical scenarios. We report results on
multiple different datasets and tasks including fully supervised and zero-shot
retrieval obtaining performance gains of up to 10.17%, establishing in new
state-of-the-art.

Result: 成功构建了首个专为服装编辑设计的指令数据集EditGarment。

Conclusion: 该方法为服装编辑任务提供了可靠的数据支持，推动了相关领域的发展。

Abstract: Instruction-based garment editing enables precise image modifications via
natural language, with broad applications in fashion design and customization.
Unlike general editing tasks, it requires understanding garment-specific
semantics and attribute dependencies. However, progress is limited by the
scarcity of high-quality instruction-image pairs, as manual annotation is
costly and hard to scale. While MLLMs have shown promise in automated data
synthesis, their application to garment editing is constrained by imprecise
instruction modeling and a lack of fashion-specific supervisory signals. To
address these challenges, we present an automated pipeline for constructing a
garment editing dataset. We first define six editing instruction categories
aligned with real-world fashion workflows to guide the generation of balanced
and diverse instruction-image triplets. Second, we introduce Fashion Edit
Score, a semantic-aware evaluation metric that captures semantic dependencies
between garment attributes and provides reliable supervision during
construction. Using this pipeline, we construct a total of 52,257 candidate
triplets and retain 20,596 high-quality triplets to build EditGarment, the
first instruction-based dataset tailored to standalone garment editing. The

Result: 在三个医学数据集上实现了精确分割，无需额外训练，优于传统方法和无训练模型。

Conclusion: MAUP策略有效提升了跨域少样本医学图像分割的性能和实用性。

Abstract: Cross-domain Few-shot Medical Image Segmentation (CD-FSMIS) is a potential
solution for segmenting medical images with limited annotation using knowledge
from other domains. The significant performance of current CD-FSMIS models
relies on the heavily training procedure over other source medical domains,
which degrades the universality and ease of model deployment. With the
development of large visual models of natural images, we propose a
training-free CD-FSMIS model that introduces the Multi-center Adaptive
Uncertainty-aware Prompting (MAUP) strategy for adapting the foundation model
Segment Anything Model (SAM), which is trained with natural images, into the
CD-FSMIS task. To be specific, MAUP consists of three key innovations: (1)
K-means clustering based multi-center prompts generation for comprehensive
spatial coverage, (2) uncertainty-aware prompts selection that focuses on the
challenging regions, and (3) adaptive prompt optimization that can dynamically
adjust according to the target region complexity. With the pre-trained DINOv2
feature encoder, MAUP achieves precise segmentation results across three
medical datasets without any additional training compared with several
conventional CD-FSMIS models and training-free FSMIS model. The source code is

Motivation: 终身行人重识别面临的关键挑战是平衡旧知识的保留与新信息的适应。现有方法通常忽略特定分布感知和跨域统一知识学习，导致性能受限。

Method: 提出DKUA框架，包括分布感知模型、自适应知识整合（AKC）、统一知识关联（UKA）机制和基于分布的知识转移（DKT）。

Result: 实验结果显示，DKUA在抗遗忘和泛化能力上分别平均提升了7.6%和5.3%。

Conclusion: DKUA框架通过域风格建模和知识统一，显著提升了终身行人重识别的性能，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Lifelong person re-identification (LReID) encounters a key challenge:
balancing the preservation of old knowledge with adaptation to new information.
Existing LReID methods typically employ knowledge distillation to enforce
representation alignment. However, these approaches ignore two crucial aspects:
specific distribution awareness and cross-domain unified knowledge learning,
both of which are essential for addressing this challenge. To overcome these
limitations, we propose a novel distribution-aware knowledge unification and
association (DKUA) framework where domain-style modeling is performed for each
instance to propagate domain-specific representations, enhancing
anti-forgetting and generalization capacity. Specifically, we design a
distribution-aware model to transfer instance-level representations of the
current domain into the domain-specific representations with the different
domain styles, preserving learned knowledge without storing old samples. Next,
we propose adaptive knowledge consolidation (AKC) to dynamically generate the
unified representation as a cross-domain representation center. To further
mitigate forgetting, we develop a unified knowledge association (UKA)
mechanism, which explores the unified representation as a bridge to explicitly
model inter-domain associations, reducing inter-domain gaps. Finally,
distribution-based knowledge transfer (DKT) is proposed to prevent the current
domain distribution from deviating from the cross-domain distribution center,
improving adaptation capacity. Experimental results show our DKUA outperforms
the existing methods by 7.6%/5.3% average mAP/R@1 improvement on
anti-forgetting and generalization capacity, respectively. Our code will be
publicly released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 组织样本通常大于标准显微镜载玻片，需要拼接多片段以分析完整结构（如肿瘤）。现有方法因组织损失、形态变形等问题受限。

Method: 利用视觉病理学基础模型的潜在特征表示识别相邻区域，通过大量语义匹配候选进行稳健姿态估计，形成全载玻片拼接。

Result: 在三个病理学数据集上的实验表明，SemanticStitcher在边界匹配上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SemanticStitcher为病理学中的自动拼接提供了更稳健的解决方案。

Abstract: In histopathology, tissue samples are often larger than a standard microscope
slide, making stitching of multiple fragments necessary to process entire
structures such as tumors. Automated stitching is a prerequisite for scaling
analysis, but is challenging due to possible tissue loss during preparation,
inhomogeneous morphological distortion, staining inconsistencies, missing
regions due to misalignment on the slide, or frayed tissue edges. This limits
state-of-the-art stitching methods using boundary shape matching algorithms to
reconstruct artificial whole mount slides (WMS). Here, we introduce
SemanticStitcher using latent feature representations derived from a visual
histopathology foundation model to identify neighboring areas in different
fragments. Robust pose estimation based on a large number of semantic matching
candidates derives a mosaic of multiple fragments to form the WMS. Experiments
on three different histopathology datasets demonstrate that SemanticStitcher
yields robust WMS mosaicing and consistently outperforms the state of the art
in correct boundary matches.

Result: 实验证明CoEmoGen在情感忠实度和语义一致性上表现优越，并构建了大规模情感艺术数据集EmoArt。

Conclusion: CoEmoGen为情感图像生成提供了高效、可扩展的解决方案，推动了情感驱动艺术创作的发展。

Abstract: Emotional Image Content Generation (EICG) aims to generate semantically clear
and emotionally faithful images based on given emotion categories, with broad
application prospects. While recent text-to-image diffusion models excel at
generating concrete concepts, they struggle with the complexity of abstract
emotions. There have also emerged methods specifically designed for EICG, but
they excessively rely on word-level attribute labels for guidance, which suffer
from semantic incoherence, ambiguity, and limited scalability. To address these
challenges, we propose CoEmoGen, a novel pipeline notable for its semantic
coherence and high scalability. Specifically, leveraging multimodal large
language models (MLLMs), we construct high-quality captions focused on
emotion-triggering content for context-rich semantic guidance. Furthermore,
inspired by psychological insights, we design a Hierarchical Low-Rank
Adaptation (HiLoRA) module to cohesively model both polarity-shared low-level
features and emotion-specific high-level semantics. Extensive experiments
demonstrate CoEmoGen's superiority in emotional faithfulness and semantic
coherence from quantitative, qualitative, and user study perspectives. To
intuitively showcase scalability, we curate EmoArt, a large-scale dataset of
emotionally evocative artistic images, providing endless inspiration for
emotion-driven artistic creation. The dataset and code are available at

Abstract: Retinal microvascular imaging is increasingly recognised as a non invasive
method for evaluating systemic vascular and metabolic health. However, the
association between lipidomics and retinal vasculature remains inadequate. This
study investigates the relationships between serum lipid subclasses, free fatty
acids (FA), diacylglycerols (DAG), triacylglycerols (TAG), and cholesteryl
esters (CE), and retinal microvascular characteristics in a large
population-based cohort. Using Spearman correlation analysis, we examined the
interconnection between lipid subclasses and ten retinal microvascular traits,
applying the Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate (BH-FDR) to adjust for
statistical significance.
  Results indicated that FA were linked to retinal vessel twistiness, while CE
correlated with the average widths of arteries and veins. Conversely, DAG and
TAG showed negative correlations with the width and complexity of arterioles
and venules. These findings suggest that retinal vascular architecture reflects
distinct circulating lipid profiles, supporting its role as a non-invasive
marker of systemic metabolic health. This study is the first to integrate deep
learning (DL)derived retinal traits with lipidomic subclasses in a healthy
cohort, thereby providing insights into microvascular structural changes
independent of disease status or treatment effects.

Abstract: Despite substantial progress in anomaly synthesis methods, existing
diffusion-based and coarse inpainting pipelines commonly suffer from structural
deficiencies such as micro-structural discontinuities, limited semantic
controllability, and inefficient generation. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce ARAS, a language-conditioned, auto-regressive anomaly synthesis
approach that precisely injects local, text-specified defects into normal
images via token-anchored latent editing. Leveraging a hard-gated
auto-regressive operator and a training-free, context-preserving masked
sampling kernel, ARAS significantly enhances defect realism, preserves
fine-grained material textures, and provides continuous semantic control over
synthesized anomalies. Integrated within our Quality-Aware Re-weighted Anomaly
Detection (QARAD) framework, we further propose a dynamic weighting strategy
that emphasizes high-quality synthetic samples by computing an image-text
similarity score with a dual-encoder model. Extensive experiments across three
benchmark datasets-MVTec AD, VisA, and BTAD, demonstrate that our QARAD
outperforms SOTA methods in both image- and pixel-level anomaly detection
tasks, achieving improved accuracy, robustness, and a 5 times synthesis speedup
compared to diffusion-based alternatives. Our complete code and synthesized
dataset will be publicly available.

Result: 在MathSpeech基准测试中CER为28%，在S2L-equations基准测试中显著优于MathSpeech模型（27% vs. 64%）。

Conclusion: 该研究为多模态AI在数学内容识别领域的未来进展奠定了基础。

Abstract: Conversion of spoken mathematical expressions is a challenging task that
involves transcribing speech into a strictly structured symbolic representation
while addressing the ambiguity inherent in the pronunciation of equations.
Although significant progress has been achieved in automatic speech recognition
(ASR) and language models (LM), the problem of converting spoken mathematics
into LaTeX remains underexplored. This task directly applies to educational and
research domains, such as lecture transcription or note creation. Based on ASR
post-correction, prior work requires 2 transcriptions, focuses only on isolated
equations, has a limited test set, and provides neither training data nor
multilingual coverage. To address these issues, we present the first fully
open-source large-scale dataset, comprising over 66,000 human-annotated audio
samples of mathematical equations and sentences in both English and Russian,
drawn from diverse scientific domains. In addition to the ASR post-correction
models and few-shot prompting, we apply audio language models, demonstrating
comparable character error rate (CER) results on the MathSpeech benchmark (28%
vs. 30%) for the equations conversion. In contrast, on the proposed
S2L-equations benchmark, our models outperform the MathSpeech model by a
substantial margin of more than 40 percentage points, even after accounting for

TL;DR: 使用无人机和热成像技术估算奥地利东南部的野生动物密度，并与相机陷阱数据对比，结果显示无人机方法高效且可扩展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统野生动物密度估算方法（如捕获-再捕获、距离采样或相机陷阱）劳动密集或空间受限，无人机提供了一种高效、非侵入性的替代方案。

Method: 在无叶期使用无人机进行航测，结合热成像和RGB图像，采用三种密度外推方法（简单面积外推、自助法和零膨胀负二项模型），并与相机陷阱的随机相遇模型（REM）对比。

Result: 无人机方法估算的密度与REM相似，但通常更高，反映了白天开放和森林区域的活动差异。

Conclusion: 无人机为野生动物密度估算提供了一种有前景且可扩展的方法，但与传统方法视角不同。

Abstract: We use unmanned aerial drones to estimate wildlife density in southeastern
Austria and compare these estimates to camera trap data. Traditional methods
like capture-recapture, distance sampling, or camera traps are well-established
but labour-intensive or spatially constrained. Using thermal (IR) and RGB
imagery, drones enable efficient, non-intrusive animal counting. Our surveys
were conducted during the leafless period on single days in October and
November 2024 in three areas of a sub-Illyrian hill and terrace landscape.
Flight transects were based on predefined launch points using a 350 m grid and
an algorithm that defined the direction of systematically randomized transects.
This setup allowed surveying large areas in one day using multiple drones,
minimizing double counts. Flight altitude was set at 60 m to avoid disturbing
roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) while ensuring detection. Animals were manually
annotated in the recorded imagery and extrapolated to densities per square
kilometer. We applied three extrapolation methods with increasing complexity:
naive area-based extrapolation, bootstrapping, and zero-inflated negative
binomial modelling. For comparison, a Random Encounter Model (REM) estimate was
calculated using camera trap data from the flight period. The drone-based
methods yielded similar results, generally showing higher densities than REM,
except in one area in October. We hypothesize that drone-based density reflects
daytime activity in open and forested areas, while REM estimates average
activity over longer periods within forested zones. Although both approaches
estimate density, they offer different perspectives on wildlife presence. Our
results show that drones offer a promising, scalable method for wildlife
density estimation.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种超越模板匹配的迷因匹配方法，发现传统相似性度量在非模板迷因上效果不佳，但分段方法表现更好，并探索了多模态大语言模型的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有迷因匹配方法局限于模板背景，无法有效分析非模板迷因或链接到在线迷因词典，限制了自动化分析的广度和效果。

Method: 引入更广泛的迷因匹配定义，比较传统相似性度量（包括分段计算）和多模态大语言模型在迷因匹配中的表现。

Result: 传统方法在模板迷因上表现良好，但在非模板迷因上效果有限；分段方法优于全图度量；多模态大语言模型显示出潜力。

Conclusion: 准确匹配迷因的共享视觉元素（不仅是模板）仍是一个挑战，需要更先进的匹配技术。

Abstract: Internet memes, now a staple of digital communication, play a pivotal role in
how users engage within online communities and allow researchers to gain
insight into contemporary digital culture. These engaging user-generated
content are characterised by their reuse of visual elements also found in other
memes. Matching instances of memes via these shared visual elements, called
Meme Matching, is the basis of a wealth of meme analysis approaches. However,
most existing methods assume that every meme consists of a shared visual
background, called a Template, with some overlaid text, thereby limiting meme
matching to comparing the background image alone. Current approaches exclude
the many memes that are not template-based and limit the effectiveness of
automated meme analysis and would not be effective at linking memes to
contemporary web-based meme dictionaries. In this work, we introduce a broader
formulation of meme matching that extends beyond template matching. We show
that conventional similarity measures, including a novel segment-wise
computation of the similarity measures, excel at matching template-based memes
but fall short when applied to non-template-based meme formats. However, the
segment-wise approach was found to consistently outperform the whole-image
measures on matching non-template-based memes. Finally, we explore a
prompting-based approach using a pretrained Multimodal Large Language Model for
meme matching. Our results highlight that accurately matching memes via shared
visual elements, not just background templates, remains an open challenge that
requires more sophisticated matching techniques.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对农村历史地图的可扩展高效管道，通过分层机器学习方法提取建筑物足迹，验证了其高性能和效率，并发现了一个可能在大饥荒时期被废弃的定居点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 历史地图是研究过去景观和定居模式的重要资源，但现有方法多集中于城市且计算量大，难以适用于广阔的农村区域。

Method: 采用分层机器学习方法：先用CNN分类器过滤掉不太可能包含建筑物的区域，再用CNN分割算法处理剩余高概率区域提取建筑物特征。

Result: 验证了该方法在爱尔兰历史地图系列中的高性能和效率，并发现了一个可能在大饥荒时期被废弃的定居点。

Conclusion: 该方法为历史考古发现提供了高效工具，尤其适用于农村地区。

Abstract: Historical maps offer a valuable lens through which to study past landscapes
and settlement patterns. While prior research has leveraged machine learning
based techniques to extract building footprints from historical maps, such
approaches have largely focused on urban areas and tend to be computationally
intensive. This presents a challenge for research questions requiring analysis
across extensive rural regions, such as verifying historical census data or
locating abandoned settlements. In this paper, this limitation is addressed by
proposing a scalable and efficient pipeline tailored to rural maps with sparse
building distributions. The method described employs a hierarchical machine
learning based approach: convolutional neural network (CNN) classifiers are
first used to progressively filter out map sections unlikely to contain
buildings, significantly reducing the area requiring detailed analysis. The
remaining high probability sections are then processed using CNN segmentation
algorithms to extract building features. The pipeline is validated using test
sections from the Ordnance Survey Ireland historical 25 inch map series and 6
inch map series, demonstrating both high performance and improved efficiency
compared to conventional segmentation-only approaches. Application of the
technique to both map series, covering the same geographic region, highlights
its potential for historical and archaeological discovery. Notably, the
pipeline identified a settlement of approximately 22 buildings in Tully, Co.
Galway, present in the 6 inch map, produced in 1839, but absent from the 25
inch map, produced in 1899, suggesting it may have been abandoned during the
Great Famine period.

Motivation: 现有方法在增强SAM2的泛化能力和性能方面仍有挑战，需要更强大的编码器。

Method: 提出SAM2-UNeXT框架，结合DINOv2编码器、双分辨率策略和密集粘合层，简化解码器设计。

Result: 在四个基准测试中表现优异，包括二分图像分割、伪装目标检测等。

Conclusion: SAM2-UNeXT通过简单架构实现了更准确的分割，性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: Recent studies have highlighted the potential of adapting the Segment
Anything Model (SAM) for various downstream tasks. However, constructing a more
powerful and generalizable encoder to further enhance performance remains an
open challenge. In this work, we propose SAM2-UNeXT, an advanced framework that
builds upon the core principles of SAM2-UNet while extending the
representational capacity of SAM2 through the integration of an auxiliary
DINOv2 encoder. By incorporating a dual-resolution strategy and a dense glue
layer, our approach enables more accurate segmentation with a simple
architecture, relaxing the need for complex decoder designs. Extensive
experiments conducted on four benchmarks, including dichotomous image
segmentation, camouflaged object detection, marine animal segmentation, and
remote sensing saliency detection, demonstrate the superior performance of our
proposed method. The code is available at

TL;DR: RadProPoser是一种基于雷达的隐私保护人体姿态估计系统，通过概率编码-解码架构处理复杂雷达数据，预测三维关节位置及不确定性，并在新数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 雷达姿态估计具有隐私保护和光照不变性优势，但受噪声和多路径效应影响，需解决其不确定性建模问题。

Method: 采用概率编码-解码架构，结合变分推断处理雷达数据，预测关节位置及不确定性，支持高斯和拉普拉斯分布建模。

Result: 在光学动作捕捉数据集上，平均关节位置误差为6.425 cm，不确定性校准误差低至0.021，数据增强提升下游任务性能。

Conclusion: RadProPoser首次实现端到端雷达姿态估计及不确定性量化，为可靠的人体运动分析奠定基础。

Abstract: Radar-based human pose estimation (HPE) provides a privacy-preserving,
illumination-invariant sensing modality but is challenged by noisy,
multipath-affected measurements. We introduce RadProPoser, a probabilistic
encoder-decoder architecture that processes complex-valued radar tensors from a
compact 3-transmitter, 4-receiver MIMO radar. By incorporating variational
inference into keypoint regression, RadProPoser jointly predicts 26
three-dimensional joint locations alongside heteroscedastic aleatoric
uncertainties and can be recalibrated to predict total uncertainty. We explore
different probabilistic formulations using both Gaussian and Laplace
distributions for latent priors and likelihoods. On our newly released dataset
with optical motion-capture ground truth, RadProPoser achieves an overall mean
per-joint position error (MPJPE) of 6.425 cm, with 5.678 cm at the 45 degree
aspect angle. The learned uncertainties exhibit strong alignment with actual
pose errors and can be calibrated to produce reliable prediction intervals,
with our best configuration achieving an expected calibration error of 0.021.
As an additional demonstration, sampling from these latent distributions
enables effective data augmentation for downstream activity classification,
resulting in an F1 score of 0.870. To our knowledge, this is the first
end-to-end radar tensor-based HPE system to explicitly model and quantify
per-joint uncertainty from raw radar tensor data, establishing a foundation for
explainable and reliable human motion analysis in radar applications.

Motivation: 传统内窥镜受限于毫米级厚度的物理约束，而金属透镜（微米级）为超微成像提供了新解决方案，但其数据获取和算法研究存在空白。

Method: 论文首先建立了金属透镜内窥镜数据集并进行了光学模拟，随后提出了MetaScope网络，包含光学驱动的强度调整（OIA）和色差校正（OCC）模块，并通过梯度引导蒸馏增强联合学习。

Result: 实验表明，MetaScope在金属透镜分割和恢复任务中优于现有方法，并在真实生物医学场景中表现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: MetaScope通过光学驱动的神经网络设计，成功填补了金属透镜内窥镜的研究空白，为超微成像提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Miniaturized endoscopy has advanced accurate visual perception within the
human body. Prevailing research remains limited to conventional cameras
employing convex lenses, where the physical constraints with millimetre-scale
thickness impose serious impediments on the micro-level clinical. Recently,
with the emergence of meta-optics, ultra-micro imaging based on metalenses
(micron-scale) has garnered great attention, serving as a promising solution.
However, due to the physical difference of metalens, there is a large gap in
data acquisition and algorithm research. In light of this, we aim to bridge
this unexplored gap, advancing the novel metalens endoscopy. First, we
establish datasets for metalens endoscopy and conduct preliminary optical
simulation, identifying two derived optical issues that physically adhere to
strong optical priors. Second, we propose MetaScope, a novel optics-driven
neural network tailored for metalens endoscopy driven by physical optics.
MetaScope comprises two novel designs: Optics-informed Intensity Adjustment
(OIA), rectifying intensity decay by learning optical embeddings, and
Optics-informed Chromatic Correction (OCC), mitigating chromatic aberration by
learning spatial deformations informed by learned Point Spread Function (PSF)
distributions. To enhance joint learning, we further deploy a gradient-guided
distillation to transfer knowledge from the foundational model adaptively.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MetaScope not only outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in both metalens segmentation and restoration but also
achieves impressive generalized ability in real biomedical scenes.

Motivation: 静态融合启发式和类别无关注意力在动态场景（如遮挡、杂乱和类别不平衡）中表现受限。

Method: DyCAF-Net提出三种创新：输入条件平衡颈部、双动态注意力机制和类别感知特征适应。

Result: 在13个基准测试中显著提升了精度和mAP，同时保持计算效率和推理速度。

Conclusion: DyCAF-Net因其适应性强，成为医学影像、监控和自动驾驶等实际任务的稳健解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in object detection rely on modular architectures with
multi-scale fusion and attention mechanisms. However, static fusion heuristics
and class-agnostic attention limit performance in dynamic scenes with
occlusions, clutter, and class imbalance. We introduce Dynamic Class-Aware
Fusion Network (DyCAF-Net) that addresses these challenges through three
innovations: (1) an input-conditioned equilibrium-based neck that iteratively
refines multi-scale features via implicit fixed-point modeling, (2) a dual
dynamic attention mechanism that adaptively recalibrates channel and spatial
responses using input- and class-dependent cues, and (3) class-aware feature
adaptation that modulates features to prioritize discriminative regions for
rare classes. Through comprehensive ablation studies with YOLOv8 and related
architectures, alongside benchmarking against nine state-of-the-art baselines,
DyCAF-Net achieves significant improvements in precision, mAP@50, and mAP@50-95
across 13 diverse benchmarks, including occlusion-heavy and long-tailed
datasets. The framework maintains computational efficiency ($\sim$11.1M
parameters) and competitive inference speeds, while its adaptability to scale
variance, semantic overlaps, and class imbalance positions it as a robust
solution for real-world detection tasks in medical imaging, surveillance, and
autonomous systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 云层和夜间条件限制了多光谱卫星图像的可用性，而Sentinel-1雷达数据不受这些条件影响。

Method: 采用基于条件潜在流匹配的多阶段训练方法，并首次将余弦调度与流匹配结合。

Result: CloudBreaker在生成光学图像上表现出色（FID为0.7432），NDVI和NDWI的结构相似性指数（SSIM）分别为0.6874和0.6156。

Conclusion: CloudBreaker为多光谱数据不可靠的遥感应用提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Cloud cover and nighttime conditions remain significant limitations in
satellite-based remote sensing, often restricting the availability and
usability of multi-spectral imagery. In contrast, Sentinel-1 radar images are
unaffected by cloud cover and can provide consistent data regardless of weather
or lighting conditions. To address the challenges of limited satellite imagery,
we propose CloudBreaker, a novel framework that generates high-quality
multi-spectral Sentinel-2 signals from Sentinel-1 data. This includes the
reconstruction of optical (RGB) images as well as critical vegetation and water
indices such as NDVI and NDWI.We employed a novel multi-stage training approach
based on conditional latent flow matching and, to the best of our knowledge,
are the first to integrate cosine scheduling with flow matching. CloudBreaker
demonstrates strong performance, achieving a Frechet Inception Distance (FID)
score of 0.7432, indicating high fidelity and realism in the generated optical
imagery. The model also achieved Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) of
0.6156 for NDWI and 0.6874 for NDVI, indicating a high degree of structural
similarity. This establishes CloudBreaker as a promising solution for a wide
range of remote sensing applications where multi-spectral data is typically
unavailable or unreliable

Result: 在e-CK+数据库上达到93.6%的识别率，比现有方法提升25.9%以上。

Conclusion: evTransFER框架显著提升了事件相机在表情识别中的性能，证明了迁移学习和时空动态建模的有效性。

Abstract: Event-based cameras are bio-inspired vision sensors that asynchronously
capture per-pixel intensity changes with microsecond latency, high temporal
resolution, and high dynamic range, providing valuable information about the
spatio-temporal dynamics of the scene. In the present work, we propose
evTransFER, a transfer learning-based framework and architecture for face
expression recognition using event-based cameras. The main contribution is a
feature extractor designed to encode the spatio-temporal dynamics of faces,
built by training an adversarial generative method on a different problem
(facial reconstruction) and then transferring the trained encoder weights to
the face expression recognition system. We show that this proposed transfer
learning method greatly improves the ability to recognize facial expressions
compared to training a network from scratch. In addition, we propose an
architecture that incorporates an LSTM to capture longer-term facial expression
dynamics, and we introduce a new event-based representation, referred to as
TIE, both of which further improve the results. We evaluate the proposed
framework on the event-based facial expression database e-CK+ and compare it to
state-of-the-art methods. The results show that the proposed framework
evTransFER achieves a 93.6\% recognition rate on the e-CK+ database,
significantly improving the accuracy (25.9\% points or more) when compared to
state-of-the-art performance for similar problems.

Abstract: We introduce FPG-NAS, a FLOPs-aware Gated Differentiable Neural Architecture
Search framework for efficient 6DoF object pose estimation. Estimating 3D
rotation and translation from a single image has been widely investigated yet
remains computationally demanding, limiting applicability in
resource-constrained scenarios. FPG-NAS addresses this by proposing a
specialized differentiable NAS approach for 6DoF pose estimation, featuring a
task-specific search space and a differentiable gating mechanism that enables
discrete multi-candidate operator selection, thus improving architectural
diversity. Additionally, a FLOPs regularization term ensures a balanced
trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. The framework explores a vast search
space of approximately 10\textsuperscript{92} possible architectures.
Experiments on the LINEMOD and SPEED+ datasets demonstrate that FPG-NAS-derived
models outperform previous methods under strict FLOPs constraints. To the best
of our knowledge, FPG-NAS is the first differentiable NAS framework
specifically designed for 6DoF object pose estimation.

Abstract: Reconstructing and semantically interpreting 3D scenes from sparse 2D views
remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision. Conventional methods often
decouple semantic understanding from reconstruction or necessitate costly
per-scene optimization, thereby restricting their scalability and
generalizability. In this paper, we introduce Uni3R, a novel feed-forward
framework that jointly reconstructs a unified 3D scene representation enriched
with open-vocabulary semantics, directly from unposed multi-view images. Our
approach leverages a Cross-View Transformer to robustly integrate information
across arbitrary multi-view inputs, which then regresses a set of 3D Gaussian
primitives endowed with semantic feature fields. This unified representation
facilitates high-fidelity novel view synthesis, open-vocabulary 3D semantic
segmentation, and depth prediction, all within a single, feed-forward pass.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that Uni3R establishes a new state-of-the-art
across multiple benchmarks, including 25.07 PSNR on RE10K and 55.84 mIoU on
ScanNet. Our work signifies a novel paradigm towards generalizable, unified 3D

Motivation: 现有方法在短片段生成中有效，但在长视频生成中存在时间不一致和视觉退化问题，需要解决这些挑战。

Method: 提出LongVie框架，包括统一噪声初始化、全局控制信号归一化、多模态控制框架和退化感知训练策略。

Result: LongVie在长范围可控性、一致性和质量上达到最优性能，并通过LongVGenBench验证。

Conclusion: LongVie为可控超长视频生成提供了有效解决方案，显著提升了生成质量与一致性。

Abstract: Controllable ultra-long video generation is a fundamental yet challenging
task. Although existing methods are effective for short clips, they struggle to
scale due to issues such as temporal inconsistency and visual degradation. In
this paper, we initially investigate and identify three key factors: separate
noise initialization, independent control signal normalization, and the
limitations of single-modality guidance. To address these issues, we propose
LongVie, an end-to-end autoregressive framework for controllable long video
generation. LongVie introduces two core designs to ensure temporal consistency:
1) a unified noise initialization strategy that maintains consistent generation
across clips, and 2) global control signal normalization that enforces
alignment in the control space throughout the entire video. To mitigate visual
degradation, LongVie employs 3) a multi-modal control framework that integrates
both dense (e.g., depth maps) and sparse (e.g., keypoints) control signals,
complemented by 4) a degradation-aware training strategy that adaptively
balances modality contributions over time to preserve visual quality. We also
introduce LongVGenBench, a comprehensive benchmark consisting of 100
high-resolution videos spanning diverse real-world and synthetic environments,
each lasting over one minute. Extensive experiments show that LongVie achieves
state-of-the-art performance in long-range controllability, consistency, and
quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频理解需要有效建模运动和外观信息，尤其在少样本动作识别中。现有方法在点跟踪方面有进展，但仍面临选择信息点和建模运动模式的挑战。

Method: 提出语义感知采样策略和运动建模框架，结合轨迹标记与语义特征。

Result: 在六个少样本动作识别基准测试中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: Trokens通过结合语义和运动信息，显著提升了动作识别效果。

Abstract: Video understanding requires effective modeling of both motion and appearance
information, particularly for few-shot action recognition. While recent
advances in point tracking have been shown to improve few-shot action
recognition, two fundamental challenges persist: selecting informative points
to track and effectively modeling their motion patterns. We present Trokens, a
novel approach that transforms trajectory points into semantic-aware relational
tokens for action recognition. First, we introduce a semantic-aware sampling
strategy to adaptively distribute tracking points based on object scale and
semantic relevance. Second, we develop a motion modeling framework that
captures both intra-trajectory dynamics through the Histogram of Oriented
Displacements (HoD) and inter-trajectory relationships to model complex action
patterns. Our approach effectively combines these trajectory tokens with
semantic features to enhance appearance features with motion information,
achieving state-of-the-art performance across six diverse few-shot action
recognition benchmarks: Something-Something-V2 (both full and small splits),
Kinetics, UCF101, HMDB51, and FineGym. For project page see

*Mohamed Irfan Refai,Abdulaziz Y. Alkayas,Anup Teejo Mathew,Federico Renda,Thomas George Thuruthel*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于图像和学习的框架，用于估计手指外骨骼系统的分布式接触力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 软性可穿戴辅助设备的非线性与柔顺性使得物理建模和嵌入式传感具有挑战性，需要一种新方法来捕捉动态辅助的传递。

Method: 使用SoRoSim工具箱生成多样化的外骨骼几何和驱动场景数据集，通过低分辨率灰度图像训练学习模型。

Result: 模型能准确估计多接触点的交互力，泛化能力强，对视觉噪声和对比度变化具有鲁棒性，并成功集成到反馈控制器中。

Conclusion: 该方法可作为实时力估计的非侵入性替代方案，适用于外骨骼的闭环控制。

Abstract: Wearable assistive devices are increasingly becoming softer. Modelling their
interface with human tissue is necessary to capture transmission of dynamic
assistance. However, their nonlinear and compliant nature makes both physical
modeling and embedded sensing challenging. In this paper, we develop a
image-based, learning-based framework to estimate distributed contact forces
for a finger-exosuit system. We used the SoRoSim toolbox to generate a diverse
dataset of exosuit geometries and actuation scenarios for training. The method
accurately estimated interaction forces across multiple contact locations from
low-resolution grayscale images, was able to generalize to unseen shapes and
actuation levels, and remained robust under visual noise and contrast
variations. We integrated the model into a feedback controller, and found that
the vision-based estimator functions as a surrogate force sensor for
closed-loop control. This approach could be used as a non-intrusive alternative
for real-time force estimation for exosuits.

### [131] [Tunable Leg Stiffness in a Monopedal Hopper for Energy-Efficient Vertical Hopping Across Varying Ground Profiles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02873)
*Rongqian Chen,Jun Kwon,Kefan Wu,Wei-Hsi Chen*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: HASTA是一种具有实时可调腿部刚度的垂直跳跃机器人，旨在通过调整刚度优化不同地面条件下的能量效率。实验和模拟验证了可调刚度对能量高效跳跃的促进作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究目标是优化垂直跳跃机器人在不同地面条件下的能量效率，通过调整腿部刚度实现最大跳跃高度。

Method: 设计并实现HASTA机器人，通过实验和模拟测试不同地面刚度与阻尼条件下的最佳腿部刚度选择。

Result: 实验支持假设：较软的腿在软阻尼地面表现更好，较硬的腿在硬低阻尼地面更优。可调刚度显著提升能量效率。

Conclusion: 可调腿部刚度能有效优化跳跃机器人的能量效率，为未来控制器开发提供参考。

Abstract: We present the design and implementation of HASTA (Hopper with Adjustable
Stiffness for Terrain Adaptation), a vertical hopping robot with real-time
tunable leg stiffness, aimed at optimizing energy efficiency across various
ground profiles (a pair of ground stiffness and damping conditions). By
adjusting leg stiffness, we aim to maximize apex hopping height, a key metric
for energy-efficient vertical hopping. We hypothesize that softer legs perform
better on soft, damped ground by minimizing penetration and energy loss, while
stiffer legs excel on hard, less damped ground by reducing limb deformation and
energy dissipation. Through experimental tests and simulations, we find the
best leg stiffness within our selection for each combination of ground
stiffness and damping, enabling the robot to achieve maximum steady-state
hopping height with a constant energy input. These results support our
hypothesis that tunable stiffness improves energy-efficient locomotion in
controlled experimental conditions. In addition, the simulation provides
insights that could aid in the future development of controllers for selecting
leg stiffness.

*Isobel Voysey,Lynne Baillie,Joanne Williams,Michael Herrmann*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何通过定制化机器人帮助儿童学习动物行为，促进安全互动，并通过参与式设计工作坊收集了教育者和儿童的需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动物福利教育需要定制化机器人来帮助儿童学习动物行为，促进安全互动。

Method: 通过参与式设计工作坊，收集教育者和儿童对机器人外观、行为和功能的需求。

Result: 研究发现机器人需具备自然外观、毛绒质感，并通过面部和尾巴表达动物状态；提出了新的参与式设计活动。

Conclusion: 研究为动物福利教育机器人设计提供了关键需求，并展示了参与式设计的挑战与潜力。

Abstract: Animal welfare education could greatly benefit from customized robots to help
children learn about animals and their behavior, and thereby promote positive,
safe child-animal interactions. To this end, we ran Participatory Design
workshops with animal welfare educators and children to identify key
requirements for zoomorphic robots from their perspectives. Our findings
encompass a zoomorphic robot's appearance, behavior, and features, as well as
concepts for a narrative surrounding the robot. Through comparing and
contrasting the two groups, we find the importance of: negative reactions to
undesirable behavior from children; using the facial features and tail to
provide cues signaling an animal's internal state; and a natural, furry
appearance and texture. We also contribute some novel activities for
Participatory Design with children, including branching storyboards inspired by
thematic apperception tests and interactive narratives, and reflect on some of
the key design challenges of achieving consensus between the groups, despite
much overlap in their design concepts.

### [133] [Context-aware Risk Assessment and Its Application in Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02919)
*Boyang Tian,Weisong Shi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种轻量级模块化框架CRI，用于实时量化方向性风险并动态调整控制命令，显著提升了自动驾驶的安全性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有风险评估方法要么输出粗糙的场景级指标缺乏可解释性，要么未具体集成到自动驾驶系统中，或仅针对特定驾驶场景。

Method: CRI基于物体运动学和空间关系，采用方向感知空间分区、混合概率-最大融合策略和自适应控制策略。

Result: 在220个安全关键场景中，CRI显著减少了碰撞率（19%）、提升了驾驶评分（17%），且运行时开销极低（3.6毫秒）。

Conclusion: CRI在复杂高风险环境中显著提升了安全性和鲁棒性，同时保持了模块化和低运行时开销。

Abstract: Ensuring safety in autonomous driving requires precise, real-time risk
assessment and adaptive behavior. Prior work on risk estimation either outputs
coarse, global scene-level metrics lacking interpretability, proposes
indicators without concrete integration into autonomous systems, or focuses
narrowly on specific driving scenarios. We introduce the Context-aware Risk
Index (CRI), a light-weight modular framework that quantifies directional risks
based on object kinematics and spatial relationships, dynamically adjusting
control commands in real time. CRI employs direction-aware spatial partitioning
within a dynamic safety envelope using Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS)
principles, a hybrid probabilistic-max fusion strategy for risk aggregation,
and an adaptive control policy for real-time behavior modulation. We evaluate
CRI on the Bench2Drive benchmark comprising 220 safety-critical scenarios using
a state-of-the-art end-to-end model Transfuser++ on challenging routes. Our
collision-rate metrics show a 19\% reduction (p = 0.003) in vehicle collisions
per failed route, a 20\% reduction (p = 0.004) in collisions per kilometer, a
17\% increase (p = 0.016) in composed driving score, and a statistically
significant reduction in penalty scores (p = 0.013) with very low overhead (3.6
ms per decision cycle). These results demonstrate that CRI substantially
improves safety and robustness in complex, risk-intensive environments while
maintaining modularity and low runtime overhead.

*Zenan Zhu,Wenxi Chen,Pei-Chun Kao,Janelle Clark,Lily Behnke,Rebecca Kramer-Bottiglio,Holly Yanco,Yan Gu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于MAML的框架，用于通过少量织物传感器准确估计步态和地形，适应性强且泛化能力高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决织物传感器因非线性特性和数据不足导致的步态和地形估计难题。

Method: 结合MAML和深度学习，学习通用模型初始化，快速适应新用户和地形。

Result: 在9名参与者上测试，表现优于基线方法，准确性和泛化能力更强。

Conclusion: 该框架在步态和地形估计中具有高效适应性和强泛化能力。

Abstract: This letter presents a model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) based framework
for simultaneous and accurate estimation of human gait phase and terrain
geometry using a small set of fabric-based wearable soft sensors, with
efficient adaptation to unseen subjects and strong generalization across
different subjects and terrains. Compared to rigid alternatives such as
inertial measurement units, fabric-based soft sensors improve comfort but
introduce nonlinearities due to hysteresis, placement error, and fabric
deformation. Moreover, inter-subject and inter-terrain variability, coupled
with limited calibration data in real-world deployments, further complicate
accurate estimation. To address these challenges, the proposed framework
integrates MAML into a deep learning architecture to learn a generalizable
model initialization that captures subject- and terrain-invariant structure.
This initialization enables efficient adaptation (i.e., adaptation with only a
small amount of calibration data and a few fine-tuning steps) to new users,
while maintaining strong generalization (i.e., high estimation accuracy across
subjects and terrains). Experiments on nine participants walking at various
speeds over five terrain conditions demonstrate that the proposed framework
outperforms baseline approaches in estimating gait phase, locomotion mode, and
incline angle, with superior accuracy, adaptation efficiency, and
generalization.

Result: 模型预测气溶胶浓度动态的误差在35秒内，实时干预策略优于静态过滤器。

Conclusion: AeroSafe系统能有效降低空气传播病原体风险，适用于医疗和公共场所。

Abstract: Indoor air quality plays an essential role in the safety and well-being of
occupants, especially in the context of airborne diseases. This paper
introduces AeroSafe, a novel approach aimed at enhancing the efficacy of indoor
air purification systems through a robotic cough emulator testbed and a
digital-twins-based aerosol residence time analysis. Current portable air
filters often overlook the concentrations of respiratory aerosols generated by
coughs, posing a risk, particularly in high-exposure environments like
healthcare facilities and public spaces. To address this gap, we present a
robotic dual-agent physical emulator comprising a maneuverable mannequin
simulating cough events and a portable air purifier autonomously responding to
aerosols. The generated data from this emulator trains a digital twins model,
combining a physics-based compartment model with a machine learning approach,
using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and graph convolution layers.
Experimental results demonstrate the model's ability to predict aerosol
concentration dynamics with a mean residence time prediction error within 35
seconds. The proposed system's real-time intervention strategies outperform
static air filter placement, showcasing its potential in mitigating airborne
pathogen risks.

Method: 开发了一种移动机械臂系统，通过摄像头和近红外光谱传感器实时检测和化学分析微塑料。

Result: 实验表明，该系统在操控精度和微塑料分类准确性上表现优异。

Conclusion: 该机器人平台为解决微塑料污染问题提供了一种高效的技术手段。

Abstract: Microplastics, defined as plastic particles smaller than 5 millimeters, have
become a pervasive environmental contaminant that accumulates on beaches due to
wind patterns and tidal forcing. Detecting microplastics and mapping their
concentration in the wild remains one of the primary challenges in addressing
this environmental issue. This paper introduces a novel robotic platform that
automatically detects and chemically analyzes microplastics on beach surfaces.
This mobile manipulator system scans areas for microplastics using a camera
mounted on the robotic arm's end effector. The system effectively segments
candidate microplastic particles on sand surfaces even in the presence of
organic matter such as leaves and clams. Once a candidate microplastic particle
is detected, the system steers a near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopic sensor onto
the particle using both NIR and visual feedback to chemically analyze it in
real-time. Through experiments in lab and beach environments, the system is
shown to achieve an excellent positional precision in manipulation control and
high microplastic classification accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究要么忽略蛇形机器人运动的复杂性，要么过于关注复杂交互（如挖掘运动），而缺乏基于简单刚性动力学的中间范式模型。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Result: 模型成功解决了蛇形机器人运动中的接触和控制分配问题，仿真和实验验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 本文提出的简化动力学模型为蛇形机器人运动控制提供了新思路，并通过实验验证了其可行性。

Abstract: Contact-rich problems, such as snake robot locomotion, offer unexplored yet
rich opportunities for optimization-based trajectory and acyclic contact
planning. So far, a substantial body of control research has focused on
emulating snake locomotion and replicating its distinctive movement patterns
using shape functions that either ignore the complexity of interactions or
focus on complex interactions with matter (e.g., burrowing movements). However,
models and control frameworks that lie in between these two paradigms and are
based on simple, fundamental rigid body dynamics, which alleviate the
challenging contact and control allocation problems in snake locomotion, remain
absent. This work makes meaningful contributions, substantiated by simulations
and experiments, in the following directions: 1) introducing a reduced-order
model based on Moreau's stepping-forward approach from differential inclusion
mathematics, 2) verifying model accuracy, 3) experimental validation.

Motivation: 探索AI在自主机器人设计和开发中的应用潜力，尤其是通过LLMs和混合推理模型生成无人机控制系统。

Method: 利用AI模型生成实时、自托管的无人机控制平台代码，部署于真实和模拟无人机，并通过Web界面管理。

Abstract: Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) including large language models
(LLMs) and hybrid reasoning models present an opportunity to reimagine how
autonomous robots such as drones are designed, developed, and validated. Here,
we demonstrate a fully AI-generated drone control system: with minimal human
input, an artificial intelligence (AI) model authored all the code for a
real-time, self-hosted drone command and control platform, which was deployed
and demonstrated on a real drone in flight as well as a simulated virtual drone
in the cloud. The system enables real-time mapping, flight telemetry,
autonomous mission planning and execution, and safety protocolsall orchestrated
through a web interface hosted directly on the drone itself. Not a single line
of code was written by a human. We quantitatively benchmark system performance,
code complexity, and development speed against prior, human-coded
architectures, finding that AI-generated code can deliver functionally complete
command-and-control stacks at orders-of-magnitude faster development cycles,
though with identifiable current limitations related to specific model context
window and reasoning depth. Our analysis uncovers the practical boundaries of
AI-driven robot control code generation at current model scales, as well as
emergent strengths and failure modes in AI-generated robotics code. This work
sets a precedent for the autonomous creation of robot control systems and, more
broadly, suggests a new paradigm for robotics engineeringone in which future
robots may be largely co-designed, developed, and verified by artificial
intelligence. In this initial work, a robot built a robot's brain.

Result: 在仿真和实际场景中验证，方法在训练效率、规划时间、轨迹长度和成功率上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法高效、通用性强，适用于复杂环境中的物体操作任务。

Abstract: Object manipulation skills are necessary for robots operating in various
daily-life scenarios, ranging from warehouses to hospitals. They allow the
robots to manipulate the given object to their desired arrangement in the
cluttered environment. The existing approaches to solving object manipulations
are either inefficient sampling based techniques, require expert
demonstrations, or learn by trial and error, making them less ideal for
practical scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel, multimodal
physics-informed neural network (PINN) for solving object manipulation tasks.
Our approach efficiently learns to solve the Eikonal equation without expert
data and finds object manipulation trajectories fast in complex, cluttered
environments. Our method is multimodal as it also reactively replans the
robot's grasps during manipulation to achieve the desired object poses. We
demonstrate our approach in both simulation and real-world scenarios and
compare it against state-of-the-art baseline methods. The results indicate that
our approach is effective across various objects, has efficient training
compared to previous learning-based methods, and demonstrates high performance
in planning time, trajectory length, and success rates. Our demonstration
videos can be found at https://youtu.be/FaQLkTV9knI.

Result: 通过真实实验和用户研究验证了框架的有效性，能够理解人类偏好并完成任务。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了人机物体交接的自然性和流畅性，适用于日常生活中的多种场景。

Abstract: Human-robot object handover is a crucial element for assistive robots that
aim to help people in their daily lives, including elderly care, hospitals, and
factory floors. The existing approaches to solving these tasks rely on
pre-selected target objects and do not contextualize human implicit and
explicit preferences for handover, limiting natural and smooth interaction
between humans and robots. These preferences can be related to the target
object selection from the cluttered environment and to the way the robot should
grasp the selected object to facilitate desirable human grasping during
handovers. Therefore, this paper presents a unified approach that selects
target distant objects using human verbal and non-verbal commands and performs
the handover operation by contextualizing human implicit and explicit
preferences to generate robot grasps and compliant handover motion sequences.
We evaluate our integrated framework and its components through real-world
experiments and user studies with arbitrary daily-life objects. The results of
these evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed pipeline in
handling object handover tasks by understanding human preferences. Our
demonstration videos can be found at https://youtu.be/6z27B2INl-s.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文研究了两种方法（基于物理的观测器和神经网络回归模型）用于估算仿蝙蝠扑翼机器人Aerobat的气动力，目标是为闭环飞行控制提供支持。两种方法在实验中表现出良好的一致性。


<details>

Motivation: 精确估算气动力对扑翼机器人的控制、建模和设计至关重要，尤其是具有动态变形能力的机器人。

Method: 1. 基于哈密顿力学的物理观测器，利用共轭动量概念估算气动力；2. 多层感知器（MLP）神经网络回归模型，从关节运动学、扑翼频率和环境参数映射到气动力输出。

Result: 两种方法在三个力分量（Fx、Fy、Fz）上表现出强一致性。

Conclusion: 两种方法均有效，为扑翼机器人的闭环控制提供了可靠的气动力估算方案。

Abstract: Accurate estimation of aerodynamic forces is essential for advancing the
control, modeling, and design of flapping-wing aerial robots with dynamic
morphing capabilities. In this paper, we investigate two distinct methodologies
for force estimation on Aerobat, a bio-inspired flapping-wing platform designed
to emulate the inertial and aerodynamic behaviors observed in bat flight. Our
goal is to quantify aerodynamic force contributions during tethered flight, a
crucial step toward closed-loop flight control. The first method is a
physics-based observer derived from Hamiltonian mechanics that leverages the
concept of conjugate momentum to infer external aerodynamic forces acting on
the robot. This observer builds on the system's reduced-order dynamic model and
utilizes real-time sensor data to estimate forces without requiring training
data. The second method employs a neural network-based regression model,
specifically a multi-layer perceptron (MLP), to learn a mapping from joint
kinematics, flapping frequency, and environmental parameters to aerodynamic
force outputs. We evaluate both estimators using a 6-axis load cell in a
high-frequency data acquisition setup that enables fine-grained force
measurements during periodic wingbeats. The conjugate momentum observer and the
regression model demonstrate strong agreement across three force components
(Fx, Fy, Fz).

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Grounded Adaptive Curriculum Learning（GACL）的框架，用于机器人课程的自动化学习，解决了手动设计课程的不足，并在导航和四足机器人任务中取得了优于现有方法的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前机器人课程学习主要依赖手动设计，耗费大量工程资源且可能受主观影响。自动化课程学习在简单领域有效，但机器人任务的复杂性和目标领域分布的部分未知性带来了挑战。

Method: GACL框架包含三个关键创新：1）处理复杂机器人任务的任务表示；2）基于机器人当前能力的自适应课程生成机制；3）通过交替采样保持目标领域相关性的方法。

Result: 在受限环境中的轮式导航和3D狭窄空间中的四足机器人运动任务中，GACL分别比现有方法提高了6.8%和6.1%的成功率。

Conclusion: GACL为机器人课程学习提供了一个高效且自适应的解决方案，显著提升了任务性能。

Abstract: Curriculum learning has emerged as a promising approach for training complex
robotics tasks, yet current applications predominantly rely on manually
designed curricula, which demand significant engineering effort and can suffer
from subjective and suboptimal human design choices. While automated curriculum
learning has shown success in simple domains like grid worlds and games where
task distributions can be easily specified, robotics tasks present unique
challenges: they require handling complex task spaces while maintaining
relevance to target domain distributions that are only partially known through
limited samples. To this end, we propose Grounded Adaptive Curriculum Learning,
a framework specifically designed for robotics curriculum learning with three
key innovations: (1) a task representation that consistently handles complex
robot task design, (2) an active performance tracking mechanism that allows
adaptive curriculum generation appropriate for the robot's current
capabilities, and (3) a grounding approach that maintains target domain
relevance through alternating sampling between reference and synthetic tasks.
We validate GACL on wheeled navigation in constrained environments and
quadruped locomotion in challenging 3D confined spaces, achieving 6.8% and 6.1%
higher success rates, respectively, than state-of-the-art methods in each
domain.

Result: 实验验证解耦控制架构结合CRD在稳定性和步态表现上优于无CRD的方法。

Conclusion: 解耦控制架构结合CRD有效解决了扭矩控制带宽限制，提升了机器人性能。

Abstract: Husky Carbon, a robot developed by Northeastern University, serves as a
research platform to explore unification of posture manipulation and thrust
vectoring. Unlike conventional quadrupeds, its joint actuators and thrusters
enable enhanced control authority, facilitating thruster-assisted narrow-path
walking. While a unified Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework optimizing
both ground reaction forces and thruster forces could theoretically address
this control problem, its feasibility is limited by the low torque-control
bandwidth of the system's lightweight actuators. To overcome this challenge, we
propose a decoupled control architecture: a Raibert-type controller governs
legged locomotion using position-based control, while an MPC regulates the
thrusters augmented by learned Contact Residual Dynamics (CRD) to account for
leg-ground impacts. This separation bypasses the torque-control rate bottleneck
while retaining the thruster MPC to explicitly account for leg-ground impact
dynamics through learned residuals. We validate this approach through both
simulation and hardware experiments, showing that the decoupled control
architecture with CRD performs more stable behavior in terms of push recovery
and cat-like walking gait compared to the decoupled controller without CRD.

Abstract: Accurate and robust indoor localization is critical for smart building
applications, yet existing Wi-Fi-based systems are often vulnerable to
environmental conditions. This work presents a novel indoor localization
system, called LiGen, that leverages the spectral intensity patterns of ambient
light as fingerprints, offering a more stable and infrastructure-free
alternative to radio signals. To address the limited spectral data, we design a
data augmentation framework based on generative adversarial networks (GANs),
featuring two variants: PointGAN, which generates fingerprints conditioned on
coordinates, and FreeGAN, which uses a weak localization model to label
unconditioned samples. Our positioning model, leveraging a Multi-Layer
Perceptron (MLP) architecture to train on synthesized data, achieves
submeter-level accuracy, outperforming Wi-Fi-based baselines by over 50\%.
LiGen also demonstrates strong robustness in cluttered environments. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first system to combine spectral
fingerprints with GAN-based data augmentation for indoor localization.

Abstract: Path planning in unknown environments is a crucial yet inherently challenging

autonomous exploration and point-goal navigation. In both cases, the robot must
perceive the environment, update its belief, and accurately estimate potential
information gain on-the-fly to guide planning. In this work, we propose
CogniPlan, a novel path planning framework that leverages multiple plausible
layouts predicted by a COnditional GeNerative Inpainting model, mirroring how
humans rely on cognitive maps during navigation. These predictions, based on
the partially observed map and a set of layout conditioning vectors, enable our
planner to reason effectively under uncertainty. We demonstrate strong synergy
between generative image-based layout prediction and graph-attention-based path
planning, allowing CogniPlan to combine the scalability of graph
representations with the fidelity and predictiveness of occupancy maps,
yielding notable performance gains in both exploration and navigation. We
extensively evaluate CogniPlan on two datasets (hundreds of maps and realistic
floor plans), consistently outperforming state-of-the-art planners. We further
deploy it in a high-fidelity simulator and on hardware, showcasing its
high-quality path planning and real-world applicability.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种深度学习的鲁棒管模型预测控制器，使750毫克扑翼机器人实现了昆虫般的飞行敏捷性和鲁棒性，显著提升了速度和加速度表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 昆虫表现出高敏捷的飞行机动性，而昆虫级飞行机器人因低惯性、快速动态、扑翼空气动力学不确定性及环境干扰敏感性，难以实现类似性能。

Method: 设计了深度学习的鲁棒管模型预测控制器，并通过模仿学习方法训练双层全连接神经网络，以实现高反馈速率。

Result: 机器人展示了昆虫般的急转动作，速度和加速度分别提升了447%和255%，并在强风和力映射误差下保持性能。

Conclusion: 该成果标志着昆虫级飞行敏捷性的重要里程碑，为未来传感和计算自主性研究提供了启发。

Abstract: Aerial insects exhibit highly agile maneuvers such as sharp braking,
saccades, and body flips under disturbance. In contrast, insect-scale aerial
robots are limited to tracking non-aggressive trajectories with small body
acceleration. This performance gap is contributed by a combination of low robot
inertia, fast dynamics, uncertainty in flapping-wing aerodynamics, and high
susceptibility to environmental disturbance. Executing highly dynamic maneuvers
requires the generation of aggressive flight trajectories that push against the
hardware limit and a high-rate feedback controller that accounts for model and
environmental uncertainty. Here, through designing a deep-learned robust tube
model predictive controller, we showcase insect-like flight agility and
robustness in a 750-millgram flapping-wing robot. Our model predictive
controller can track aggressive flight trajectories under disturbance. To
achieve a high feedback rate in a compute-constrained real-time system, we
design imitation learning methods to train a two-layer, fully connected neural
network, which resembles insect flight control architecture consisting of
central nervous system and motor neurons. Our robot demonstrates insect-like
saccade movements with lateral speed and acceleration of 197 centimeters per
second and 11.7 meters per second square, representing 447$\%$ and 255$\%$
improvement over prior results. The robot can also perform saccade maneuvers
under 160 centimeters per second wind disturbance and large command-to-force
mapping errors. Furthermore, it performs 10 consecutive body flips in 11
seconds - the most challenging maneuver among sub-gram flyers. These results
represent a milestone in achieving insect-scale flight agility and inspire
future investigations on sensing and compute autonomy.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于手绘草图导航的任务SkeNa，并发布了大规模数据集SoR。通过自动化草图生成和导航框架SkeNavigator，显著提升了导航性能。


<details>

Motivation: 受人类导航策略启发，研究如何利用手绘草图在未知环境中导航。

Result: SkeNavigator在高度抽象的验证集上相对提升了105%的SPL。

Conclusion: SkeNa任务和SoR数据集为未来研究提供了基础，SkeNavigator框架表现出色。

Abstract: A typical human strategy for giving navigation guidance is to sketch route
maps based on the environmental layout. Inspired by this, we introduce Sketch
map-based visual Navigation (SkeNa), an embodied navigation task in which an
agent must reach a goal in an unseen environment using only a hand-drawn sketch
map as guidance. To support research for SkeNa, we present a large-scale
dataset named SoR, comprising 54k trajectory and sketch map pairs across 71
indoor scenes. In SoR, we introduce two navigation validation sets with varying
levels of abstraction in hand-drawn sketches, categorized based on their
preservation of spatial scales in the environment, to facilitate future
research. To construct SoR, we develop an automated sketch-generation pipeline
that efficiently converts floor plans into hand-drawn representations. To solve
SkeNa, we propose SkeNavigator, a navigation framework that aligns visual
observations with hand-drawn maps to estimate navigation targets. It employs a
Ray-based Map Descriptor (RMD) to enhance sketch map valid feature
representation using equidistant sampling points and boundary distances. To
improve alignment with visual observations, a Dual-Map Aligned Goal Predictor
(DAGP) leverages the correspondence between sketch map features and on-site
constructed exploration map features to predict goal position and guide
navigation. SkeNavigator outperforms prior floor plan navigation methods by a
large margin, improving SPL on the high-abstract validation set by 105%
relatively. Our code and dataset will be released.

Result: 在仿真和现实环境中验证了人形机器人在复杂人类环境中的导航和抓取能力。

Conclusion: 模块化方法有效解耦视觉感知与物理动作，提升了学习效率和场景适应性。

Abstract: We propose Hand-Eye Autonomous Delivery (HEAD), a framework that learns
navigation, locomotion, and reaching skills for humanoids, directly from human
motion and vision perception data. We take a modular approach where the
high-level planner commands the target position and orientation of the hands
and eyes of the humanoid, delivered by the low-level policy that controls the
whole-body movements. Specifically, the low-level whole-body controller learns
to track the three points (eyes, left hand, and right hand) from existing
large-scale human motion capture data while high-level policy learns from human
data collected by Aria glasses. Our modular approach decouples the ego-centric
vision perception from physical actions, promoting efficient learning and
scalability to novel scenes. We evaluate our method both in simulation and in
the real-world, demonstrating humanoid's capabilities to navigate and reach in
complex environments designed for humans.

Result: 尽管形态差异，Cassie的步态与人类高度相似；控制器成功实现100米短跑世界纪录。

Conclusion: 双足机器人跑步步态优化可行，且与人类跑步机制相似，硬件实现验证了其潜力。

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the space of running gaits for the bipedal robot
Cassie. Our first contribution is to present an approach for optimizing gait
efficiency across a spectrum of speeds with the aim of enabling extremely
high-speed running on hardware. This raises the question of how the resulting
gaits compare to human running mechanics, which are known to be highly
efficient in comparison to quadrupeds. Our second contribution is to conduct
this comparison based on established human biomechanical studies. We find that
despite morphological differences between Cassie and humans, key properties of
the gaits are highly similar across a wide range of speeds. Finally, our third
contribution is to integrate the optimized running gaits into a full controller
that satisfies the rules of the real-world task of the 100m dash, including
starting and stopping from a standing position. We demonstrate this controller
on hardware to establish the Guinness World Record for Fastest 100m by a
Bipedal Robot.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型为通用机器人提供了零样本任务执行能力，但现有方法在2D图像中获取的语义信息难以精确定位3D动作点。

Method: 提出3D相关性场，绕过高维特征，利用多视角聚合补偿几何模糊性和语义不确定性，生成精细的3D空间上下文。

Result: 全栈流程在20秒内生成空间接地响应，支持实际操控任务。

Conclusion: Point2Act通过高效3D定位和快速响应，为机器人任务提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: We propose Point2Act, which directly retrieves the 3D action point relevant
for a contextually described task, leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs). Foundation models opened the possibility for generalist robots that
can perform a zero-shot task following natural language descriptions within an
unseen environment. While the semantics obtained from large-scale image and
language datasets provide contextual understanding in 2D images, the rich yet
nuanced features deduce blurry 2D regions and struggle to find precise 3D
locations for actions. Our proposed 3D relevancy fields bypass the
high-dimensional features and instead efficiently imbue lightweight 2D
point-level guidance tailored to the task-specific action. The multi-view
aggregation effectively compensates for misalignments due to geometric
ambiguities, such as occlusion, or semantic uncertainties inherent in the
language descriptions. The output region is highly localized, reasoning
fine-grained 3D spatial context that can directly transfer to an explicit
position for physical action at the on-the-fly reconstruction of the scene. Our
full-stack pipeline, which includes capturing, MLLM querying, 3D
reconstruction, and grasp pose extraction, generates spatially grounded
responses in under 20 seconds, facilitating practical manipulation tasks.

Result: 在四足机器人运动和视觉导航仿真及四旋翼实验中验证了安全性和任务性能的提升。

Conclusion: MPC-SafeGIL将安全考虑直接融入数据收集，有效提升模仿学习的安全性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Imitation Learning has provided a promising approach to learning complex
robot behaviors from expert demonstrations. However, learned policies can make
errors that lead to safety violations, which limits their deployment in
safety-critical applications. We propose MPC-SafeGIL, a design-time approach
that enhances the safety of imitation learning by injecting adversarial
disturbances during expert demonstrations. This exposes the expert to a broader
range of safety-critical scenarios and allows the imitation policy to learn
robust recovery behaviors. Our method uses sampling-based Model Predictive
Control (MPC) to approximate worst-case disturbances, making it scalable to
high-dimensional and black-box dynamical systems. In contrast to prior work
that relies on analytical models or interactive experts, MPC-SafeGIL integrates
safety considerations directly into data collection. We validate our approach
through extensive simulations including quadruped locomotion and visuomotor
navigation and real-world experiments on a quadrotor, demonstrating
improvements in both safety and task performance. See our website here:

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于视觉语言模型（VLM）的零样本语言作为成本映射框架，使机器人能够预判动态风险并主动规划路径。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统导航系统依赖静态地图，难以应对动态风险（如突然出现的行人），导致反应式而非预判式处理。

Method: 利用VLM解析视觉场景，评估动态风险，并预分配风险感知导航成本，结合几何障碍地图实现主动规划。

Result: 在模拟和多样动态环境中的实验表明，该方法显著提高了导航成功率并减少了危险遭遇。

Conclusion: 语言作为成本映射框架为机器人提供了预判动态风险的能力，优于传统反应式规划器。

Abstract: Robots operating in human-centric or hazardous environments must proactively
anticipate and mitigate dangers beyond basic obstacle detection. Traditional
navigation systems often depend on static maps, which struggle to account for
dynamic risks, such as a person emerging from a suddenly opening door. As a
result, these systems tend to be reactive rather than anticipatory when
handling dynamic hazards. Recent advancements in pre-trained large language
models and vision-language models (VLMs) create new opportunities for proactive
hazard avoidance. In this work, we propose a zero-shot language-as-cost mapping
framework that leverages VLMs to interpret visual scenes, assess potential
dynamic risks, and assign risk-aware navigation costs preemptively, enabling
robots to anticipate hazards before they materialize. By integrating this
language-based cost map with a geometric obstacle map, the robot not only
identifies existing obstacles but also anticipates and proactively plans around
potential hazards arising from environmental dynamics. Experiments in simulated
and diverse dynamic environments demonstrate that the proposed method
significantly improves navigation success rates and reduces hazard encounters,
compared to reactive baseline planners. Code and supplementary materials are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有体现规划基准测试多为短视任务和粗粒度动作，无法满足复杂物理世界中长期任务的需求。

Result: 提供了全面的工具集和统一API，支持宏观操作和细粒度动作，分析了现有大型语言模型和视觉语言模型的不足。

Conclusion: CookBench为复杂长期任务提供了新基准，促进未来研究，并将开源以支持社区。

Abstract: Embodied Planning is dedicated to the goal of creating agents capable of
executing long-horizon tasks in complex physical worlds. However, existing
embodied planning benchmarks frequently feature short-horizon tasks and
coarse-grained action primitives. To address this challenge, we introduce
CookBench, a benchmark for long-horizon planning in complex cooking scenarios.
By leveraging a high-fidelity simulation environment built upon the powerful
Unity game engine, we define frontier AI challenges in a complex, realistic
environment. The core task in CookBench is designed as a two-stage process.
First, in Intention Recognition, an agent needs to accurately parse a user's
complex intent. Second, in Embodied Interaction, the agent should execute the
identified cooking goal through a long-horizon, fine-grained sequence of
physical actions. Unlike existing embodied planning benchmarks, we refine the
action granularity to a spatial level that considers crucial operational
information while abstracting away low-level robotic control. Besides, We
provide a comprehensive toolset that encapsulates the simulator. Its unified
API supports both macro-level operations, such as placing orders and purchasing
ingredients, and a rich set of fine-grained embodied actions for physical
interaction, enabling researchers to focus on high-level planning and
decision-making. Furthermore, we present an in-depth analysis of
state-of-the-art, closed-source Large Language Model and Vision-Language Model,
revealing their major shortcomings and challenges posed by complex,
long-horizon tasks. The full benchmark will be open-sourced to facilitate
future research.

Result: 系统在HexGuide机器人上实现，能够适应用户力指令并同时保障用户和机器人的安全。

Conclusion: FC-MPC和CBFs在复杂环境中有效实现了力顺应导航和障碍物避障。

Abstract: Guiding the visually impaired in complex environments requires real-time
two-way interaction and safety assurance. We propose a Force-Compliance Model
Predictive Control (FC-MPC) and Robot-User Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) for
force-compliant navigation and obstacle avoidance in Hexapod guide robots.
FC-MPC enables two-way interaction by estimating user-applied forces and
moments using the robot's dynamic model and the recursive least squares (RLS)
method, and then adjusting the robot's movements accordingly, while Robot-User
CBFs ensure the safety of both the user and the robot by handling static and
dynamic obstacles, and employ weighted slack variables to overcome feasibility
issues in complex dynamic environments. We also adopt an Eight-Way Connected
DBSCAN method for obstacle clustering, reducing computational complexity from
O(n2) to approximately O(n), enabling real-time local perception on
resource-limited on-board robot computers. Obstacles are modeled using Minimum
Bounding Ellipses (MBEs), and their trajectories are predicted through Kalman
filtering. Implemented on the HexGuide robot, the system seamlessly integrates
force compliance, autonomous navigation, and obstacle avoidance. Experimental
results demonstrate the system's ability to adapt to user force commands while
guaranteeing user and robot safety simultaneously during navigation in complex
environments.

Motivation: 现有灵巧抓取数据集过于关注稳定性，忽视了功能性抓取（如开瓶盖或握杯柄），且依赖昂贵、笨重的高自由度Shadow Hands。

Method: 基于仿生学，将人类自然动作映射到不同手结构，利用几何力闭合确保功能性、稳定且类人的抓取。

Conclusion: UniFucGrasp克服了灵巧抓取中标注成本和泛化能力的挑战，为功能性抓取提供了高效、低成本的解决方案。

Abstract: Dexterous grasp datasets are vital for embodied intelligence, but mostly
emphasize grasp stability, ignoring functional grasps needed for tasks like
opening bottle caps or holding cup handles. Most rely on bulky, costly, and
hard-to-control high-DOF Shadow Hands. Inspired by the human hand's
underactuated mechanism, we establish UniFucGrasp, a universal functional grasp
annotation strategy and dataset for multiple dexterous hand types. Based on
biomimicry, it maps natural human motions to diverse hand structures and uses
geometry-based force closure to ensure functional, stable, human-like grasps.
This method supports low-cost, efficient collection of diverse, high-quality
functional grasps. Finally, we establish the first multi-hand functional grasp
dataset and provide a synthesis model to validate its effectiveness.
Experiments on the UFG dataset, IsaacSim, and complex robotic tasks show that
our method improves functional manipulation accuracy and grasp stability,
enables efficient generalization across diverse robotic hands, and overcomes
annotation cost and generalization challenges in dexterous grasping. The

Motivation: 水下机器人需要可靠的场景重建能力，但单目视觉方法在浑浊水域不可靠，声纳分辨率低且有高度模糊问题。

Result: 在不同浑浊度水域和码头环境中的实验验证了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法在浑浊水域中表现优越，代码已开源以促进复现和社区参与。

Abstract: Scene reconstruction is an essential capability for underwater robots
navigating in close proximity to structures. Monocular vision-based
reconstruction methods are unreliable in turbid waters and lack depth scale
information. Sonars are robust to turbid water and non-uniform lighting
conditions, however, they have low resolution and elevation ambiguity. This
work proposes a real-time opti-acoustic scene reconstruction method that is
specially optimized to work in turbid water. Our strategy avoids having to
identify point features in visual data and instead identifies regions of
interest in the data. We then match relevant regions in the image to
corresponding sonar data. A reconstruction is obtained by leveraging range data
from the sonar and elevation data from the camera image. Experimental
comparisons against other vision-based and sonar-based approaches at varying
turbidity levels, and field tests conducted in marina environments, validate
the effectiveness of the proposed approach. We have made our code open-source
to facilitate reproducibility and encourage community engagement.

Method: 利用HJ值函数可分解为符号距离函数（SDF）和非负残差函数的性质，用神经网络建模残差，并通过超网络参数化提升性能。

Result: 在仿真和硬件实验中，比现有方法成功率提高30%，计算成本相近且路径质量高。

Conclusion: 该方法在实时性和安全性上优于现有技术，适用于复杂环境下的路径规划。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a hybrid MPC local planner that uses a
learning-based approximation of a time-varying safe set, derived from local
observations and applied as the MPC terminal constraint. This set can be
represented as a zero-superlevel set of the value function computed via
Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis, which is infeasible in real-time.
We exploit the property that the HJ value function can be expressed as a
difference of the corresponding signed distance function (SDF) and a
non-negative residual function. The residual component is modeled as a neural
network with non-negative output and subtracted from the computed SDF,
resulting in a real-time value function estimate that is at least as safe as
the SDF by design. Additionally, we parametrize the neural residual by a
hypernetwork to improve real-time performance and generalization properties.
The proposed method is compared with three state-of-the-art methods in
simulations and hardware experiments, achieving up to 30\% higher success rates
compared to the best baseline while requiring a similar computational effort
and producing high-quality (low travel-time) solutions.

Conclusion: 该框架为跨学科团队开发社交表现型机器人行为提供了模型，促进了戏剧作为人机交互训练场的作用，以及人机共创方法的发展。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose theatre-in-the-loop, a framework for developing
expressive robot behaviours tailored to artistic performance through a
director-guided puppeteering workflow. Leveraging theatrical methods, we use
narrative objectives to direct a puppeteer in generating improvised robotic
gestures that convey specific emotions. These improvisations are captured and
curated to build a dataset of reusable movement templates for standalone
playback in future autonomous performances. Initial trials demonstrate the
feasibility of this approach, illustrating how the workflow enables precise
sculpting of robotic gestures into coherent emotional arcs while revealing
challenges posed by the robot's mechanical constraints. We argue that this
practice-led framework provides a model for interdisciplinary teams creating
socially expressive robot behaviours, contributing to (1) theatre as an
interactive training ground for human-robot interaction and (2) co-creation
methodologies between humans and machines.

Motivation: 传统机器人操纵任务主要针对小型物体，而工厂或家庭环境中常需移动大型物体，现有研究缺乏可扩展至任意机器人规模和任务类型的框架。

Result: 实验在不同机器人数量、物体和任务中实现52%的成功率。

Conclusion: CollaBot框架在多机器人协作操纵大型物体任务中表现出有效性。

Abstract: A central research topic in robotics is how to use this system to interact
with the physical world. Traditional manipulation tasks primarily focus on
small objects. However, in factory or home environments, there is often a need
for the movement of large objects, such as moving tables. These tasks typically
require multi-robot systems to work collaboratively. Previous research lacks a
framework that can scale to arbitrary sizes of robots and generalize to various
kinds of tasks. In this work, we propose CollaBot, a generalist framework for
simultaneous collaborative manipulation. First, we use SEEM for scene
segmentation and point cloud extraction of the target object. Then, we propose
a collaborative grasping framework, which decomposes the task into local grasp
pose generation and global collaboration. Finally, we design a 2-stage planning
module that can generate collision-free trajectories to achieve this task.
Experiments show a success rate of 52% across different numbers of robots,
objects, and tasks, indicating the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

vision sensor based multi-pedestrian detection and tracking, pose estimation,
and monocular depth perception. Leveraging the real-world MOT17 dataset
sequences, this study demonstrates how integrating human-pose estimation and
depth cues enhances pedestrian trajectory prediction and identity maintenance,
even under occlusions and dense crowds. Results show measurable improvements,
including up to a 10% increase in identity preservation (IDF1), a 7%
improvement in multiobject tracking accuracy (MOTA), and consistently high
detection precision exceeding 85%, even in challenging scenarios. Notably, the
system identifies vulnerable pedestrian groups supporting more socially aware
and inclusive robot behaviour.

Abstract: Vibration suppression is an important capability for collaborative robots
deployed in challenging environments such as construction sites. We study the
active suppression of vibration caused by external sources such as power tools.
We adopt the band-limited multiple Fourier linear combiner (BMFLC) algorithm to
learn the vibration online and counter it by feedforward force control. We
propose the damped BMFLC method, extending BMFLC with a novel adaptive
step-size approach that improves the convergence time and noise resistance. Our
logistic function-based damping mechanism reduces the effect of noise and
enables larger learning rates. We evaluate our method on extensive simulation
experiments with realistic time-varying multi-frequency vibration and
real-world physical interaction experiments. The simulation experiments show
that our method improves the suppression rate in comparison to the original
BMFLC and its recursive least squares and Kalman filter-based extensions.
Furthermore, our method is far more efficient than the latter two. We further
validate the effectiveness of our method in real-world polishing experiments. A

Conclusion: 该方法为机器人提供了一种动态适应层，无需额外训练即可实时调整，同时保留核心知识。

Abstract: Imagine a robot controller with the ability to adapt like human synapses,
dynamically rewiring itself to overcome unforeseen challenges in real time.
This paper proposes a novel zero-shot adaptation mechanism for evolutionary
robotics, merging a standard Genetic Algorithm (GA) controller with online
Hebbian plasticity. Inspired by biological systems, the method separates
learning and memory, with the genotype acting as memory and Hebbian updates
handling learning. In our approach, the fitness function is leveraged as a live
scaling factor for Hebbian learning, enabling the robot's neural controller to
adjust synaptic weights on-the-fly without additional training. This adds a
dynamic adaptive layer that activates only during runtime to handle unexpected
environmental changes. After the task, the robot 'forgets' the temporary
adjustments and reverts to the original weights, preserving core knowledge. We
validate this hybrid GA-Hebbian controller on an e-puck robot in a T-maze
navigation task with changing light conditions and obstacles.

Result: 在CALVIN基准测试中，DiWA仅通过离线适应提升八项任务性能，样本效率显著优于无模型基线。

Conclusion: DiWA首次实现基于离线世界模型的扩散策略微调，为实际机器人学习提供高效安全方案。

Abstract: Fine-tuning diffusion policies with reinforcement learning (RL) presents
significant challenges. The long denoising sequence for each action prediction
impedes effective reward propagation. Moreover, standard RL methods require
millions of real-world interactions, posing a major bottleneck for practical
fine-tuning. Although prior work frames the denoising process in diffusion
policies as a Markov Decision Process to enable RL-based updates, its strong
dependence on environment interaction remains highly inefficient. To bridge
this gap, we introduce DiWA, a novel framework that leverages a world model for
fine-tuning diffusion-based robotic skills entirely offline with reinforcement
learning. Unlike model-free approaches that require millions of environment
interactions to fine-tune a repertoire of robot skills, DiWA achieves effective
adaptation using a world model trained once on a few hundred thousand offline
play interactions. This results in dramatically improved sample efficiency,
making the approach significantly more practical and safer for real-world robot
learning. On the challenging CALVIN benchmark, DiWA improves performance across
eight tasks using only offline adaptation, while requiring orders of magnitude
fewer physical interactions than model-free baselines. To our knowledge, this
is the first demonstration of fine-tuning diffusion policies for real-world
robotic skills using an offline world model. We make the code publicly
available at https://diwa.cs.uni-freiburg.de.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Inland-LOAM是一种用于内河水道的LiDAR SLAM框架，通过改进的特征提取和水面平面约束减少垂直漂移，并生成结构化2D语义地图，提升自主导航的准确性和实时性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有内河水道图（IENC）缺乏实时细节，传统LiDAR SLAM在水道环境中表现不佳，导致垂直漂移和非语义地图，阻碍自主导航。

Method: 提出Inland-LOAM框架，结合改进的特征提取、水面平面约束和体素几何分析，将3D点云转换为结构化2D语义地图，并自动提取岸线。

Result: 在真实数据集上评估，Inland-LOAM的定位精度优于现有方法，生成的语义地图和岸线与实际情况一致。

Conclusion: Inland-LOAM为内河水道自主导航提供了可靠的地理空间信息，代码和数据集将公开。

Abstract: Accurate geospatial information is crucial for safe, autonomous Inland
Waterway Transport (IWT), as existing charts (IENC) lack real-time detail and
conventional LiDAR SLAM fails in waterway environments. These challenges lead
to vertical drift and non-semantic maps, hindering autonomous navigation.
  This paper introduces Inland-LOAM, a LiDAR SLAM framework for waterways. It
uses an improved feature extraction and a water surface planar constraint to
mitigate vertical drift. A novel pipeline transforms 3D point clouds into
structured 2D semantic maps using voxel-based geometric analysis, enabling
real-time computation of navigational parameters like bridge clearances. An
automated module extracts shorelines and exports them into a lightweight,
IENC-compatible format.
  Evaluations on a real-world dataset show Inland-LOAM achieves superior
localization accuracy over state-of-the-art methods. The generated semantic
maps and shorelines align with real-world conditions, providing reliable data
for enhanced situational awareness. The code and dataset will be publicly
available

*Patrick Paetzold,Rebecca Kehlbeck,Yumeng Xue,Bin Chen,Yunhai Wang,Oliver Deussen*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于数据相似性的Voronoi树图算法，通过预处理和优化步骤生成保留邻域关系的树图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Voronoi树图仅展示层次结构，但数据常包含相似性等属性，需一种方法同时保留层次和邻域关系。

Method: 扩展树图布局流程，结合Kuhn-Munkres匹配和贪婪交换优化，迭代调整单元大小以保留邻域。

Result: 通过实际案例验证了方法的实用性，定量评估显示邻域关系得到保留。

Conclusion: 该方法有效结合层次结构和数据相似性，适用于信息图表和语言学等领域。

Abstract: Voronoi treemaps are used to depict nodes and their hierarchical
relationships simultaneously. However, in addition to the hierarchical
structure, data attributes, such as co-occurring features or similarities,
frequently exist. Examples include geographical attributes like shared borders
between countries or contextualized semantic information such as embedding
vectors derived from large language models. In this work, we introduce a
Voronoi treemap algorithm that leverages data similarity to generate
neighborhood-preserving treemaps. First, we extend the treemap layout pipeline
to consider similarity during data preprocessing. We then use a Kuhn-Munkres
matching of similarities to centroidal Voronoi tessellation (CVT) cells to
create initial Voronoi diagrams with equal cell sizes for each level. Greedy
swapping is used to improve the neighborhoods of cells to match the data's
similarity further. During optimization, cell areas are iteratively adjusted to
their respective sizes while preserving the existing neighborhoods. We
demonstrate the practicality of our approach through multiple real-world
examples drawn from infographics and linguistics. To quantitatively assess the
resulting treemaps, we employ treemap metrics and measure neighborhood
preservation.

TL;DR: READ是一个基于扩散-Transformer的实时说话头生成框架，通过压缩视频和语音潜在空间及异步噪声调度器，显著提升了生成速度和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在说话头生成中取得了进展，但推理速度慢限制了其实际应用。

Method: 使用时间VAE压缩视频潜在空间，预训练SpeechAE生成语音潜在码，通过A2V-DiT建模，并设计异步噪声调度器（ANS）优化训练和推理。

Result: READ在生成质量和速度上优于现有方法，并在长时间生成中保持稳定性。

Conclusion: READ实现了速度与质量的平衡，为实时说话头生成提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The introduction of diffusion models has brought significant advances to the
field of audio-driven talking head generation. However, the extremely slow
inference speed severely limits the practical implementation of diffusion-based
talking head generation models. In this study, we propose READ, the first
real-time diffusion-transformer-based talking head generation framework. Our
approach first learns a spatiotemporal highly compressed video latent space via
a temporal VAE, significantly reducing the token count to accelerate
generation. To achieve better audio-visual alignment within this compressed
latent space, a pre-trained Speech Autoencoder (SpeechAE) is proposed to
generate temporally compressed speech latent codes corresponding to the video
latent space. These latent representations are then modeled by a carefully
designed Audio-to-Video Diffusion Transformer (A2V-DiT) backbone for efficient
talking head synthesis. Furthermore, to ensure temporal consistency and
accelerated inference in extended generation, we propose a novel asynchronous
noise scheduler (ANS) for both the training and inference process of our
framework. The ANS leverages asynchronous add-noise and asynchronous
motion-guided generation in the latent space, ensuring consistency in generated
video clips. Experimental results demonstrate that READ outperforms
state-of-the-art methods by generating competitive talking head videos with
significantly reduced runtime, achieving an optimal balance between quality and
speed while maintaining robust metric stability in long-time generation.
