However, in addition to the hierarchical\nstructure, data attributes, such as co-occurring features or similarities,\nfrequently exist. Examples include geographical attributes like shared borders\nbetween countries or contextualized semantic information such as embedding\nvectors derived from large language models. In this work, we introduce a\nVoronoi treemap algorithm that leverages data similarity to generate\nneighborhood-preserving treemaps. First, we extend the treemap layout pipeline\nto consider similarity during data preprocessing. We then use a Kuhn-Munkres\nmatching of similarities to centroidal Voronoi tessellation (CVT) cells to\ncreate initial Voronoi diagrams with equal cell sizes for each level. Greedy\nswapping is used to improve the neighborhoods of cells to match the data's\nsimilarity further. During optimization, cell areas are iteratively adjusted to\ntheir respective sizes while preserving the existing neighborhoods.

Building upon the foundation of CycleGAN, our approach\nintegrates Local Neighborhood Encoding (LNE) and frequency-aware supervision to\ncapture fine-grained local pixel semantics while preserving structural\ncoherence from the source domain. We employ distribution-based loss metrics,\nincluding KL/JS divergence and log-based similarity measures, to explicitly\nquantify the alignment between real and generated image distributions in both\nspatial and frequency domains. To validate the efficacy of Fd-CycleGAN, we\nconduct experiments on diverse datasets -- Horse2Zebra, Monet2Photo, and a\nsynthetically augmented Strike-off dataset. Compared to baseline CycleGAN and\nother state-of-the-art methods, our approach demonstrates superior perceptual\nquality, faster convergence, and improved mode diversity, particularly in\nlow-data regimes. By effectively capturing local and global distribution\ncharacteristics, Fd-CycleGAN achieves more visually coherent and semantically\nconsistent translations. Our results suggest that frequency-guided latent\nlearning significantly improves generalization in image translation tasks, with\npromising applications in document restoration, artistic style transfer, and\nmedical image synthesis.

However, most existing end-to-end methods rely heavily on scarce\npaired garment-centric datasets and fail to effectively leverage priors of\nadvanced visual models and test-time inputs, making it challenging to\naccurately preserve fine-grained garment details and maintain temporal\nconsistency in unconstrained scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose\nDreamVVT, a carefully designed two-stage framework built upon Diffusion\nTransformers (DiTs), which is inherently capable of leveraging diverse unpaired\nhuman-centric data to enhance adaptability in real-world scenarios. To further\nleverage prior knowledge from pretrained models and test-time inputs, in the\nfirst stage, we sample representative frames from the input video and utilize a\nmulti-frame try-on model integrated with a vision-language model (VLM), to\nsynthesize high-fidelity and semantically consistent keyframe try-on images.\nThese images serve as complementary appearance guidance for subsequent video\ngeneration. \\textbf{In the second stage}, skeleton maps together with\nfine-grained motion and appearance descriptions are extracted from the input\ncontent, and these along with the keyframe try-on images are then fed into a\npretrained video generation model enhanced with LoRA adapters. This ensures\nlong-term temporal coherence for unseen regions and enables highly plausible\ndynamic motions. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate\nthat DreamVVT surpasses existing methods in preserving detailed garment content\nand temporal stability in real-world scenarios.

NeRF achieves high-fidelity\nnovel view synthesis by learning volumetric representations through neural\nnetworks, but its implicit encoding makes editing and physical interaction\nchallenging. In contrast, GS represents scenes as explicit collections of\nGaussian primitives, enabling real-time rendering, faster training, and more\nintuitive manipulation. This explicit structure has made GS particularly\nwell-suited for interactive editing and integration with physics-based\nsimulation. In this paper, we introduce GENIE (Gaussian Encoding for Neural\nRadiance Fields Interactive Editing), a hybrid model that combines the\nphotorealistic rendering quality of NeRF with the editable and structured\nrepresentation of GS. Instead of using spherical harmonics for appearance\nmodeling, we assign each Gaussian a trainable feature embedding. These\nembeddings are used to condition a NeRF network based on the k nearest\nGaussians to each query point. To make this conditioning efficient, we\nintroduce Ray-Traced Gaussian Proximity Search (RT-GPS), a fast nearest\nGaussian search based on a modified ray-tracing pipeline. We also integrate a\nmulti-resolution hash grid to initialize and update Gaussian features.\nTogether, these components enable real-time, locality-aware editing: as\nGaussian primitives are repositioned or modified, their interpolated influence\nis immediately reflected in the rendered output. By combining the strengths of\nimplicit and explicit representations, GENIE supports intuitive scene\nmanipulation, dynamic interaction, and compatibility with physical simulation,\nbridging the gap between geometry-based editing and neural rendering.

A Refined Multi-hop\nLine-of-Sight (RM-LoS) graph is constructed to encode the occlusion\nrelationships among vehicles, upon which MIDAR employs a GRU-enhanced APPNP\narchitecture to propagate features from the ego AV and occluding vehicles to\nthe prediction target. MIDAR achieves an AUC of 0.909 in approximating the\ndetection results generated by CenterPoint, a mainstream 3D LiDAR detection\nmodel, on the nuScenes AD dataset. Two CP-based traffic applications further\nvalidate the necessity of such realistic detection modeling, particularly for\ntasks requiring accurate individual vehicle observations (e.g., position,\nspeed, lane index). As demonstrated in the applications, MIDAR can be\nseamlessly integrated into traffic simulators and trajectory datasets and will\nbe open-sourced upon publication.", "AI": {"tldr": "MIDAR\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6a21\u62dfLiDAR\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u5fae\u89c2\u4ea4\u901a\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u63a5\u8fd1\u771f\u5b9e\u7684LiDAR\u68c0\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5f25\u8865\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u62df\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u62df\u5de5\u5177\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff1a\u6e38\u620f\u5f15\u64ce\u6a21\u62df\u5668\uff08\u5982CARLA\uff09\u5728\u591a\u8f66\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u5dee\uff0c\u800c\u5fae\u89c2\u4ea4\u901a\u6a21\u62df\u5668\uff08\u5982SUMO\uff09\u7f3a\u4e4f\u611f\u77e5\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "MIDAR\u901a\u8fc7\u8f66\u8f86\u7ea7\u7279\u5f81\u9884\u6d4b\u771f\u5b9eLiDAR\u68c0\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u6784\u5efaRM-LoS\u56fe\u7f16\u7801\u906e\u6321\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528GRU\u589e\u5f3a\u7684APPNP\u67b6\u6784\u8fdb\u884c\u7279\u5f81\u4f20\u64ad\u3002", "result": "\u5728nuScenes\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cMIDAR\u7684AUC\u8fbe\u52300.909\uff0c\u63a5\u8fd1\u4e3b\u6d413D LiDAR\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578bCenterPoint\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "MIDAR\u80fd\u65e0\u7f1d\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u4ea4\u901a\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u548c\u8f68\u8ff9\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e3a\u9700\u8981\u7cbe\u786e\u8f66\u8f86\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5f00\u6e90\u53d1\u5e03\u3002"}}

Accepted to the ICCV 2025 Workshop on\n  Vision-based Industrial InspectiON (VISION)", "summary": "Recent advancements in diffusion models have demonstrated significant success\nin unsupervised anomaly segmentation. For anomaly segmentation, these models\nare first trained on normal data; then, an anomalous image is noised to an\nintermediate step, and the normal image is reconstructed through backward\ndiffusion. Unlike traditional statistical methods, diffusion models do not rely\non specific assumptions about the data or target anomalies, making them\nversatile for use across different domains. However, diffusion models typically\nassume access to normal data for training, limiting their applicability in\nrealistic settings. In this paper, we propose novel robust denoising diffusion\nmodels for scenarios where only contaminated (i.e., a mix of normal and\nanomalous) unlabeled data is available. By casting maximum likelihood\nestimation of the data as a nonlinear regression problem, we reinterpret the\ndenoising diffusion probabilistic model through a regression lens. Using robust\nregression, we derive a robust version of denoising diffusion probabilistic\nmodels. Our novel framework offers flexibility in constructing various robust\ndiffusion models. Our experiments show that our approach outperforms current\nstate of the art diffusion models, for unsupervised anomaly segmentation when\nonly contaminated data is available. Our method outperforms existing\ndiffusion-based approaches, achieving up to 8.08\\% higher AUROC and 10.37\\%\nhigher AUPRC on MVTec datasets.

Therefore, this paper presents a unified approach that selects\ntarget distant objects using human verbal and non-verbal commands and performs\nthe handover operation by contextualizing human implicit and explicit\npreferences to generate robot grasps and compliant handover motion sequences.\nWe evaluate our integrated framework and its components through real-world\nexperiments and user studies with arbitrary daily-life objects. The results of\nthese evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed pipeline in\nhandling object handover tasks by understanding human preferences.

The estimated\nimage and blur filter are defined as the maximizer of the posterior\ndistribution.

In this paper, we revisit this result using diffusion-based\npriors, a class of models that capture realistic image distributions. Through\nan empirical examination of the prior's likelihood landscape, we uncover two\nkey properties: first, blurry images tend to have higher likelihoods; second,\nthe landscape contains numerous local minimizers that correspond to natural\nimages. Building on these insights, we provide a theoretical analysis of the\nblind deblurring posterior. This reveals that the MAP estimator tends to\nproduce sharp filters (close to the Dirac delta function) and blurry solutions.\nHowever local minimizers of the posterior, which can be obtained with gradient\ndescent, correspond to realistic, natural images, effectively solving the blind\ndeconvolution problem.

Inspired by this, we introduce Sketch\nmap-based visual Navigation (SkeNa), an embodied navigation task in which an\nagent must reach a goal in an unseen environment using only a hand-drawn sketch\nmap as guidance. To support research for SkeNa, we present a large-scale\ndataset named SoR, comprising 54k trajectory and sketch map pairs across 71\nindoor scenes. In SoR, we introduce two navigation validation sets with varying\nlevels of abstraction in hand-drawn sketches, categorized based on their\npreservation of spatial scales in the environment, to facilitate future\nresearch. To construct SoR, we develop an automated sketch-generation pipeline\nthat efficiently converts floor plans into hand-drawn representations. To solve\nSkeNa, we propose SkeNavigator, a navigation framework that aligns visual\nobservations with hand-drawn maps to estimate navigation targets. It employs a\nRay-based Map Descriptor (RMD) to enhance sketch map valid feature\nrepresentation using equidistant sampling points and boundary distances. To\nimprove alignment with visual observations, a Dual-Map Aligned Goal Predictor\n(DAGP) leverages the correspondence between sketch map features and on-site\nconstructed exploration map features to predict goal position and guide\nnavigation.

First, AFOG utilizes a learnable attention mechanism that\nfocuses perturbations on vulnerable image regions in multi-box detection tasks,\nincreasing performance over non-attention baselines by up to 30.6%. Second,\nAFOG's attack loss is formulated by integrating two types of feature loss\nthrough learnable attention updates with iterative injection of adversarial\nperturbations. Finally, AFOG is an efficient and stealthy adversarial\nperturbation method. It probes the weak spots of detection transformers by\nadding strategically generated and visually imperceptible perturbations which\ncan cause well-trained object detection models to fail.

Traditional\nnavigation systems often depend on static maps, which struggle to account for\ndynamic risks, such as a person emerging from a suddenly opening door.

By integrating this\nlanguage-based cost map with a geometric obstacle map, the robot not only\nidentifies existing obstacles but also anticipates and proactively plans around\npotential hazards arising from environmental dynamics.

Obstacles are modeled using Minimum\nBounding Ellipses (MBEs), and their trajectories are predicted through Kalman\nfiltering. Implemented on the HexGuide robot, the system seamlessly integrates\nforce compliance, autonomous navigation, and obstacle avoidance. Experimental\nresults demonstrate the system's ability to adapt to user force commands while\nguaranteeing user and robot safety simultaneously during navigation in complex\nenvironments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u516d\u8db3\u5bfc\u76f2\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u529b-\u987a\u5e94\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\uff08FC-MPC\uff09\u548c\u673a\u5668\u4eba-\u7528\u6237\u63a7\u5236\u5c4f\u969c\u51fd\u6570\uff08CBFs\uff09\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u53cc\u5411\u4ea4\u4e92\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u5bfc\u822a\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u89c6\u969c\u4eba\u58eb\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u65f6\u53cc\u5411\u4ea4\u4e92\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u969c\u7684\u5bfc\u822a\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408FC-MPC\u548cCBFs\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u9012\u5f52\u6700\u5c0f\u4e8c\u4e58\u6cd5\uff08RLS\uff09\u4f30\u8ba1\u7528\u6237\u65bd\u52a0\u7684\u529b\uff0c\u8c03\u6574\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8fd0\u52a8\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u516b\u5411\u8fde\u63a5DBSCAN\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u969c\u788d\u7269\u805a\u7c7b\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728HexGuide\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u9002\u5e94\u7528\u6237\u529b\u6307\u4ee4\u5e76\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u969c\u7528\u6237\u548c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u3002", "conclusion": "FC-MPC\u548cCBFs\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u529b\u987a\u5e94\u5bfc\u822a\u548c\u969c\u788d\u7269\u907f\u969c\u3002"}}

We further present\nFaceMat, a trimap-free, uncertainty-aware framework that predicts high-quality\nalpha mattes under complex occlusions. Our approach leverages a two-stage\ntraining pipeline: a teacher model is trained to jointly estimate alpha mattes\nand per-pixel uncertainty using a negative log-likelihood (NLL) loss, and this\nuncertainty is then used to guide the student model through spatially adaptive\nknowledge distillation. This formulation enables the student to focus on\nambiguous or occluded regions, improving generalization and preserving semantic\nconsistency. Unlike previous approaches that rely on trimaps or segmentation\nmasks, our framework requires no auxiliary inputs making it well-suited for\nreal-time applications. In addition, we reformulate the matting objective by\nexplicitly treating skin as foreground and occlusions as background, enabling\nclearer compositing strategies. To support this task, we newly constructed\nCelebAMat, a large-scale synthetic dataset specifically designed for\nocclusion-aware face matting. Extensive experiments show that FaceMat\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks, enhancing the\nvisual quality and robustness of face filters in real-world, unconstrained\nvideo scenarios.

In the frequency\ndomain branch, we harness Mamba's exceptional capability to extract global\ncontextual information in conjunction with the synergistic effect of frequency\ndomain features to further enhance global modeling. Moreover, we design a 3D\nmulti-directional scanning mechanism to strengthen the fusion of local and\nglobal cues.

However, existing feedforward\napproaches typically assume that input multi-view images are clean and\nhigh-quality. In real-world scenarios, images are often captured under\nchallenging conditions such as noise, low light, or rain, resulting in\ninaccurate geometry and degraded 3D reconstruction. To address these\nchallenges, we propose a general and efficient multi-view feature enhancement\nmodule, RobustGS, which substantially improves the robustness of feedforward\n3DGS methods under various adverse imaging conditions, enabling high-quality 3D\nreconstruction. The RobustGS module can be seamlessly integrated into existing\npretrained pipelines in a plug-and-play manner to enhance reconstruction\nrobustness. Specifically, we introduce a novel component, Generalized\nDegradation Learner, designed to extract generic representations and\ndistributions of multiple degradations from multi-view inputs, thereby\nenhancing degradation-awareness and improving the overall quality of 3D\nreconstruction.

Moreover, standard RL methods require\nmillions of real-world interactions, posing a major bottleneck for practical\nfine-tuning. Although prior work frames the denoising process in diffusion\npolicies as a Markov Decision Process to enable RL-based updates, its strong\ndependence on environment interaction remains highly inefficient. To bridge\nthis gap, we introduce DiWA, a novel framework that leverages a world model for\nfine-tuning diffusion-based robotic skills entirely offline with reinforcement\nlearning. Unlike model-free approaches that require millions of environment\ninteractions to fine-tune a repertoire of robot skills, DiWA achieves effective\nadaptation using a world model trained once on a few hundred thousand offline\nplay interactions. This results in dramatically improved sample efficiency,\nmaking the approach significantly more practical and safer for real-world robot\nlearning. On the challenging CALVIN benchmark, DiWA improves performance across\neight tasks using only offline adaptation, while requiring orders of magnitude\nfewer physical interactions than model-free baselines. To our knowledge, this\nis the first demonstration of fine-tuning diffusion policies for real-world\nrobotic skills using an offline world model.

However, most existing FSL methods rely on entangled\nrepresentations, requiring the model to implicitly recover the unmixing process\nto obtain disentangled representations using only limited supervision, which\nhinders effective adaptation. Recent theoretical studies show that multimodal\ncontrastive learning methods, such as CLIP, can disentangle latent\nrepresentations up to linear transformations. In light of this, we propose the\nCausal CLIP Adapter (CCA), a novel framework that explicitly disentangles\nvisual features extracted from CLIP using unsupervised Independent Component\nAnalysis (ICA). This removes the need to learn the unmixing process from the\nlabeled data, thereby reducing the number of trainable parameters and\nmitigating overfitting. Taking a step further, while ICA can obtain visual\ndisentangled representations, it may also disrupt CLIP's intra- and inter-modal\nalignment. To counteract this, CCA further leverages CLIP's inherent\ncross-modal alignment by enhancing it in two ways: unidirectionally, through\nfine-tuning a CLIP-based text classifier, and bidirectionally, via a\ncross-attention mechanism that enriches visual and textual representations\nthrough mutual interaction. Both unimodal and cross-modal classification\noutputs can be effectively combined linearly to improve classification\naccuracy.

A necessary enabler to this capability is to\nfind and track features on a continuous stream of images. Existing methods,\nsuch as SIFT, ORB and AKAZE, achieve real-time but inaccurate pose estimates,\nwhereas modern deep learning methods yield higher quality features at the cost\nof more demanding computational resources which might not be available on\nspace-qualified hardware. Additionally, both classical and data-driven methods\nare not robust to the highly opaque self-cast shadows on the object of\ninterest. We show that, as the target body rotates, these shadows may lead to\nlarge biases in the resulting pose estimates. For these objects, a bias in the\nreal-time pose estimation algorithm may mislead the spacecraft's state\nestimator and cause a mission failure, especially if the body undergoes a\nchaotic tumbling motion. We present COFFEE, the Celestial Occlusion Fast\nFEature Extractor, a real-time pose estimation framework for asteroids designed\nto leverage prior information on the sun phase angle given by sun-tracking\nsensors commonly available onboard spacecraft. By associating salient contours\nto their projected shadows, a sparse set of features are detected, invariant to\nthe motion of the shadows. A Sparse Neural Network followed by an\nattention-based Graph Neural Network feature matching model are then jointly\ntrained to provide a set of correspondences between successive frames.

However, existing datasets focus mainly on short-term,\nhigh-resolution imagery from a limited number of satellites, overlooking\nlow-resolution, multi-satellite, long-term archives, such as Landsat, that are\nessential for affordable and bias-robust global monitoring. We address this gap\nwith Landsat30-AU, a large-scale vision-language dataset built from 30-meter\nresolution imagery collected by four Landsat satellites (5, 7, 8, and 9) over\nAustralia, spanning more than 36 years. The dataset includes two components:\nLandsat30-AU-Cap, containing 196,262 image-caption pairs, and Landsat30-AU-VQA,\ncomprising 17,725 human-verified visual question answering (VQA) samples across\neight remote sensing domains. Both datasets are curated through a bootstrapped\npipeline that leverages generic VLMs with iterative refinement and human\nverification to ensure quality. Our evaluation of eight VLMs on our benchmark\nreveals that off-the-shelf models struggle to understand satellite imagery.

This pipeline maintains the strong capability of understanding VLM\nwhile enabling the image generation ability of the unified VLM. Although this\npipeline has shown very promising potential for the future development of\nunified VLM, how to easily enable image editing capability is still unexplored.\nIn this paper, we introduce a novel training-free framework named UniEdit-I to\nenable the unified VLM with image editing capability via three iterative steps:\nunderstanding, editing, and verifying. 1. The understanding step analyzes the\nsource image to create a source prompt through structured semantic analysis and\nmakes minimal word replacements to form the target prompt based on the editing\ninstruction. 2. The editing step introduces a time-adaptive offset, allowing\nfor coherent editing from coarse to fine throughout the denoising process. 3.\nThe verification step checks the alignment between the target prompt and the\nintermediate edited image, provides automatic consistency scores and corrective\nfeedback, and determines whether to stop early or continue the editing loop.\nThis understanding, editing, and verifying loop iterates until convergence,\ndelivering high-fidelity editing in a training-free manner.

However, when detectors learn\nnew forgery types, their performance on previous types often degrades rapidly,\na phenomenon known as catastrophic forgetting. Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks\n(KANs) utilize locally plastic splines as their activation functions, enabling\nthem to learn new tasks by modifying only local regions of the functions while\nleaving other areas unaffected. Therefore, they are naturally suitable for\naddressing catastrophic forgetting. However, KANs have two significant\nlimitations: 1) the splines are ineffective for modeling high-dimensional\nimages, while alternative activation functions that are suitable for images\nlack the essential property of locality; 2) in continual learning, when\nfeatures from different domains overlap, the mapping of different domains to\ndistinct curve regions always collapses due to repeated modifications of the\nsame regions. In this paper, we propose a KAN-based Continual Face Forgery\nDetection (KAN-CFD) framework, which includes a Domain-Group KAN Detector\n(DG-KD) and a data-free replay Feature Separation strategy via KAN Drift\nCompensation Projection (FS-KDCP).

In clinical practice, optical coherence tomography\nangiography (OCTA) is commonly used for studying CNV-related pathological\nchanges, due to its micron-level resolution and non-invasive nature. Thus,\naccurate segmentation of CNV regions and vessels in OCTA images is crucial for\nclinical assessment of wet AMD. However, challenges existed due to irregular\nCNV shapes and imaging limitations like projection artifacts, noises and\nboundary blurring. Moreover, the lack of publicly available datasets\nconstraints the CNV analysis. To address these challenges, this paper\nconstructs the first publicly accessible CNV dataset (CNVSeg), and proposes a\nnovel multilateral graph convolutional interaction-enhanced CNV segmentation\nnetwork (MTG-Net). This network integrates both region and vessel morphological\ninformation, exploring semantic and geometric duality constraints within the\ngraph domain. Specifically, MTG-Net consists of a multi-task framework and two\ngraph-based cross-task modules: Multilateral Interaction Graph Reasoning (MIGR)\nand Multilateral Reinforcement Graph Reasoning (MRGR). The multi-task framework\nencodes rich geometric features of lesion shapes and surfaces, decoupling the\nimage into three task-specific feature maps. MIGR and MRGR iteratively reason\nabout higher-order relationships across tasks through a graph mechanism,\nenabling complementary optimization for task-specific objectives. Additionally,\nan uncertainty-weighted loss is proposed to mitigate the impact of artifacts\nand noise on segmentation accuracy.

While the challenges in\nhigh-level perception and planning are continually addressed along the progress\nof general large pre-trained models, the low precision of low-level action\nestimation has emerged as the key limiting factor in manipulation performance.\nTo this end, this paper introduces a novel robot manipulation framework, i.e.,\nActionSink, to pave the way toward precise action estimations in the field of\nlearning-based robot manipulation. As the name suggests, ActionSink\nreformulates the actions of robots as action-caused optical flows from videos,\ncalled \"action flow\", in a self-supervised manner, which are then used to be\nretrieved and integrated to enhance the action estimation. Specifically,\nActionSink incorporates two primary modules. The first module is a\ncoarse-to-fine action flow matcher, which continuously refines the accuracy of\naction flow via iterative retrieval and denoising process. The second module is\na dynamic action flow integrator, which employs a working memory pool that\ndynamically and efficiently manages the historical action flows that should be\nused to integrate to enhance the current action estimation. In this module, a\nmulti-layer fusion module is proposed to integrate direct estimation and action\nflows from both the current and the working memory, achieving highly accurate\naction estimation through a series of estimation-integration processes.

Real-world data acquisition is\nconstrained by the difficulty of collecting large-scale paired images, while\nexisting synthetic approaches often suffer from limited realism or\ninconsistencies between bare and makeup images.

In this work, we present FFHQ-Makeup, a high-quality\nsynthetic makeup dataset that pairs each identity with multiple makeup styles\nwhile preserving facial consistency in both identity and expression. Built upon\nthe diverse FFHQ dataset, our pipeline transfers real-world makeup styles from\nexisting datasets onto 18K identities by introducing an improved makeup\ntransfer method that disentangles identity and makeup.

It is typically divided into two subtasks: recognizing the performed\nbehavior (i.e., verb component) and identifying the objects being acted upon\n(i.e., noun component) from the first-person perspective. However, most\nexisting approaches treat these two components as independent classification\ntasks, focusing on extracting component-specific knowledge while overlooking\ntheir inherent semantic and contextual relationships, leading to fragmented\nrepresentations and sub-optimal generalization capability. To address these\nchallenges, we propose a prompt learning-based framework, EgoPrompt, to conduct\nthe egocentric action recognition task. Building on the existing prompting\nstrategy to capture the component-specific knowledge, we construct a Unified\nPrompt Pool space to establish interaction between the two types of component\nrepresentations. Specifically, the component representations (from verbs and\nnouns) are first decomposed into fine-grained patterns with the prompt pair\nform. Then, these pattern-level representations are fused through an\nattention-based mechanism to facilitate cross-component interaction. To ensure\nthe prompt pool is informative, we further introduce a novel training\nobjective, Diverse Pool Criteria.

By leveraging barometric\nreadings, we estimate sensor height changes, which provide valuable cues for\nboth improving the accuracy of human pose estimation and predicting global\ntranslation on non-flat terrain. Furthermore, we propose a local thigh\ncoordinate frame to disentangle local and global motion input for better pose\nrepresentation learning.

Most existing CSAL methods rely on Self-Supervised Learning\n(SSL) on the target dataset for feature extraction, which is inefficient and\nlimited by insufficient feature representation. Recently, pre-trained\nFoundation Models (FMs) have shown powerful feature extraction ability with a\npotential for better CSAL. However, this paradigm has been rarely investigated,\nwith a lack of benchmarks for comparison of FMs in CSAL tasks. To this end, we\npropose MedCAL-Bench, the first systematic FM-based CSAL benchmark for medical\nimage analysis. We evaluate 14 FMs and 7 CSAL strategies across 7 datasets\nunder different annotation budgets, covering classification and segmentation\ntasks from diverse medical modalities.

However, the extremely slow\ninference speed severely limits the practical implementation of diffusion-based\ntalking head generation models. In this study, we propose READ, the first\nreal-time diffusion-transformer-based talking head generation framework. Our\napproach first learns a spatiotemporal highly compressed video latent space via\na temporal VAE, significantly reducing the token count to accelerate\ngeneration. To achieve better audio-visual alignment within this compressed\nlatent space, a pre-trained Speech Autoencoder (SpeechAE) is proposed to\ngenerate temporally compressed speech latent codes corresponding to the video\nlatent space. These latent representations are then modeled by a carefully\ndesigned Audio-to-Video Diffusion Transformer (A2V-DiT) backbone for efficient\ntalking head synthesis.

However, their high computational cost and large\nparameter sizes pose significant challenges for usage in resource-constrained\nscenarios. Post-training quantization (PTQ) is a promising solution to reduce\nmemory usage and accelerate inference, but existing PTQ methods suffer from\nsevere performance degradation under extreme low-bit settings. We identify two\nkey obstacles to low-bit post-training quantization for DiT models: (1) model\nweights follow a Gaussian-like distribution with long tails, causing uniform\nquantization to poorly allocate intervals and leading to significant errors;\n(2) two types of activation outliers: (i) Mild Outliers with slightly elevated\nvalues, and (ii) Salient Outliers with large magnitudes concentrated in\nspecific channels, which disrupt activation quantization. To address these\nissues, we propose LRQ-DiT, an efficient and accurate PTQ framework. We\nintroduce Twin-Log Quantization (TLQ), a log-based method that aligns well with\nthe weight distribution and reduces quantization errors. We also propose an\nAdaptive Rotation Scheme (ARS) that dynamically applies Hadamard or\noutlier-aware rotations based on activation fluctuation, effectively mitigating\nthe impact of both types of outliers. We evaluate LRQ-DiT on PixArt and FLUX\nunder various bit-width settings, and validate the performance on COCO, MJHQ,\nand sDCI datasets.

To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose a novel distribution-aware knowledge unification and\nassociation (DKUA) framework where domain-style modeling is performed for each\ninstance to propagate domain-specific representations, enhancing\nanti-forgetting and generalization capacity. Specifically, we design a\ndistribution-aware model to transfer instance-level representations of the\ncurrent domain into the domain-specific representations with the different\ndomain styles, preserving learned knowledge without storing old samples. Next,\nwe propose adaptive knowledge consolidation (AKC) to dynamically generate the\nunified representation as a cross-domain representation center. To further\nmitigate forgetting, we develop a unified knowledge association (UKA)\nmechanism, which explores the unified representation as a bridge to explicitly\nmodel inter-domain associations, reducing inter-domain gaps. Finally,\ndistribution-based knowledge transfer (DKT) is proposed to prevent the current\ndomain distribution from deviating from the cross-domain distribution center,\nimproving adaptation capacity.

Traditional methods\nlike capture-recapture, distance sampling, or camera traps are well-established\nbut labour-intensive or spatially constrained. Using thermal (IR) and RGB\nimagery, drones enable efficient, non-intrusive animal counting. Our surveys\nwere conducted during the leafless period on single days in October and\nNovember 2024 in three areas of a sub-Illyrian hill and terrace landscape.\nFlight transects were based on predefined launch points using a 350 m grid and\nan algorithm that defined the direction of systematically randomized transects.\nThis setup allowed surveying large areas in one day using multiple drones,\nminimizing double counts. Flight altitude was set at 60 m to avoid disturbing\nroe deer (Capreolus capreolus) while ensuring detection. Animals were manually\nannotated in the recorded imagery and extrapolated to densities per square\nkilometer. We applied three extrapolation methods with increasing complexity:\nnaive area-based extrapolation, bootstrapping, and zero-inflated negative\nbinomial modelling. For comparison, a Random Encounter Model (REM) estimate was\ncalculated using camera trap data from the flight period. The drone-based\nmethods yielded similar results, generally showing higher densities than REM,\nexcept in one area in October.

These engaging user-generated\ncontent are characterised by their reuse of visual elements also found in other\nmemes. Matching instances of memes via these shared visual elements, called\nMeme Matching, is the basis of a wealth of meme analysis approaches. However,\nmost existing methods assume that every meme consists of a shared visual\nbackground, called a Template, with some overlaid text, thereby limiting meme\nmatching to comparing the background image alone. Current approaches exclude\nthe many memes that are not template-based and limit the effectiveness of\nautomated meme analysis and would not be effective at linking memes to\ncontemporary web-based meme dictionaries. In this work, we introduce a broader\nformulation of meme matching that extends beyond template matching. We show\nthat conventional similarity measures, including a novel segment-wise\ncomputation of the similarity measures, excel at matching template-based memes\nbut fall short when applied to non-template-based meme formats.
