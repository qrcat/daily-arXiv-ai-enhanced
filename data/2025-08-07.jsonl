We\npresent Constraint-Preserving Data Generation (CP-Gen), a method that uses a\nsingle expert trajectory to generate robot demonstrations containing novel\nobject geometries and poses. These generated demonstrations are used to train\nclosed-loop visuomotor policies that transfer zero-shot to the real world and\ngeneralize across variations in object geometries and poses. Similar to prior\nwork using pose variations for data generation, CP-Gen first decomposes expert\ndemonstrations into free-space motions and robot skills. But unlike those\nworks, we achieve geometry-aware data generation by formulating robot skills as\nkeypoint-trajectory constraints: keypoints on the robot or grasped object must\ntrack a reference trajectory defined relative to a task-relevant object. To\ngenerate a new demonstration, CP-Gen samples pose and geometry transforms for\neach task-relevant object, then applies these transforms to the object and its\nassociated keypoints or keypoint trajectories. We optimize robot joint\nconfigurations so that the keypoints on the robot or grasped object track the\ntransformed keypoint trajectory, and then motion plan a collision-free path to\nthe first optimized joint configuration. Experiments on 16 simulation tasks and\nfour real-world tasks, featuring multi-stage, non-prehensile and\ntight-tolerance manipulation, show that policies trained using CP-Gen achieve\nan average success rate of 77%, outperforming the best baseline that achieves\nan average of 50%."}

This study proposes two innovative approaches to\nenhance measurement accuracy using multiple known reference parts: a conversion\nfactor-based method and a pixel-based method. In the first approach, the\nconversion factor is estimated from known references to calculate the diameter\n(mm) of the unknown part. In the second approach, the diameter (mm) is directly\nestimated using pixel-based diameter information from the references. The\nexperimental setup includes an industrial-grade camera and telecentric lenses.\nTests conducted on glass samples (1-12 mm) and metal workpieces (3-24 mm) show\nthat measurement errors, which originally ranged from 13-114 micrometers, were\nreduced to 1-2 micrometers using the proposed methods.

To address these limitations, we propose LLM4-IC8K, a novel\nframework that treats IC mechanical drawings as images and leverages LLMs for\nstructured geometric interpretation. To mimic the step-by-step reasoning\napproach used by human engineers, LLM4-IC8K addresses three sub-tasks:\nperceiving the number of pins, computing the center coordinates of each pin,\nand estimating the dimensions of individual pins. We present a two-stage\nframework that first trains LMMs on synthetically generated IC footprint\ndiagrams to learn fundamental geometric reasoning and then fine-tunes them on\nreal-world datasheet drawings to enhance robustness and accuracy in practical\nscenarios. To support this, we introduce ICGeo8K, a multi-modal dataset with\n8,608 labeled samples, including 4138 hand-crafted IC footprint samples and\n4470 synthetically generated samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate that\nour model outperforms state-of-the-art LMMs on the proposed benchmark."}

The limitation arises from MLLMs'\ncontext limit and training costs, necessitating sparse frame sampling before\nfeeding videos into MLLMs. Existing video MLLMs adopt training-free uniform\nsampling or keyframe search, which may miss critical events or be constrained\nby the pre-trained models' event understanding capabilities. Meanwhile,\nbuilding a training-based method remains challenging due to the unsupervised\nand non-differentiable nature of sparse frame sampling. To address these\nproblems, we propose Temporal Sampling Policy Optimization (TSPO), advancing\nMLLMs' long-form video-language understanding via reinforcement learning.\nSpecifically, we first propose a trainable event-aware temporal agent, which\ncaptures event-query correlation for performing probabilistic keyframe\nselection. Then, we propose the TSPO reinforcement learning paradigm, which\nmodels keyframe selection and language generation as a joint decision-making\nprocess, enabling end-to-end group relative optimization with efficient\nrule-based rewards. Furthermore, for the TSPO's training, we propose a long\nvideo training data construction pipeline with comprehensive temporal data and\nvideo Needle-in-a-Haystack data.

In this paper, we revisit\nlogit-based distillation and reveal an underexplored yet critical element:\nTop-K knowledge. Motivated by this insight, we propose Top-scaled Knowledge\nDistillation (TopKD), a simple, efficient, and architecture-agnostic framework\nthat significantly enhances logit-based distillation. TopKD consists of two\nmain components: (1) a Top-K Scaling Module (TSM), which adaptively amplifies\nthe most informative logits, and (2) a Top-K Decoupled Loss (TDL), which offers\ntargeted and effective supervision. Notably, TopKD integrates seamlessly into\nexisting KD methods without introducing extra modules or requiring\narchitectural changes. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100, ImageNet, STL-10,\nand Tiny-ImageNet demonstrate that TopKD consistently surpasses\nstate-of-the-art distillation methods. Moreover, our method demonstrates\nsubstantial effectiveness when distilling Vision Transformers, underscoring its\nversatility across diverse network architectures. These findings highlight the\nsignificant potential of logits to advance knowledge distillation."}

The existing OnVTG models employ memory to\nstore recent historical video frame features and predict scores indicating\nwhether the current frame corresponds to the start or end time of the target\nevent.
