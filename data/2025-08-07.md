### [1] [Text2VR: Automated instruction Generation in Virtual Reality using Large language Models for Assembly Task](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03699)
*Subin Raj Peter*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出一种利用大型语言模型（LLM）自动从文本生成虚拟指令的方法，以解决VR培训内容开发的高成本问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VR培训虽高效，但内容开发耗时耗力，需自动化解决方案。

Abstract: Virtual Reality (VR) has emerged as a powerful tool for workforce training,
offering immersive, interactive, and risk-free environments that enhance skill
acquisition, decision-making, and confidence. Despite its advantages,
developing VR applications for training remains a significant challenge due to
the time, expertise, and resources required to create accurate and engaging
instructional content. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a
novel approach that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the
generation of virtual instructions from textual input. The system comprises two
core components: an LLM module that extracts task-relevant information from the
text, and an intelligent module that transforms this information into animated
demonstrations and visual cues within a VR environment. The intelligent module
receives input from the LLM module and interprets the extracted information.
Based on this, an instruction generator creates training content using relevant
data from a database. The instruction generator generates the instruction by
changing the color of virtual objects and creating animations to illustrate
tasks. This approach enhances training effectiveness and reduces development
overhead, making VR-based training more scalable and adaptable to evolving
industrial needs.

### [2] [Outlier Detection Algorithm for Circle Fitting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03720)
*Ahmet Gökhan Poyraz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于极坐标的异常值检测算法（PCOD），用于提高圆拟合在噪声数据中的准确性，并在工业应用中验证其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 圆拟合方法在工业中广泛应用，但噪声数据会显著降低其效果。为解决这一问题，研究提出了一种新的异常值检测算法。

Method: 将点集转换为极坐标，计算局部和全局标准差，通过比较局部均值与全局标准差识别异常值。

Result: 在工业垫圈零件的高精度直径测量中，PCOD算法优于其他方法，表现出更高的准确性。

Conclusion: PCOD算法在圆拟合应用中具有潜力，可提升工业环境中的测量精度。

Abstract: Circle fitting methods are extensively utilized in various industries,
particularly in quality control processes and design applications. The
effectiveness of these algorithms can be significantly compromised when the
point sets to be predicted are noisy. To mitigate this issue, outlier detection
and removal algorithms are often applied before the circle fitting procedure.
This study introduces the Polar Coordinate-Based Outlier Detection (PCOD)
algorithm, which can be effectively employed in circle fitting applications. In
the proposed approach, the point set is first transformed into polar
coordinates, followed by the calculation of both local and global standard
deviations. Outliers are then identified by comparing local mean values with
the global standard deviation. The practicality and efficiency of the proposed
method are demonstrated by focusing on the high-precision diameter measurement
of industrial washer parts. Images from a machine vision system are processed
through preprocessing steps, including sub-pixel edge detection. The resulting
sub-pixel edge points are then cleaned using the proposed outlier detection and
removal algorithm, after which circle fitting is performed. A comparison is
made using ten different circle fitting algorithms and five distinct outlier
detection methods. The results indicate that the proposed method outperforms
the other approaches, delivering the best performance in terms of accuracy
within the dataset, thereby demonstrating its potential for enhancing circle
fitting applications in industrial environments.

### [3] [Enhancing Diameter Measurement Accuracy in Machine Vision Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03721)
*Ahmet Gokhan Poyraz,Ahmet Emir Dirik,Hakan Gurkan,Mehmet Kacmaz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出两种新方法（转换因子法和像素法）以提高相机测量系统的精度，通过已知参考部件减少误差，实验显示误差从13-114微米降至1-2微米。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在测量不同直径部件时，现有系统因机械和软件因素导致误差，需提高精度。

Method: 使用转换因子法和像素法，基于已知参考部件计算未知部件直径。

Result: 实验证明误差显著降低至1-2微米，适用于玻璃和金属样品。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升测量精度和可靠性，适用于工业应用。

Abstract: In camera measurement systems, specialized equipment such as telecentric
lenses is often employed to measure parts with narrow tolerances. However,
despite the use of such equipment, measurement errors can occur due to
mechanical and software-related factors within the system. These errors are
particularly evident in applications where parts of different diameters are
measured using the same setup. This study proposes two innovative approaches to
enhance measurement accuracy using multiple known reference parts: a conversion
factor-based method and a pixel-based method. In the first approach, the
conversion factor is estimated from known references to calculate the diameter
(mm) of the unknown part. In the second approach, the diameter (mm) is directly
estimated using pixel-based diameter information from the references. The
experimental setup includes an industrial-grade camera and telecentric lenses.
Tests conducted on glass samples (1-12 mm) and metal workpieces (3-24 mm) show
that measurement errors, which originally ranged from 13-114 micrometers, were
reduced to 1-2 micrometers using the proposed methods. By utilizing only a few
known reference parts, the proposed approach enables high-accuracy measurement
of all parts within the camera's field of view. Additionally, this method
enhances the existing diameter measurement literature by significantly reducing
error rates and improving measurement reliability.

Abstract: This study investigates the integration of trustworthy prior reasoning
knowledge from MLLMs into multimodal emotion recognition. We employ Gemini to
generate fine-grained, modality-separable reasoning traces, which are injected
as priors during the fusion stage to enrich cross-modal interactions. To
mitigate the pronounced class-imbalance in multimodal emotion recognition, we
introduce Balanced Dual-Contrastive Learning, a loss formulation that jointly
balances inter-class and intra-class distributions. Applied to the MER2024
benchmark, our prior-enhanced framework yields substantial performance gains,
demonstrating that the reliability of MLLM-derived reasoning can be
synergistically combined with the domain adaptability of lightweight fusion
networks for robust, scalable emotion recognition.

lack of robustness in complex environments, and high computational demands, and
propose promising future directions, including improving temporal reasoning and
multimodal fusion, leveraging foundation models for better generalization and
few-shot learning, reducing reliance on labeled data through selfand weakly

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出LLM4-IC8K框架，利用LLM解决IC机械图纸的几何标注问题，通过两阶段训练和ICGeo8K数据集提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法无法自动化解析IC机械图纸的几何标注，且当前LMM在几何感知上表现不佳。

Method: 提出LLM4-IC8K框架，分两阶段训练LMM，先学习合成数据的基础几何推理，再微调于真实数据。

Result: 实验表明，LLM4-IC8K在ICGeo8K数据集上优于现有LMM。

Conclusion: LLM4-IC8K为IC机械图纸的自动化几何标注提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Printed-Circuit-board (PCB) footprint geometry labeling of integrated
circuits (IC) is essential in defining the physical interface between
components and the PCB layout, requiring exceptional visual perception
proficiency. However, due to the unstructured footprint drawing and abstract
diagram annotations, automated parsing and accurate footprint geometry modeling
remain highly challenging. Despite its importance, no methods currently exist
for automated package geometry labeling directly from IC mechanical drawings.
In this paper, we first investigate the visual perception performance of Large
Multimodal Models (LMMs) when solving IC footprint geometry understanding. Our
findings reveal that current LMMs severely suffer from inaccurate geometric
perception, which hinders their performance in solving the footprint geometry
labeling problem. To address these limitations, we propose LLM4-IC8K, a novel
framework that treats IC mechanical drawings as images and leverages LLMs for
structured geometric interpretation. To mimic the step-by-step reasoning
approach used by human engineers, LLM4-IC8K addresses three sub-tasks:
perceiving the number of pins, computing the center coordinates of each pin,
and estimating the dimensions of individual pins. We present a two-stage
framework that first trains LMMs on synthetically generated IC footprint
diagrams to learn fundamental geometric reasoning and then fine-tunes them on
real-world datasheet drawings to enhance robustness and accuracy in practical
scenarios. To support this, we introduce ICGeo8K, a multi-modal dataset with
8,608 labeled samples, including 4138 hand-crafted IC footprint samples and
4470 synthetically generated samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our model outperforms state-of-the-art LMMs on the proposed benchmark.

Conclusion: 该方法为实际机器人部署提供了高效的热红外图像去噪解决方案。

Abstract: Thermal infrared imaging exhibits considerable potentials for robotic
perception tasks, especially in environments with poor visibility or
challenging lighting conditions. However, TIR images typically suffer from
heavy non-uniform fixed-pattern noise, complicating tasks such as object
detection, localization, and mapping. To address this, we propose a
diffusion-based TIR image denoising framework leveraging latent-space
representations and wavelet-domain optimization. Utilizing a pretrained stable
diffusion model, our method fine-tunes the model via a novel loss function
combining latent-space and discrete wavelet transform (DWT) / dual-tree complex
wavelet transform (DTCWT) losses. Additionally, we implement a cascaded
refinement stage to enhance fine details, ensuring high-fidelity denoising
results. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate superior performance of
our approach compared to state-of-the-art denoising methods. Furthermore, our
method exhibits robust zero-shot generalization to diverse and challenging
real-world TIR datasets, underscoring its effectiveness for practical robotic
deployment.

Abstract: Generating a coherent sequence of images that tells a visual story, using
text-to-image diffusion models, often faces the critical challenge of
maintaining subject consistency across all story scenes. Existing approaches,
which typically rely on fine-tuning or retraining models, are computationally
expensive, time-consuming, and often interfere with the model's pre-existing
capabilities. In this paper, we follow a training-free approach and propose an
efficient consistent-subject-generation method. This approach works seamlessly
with pre-trained diffusion models by introducing masked cross-image attention
sharing to dynamically align subject features across a batch of images, and
Regional Feature Harmonization to refine visually similar details for improved
subject consistency. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach
successfully generates visually consistent subjects across a variety of
scenarios while maintaining the creative abilities of the diffusion model.

Abstract: Environment mapping is an important computing task for a wide range of smart
city applications, including autonomous navigation, wireless network operations
and extended reality environments. Conventional smart city mapping techniques,
such as satellite imagery, LiDAR scans, and manual annotations, often suffer
from limitations related to cost, accessibility and accuracy. Open-source
mapping platforms have been widely utilized in artificial intelligence
applications for environment mapping, serving as a source of ground truth.
However, human errors and the evolving nature of real-world environments
introduce biases that can negatively impact the performance of neural networks
trained on such data. In this paper, we present a deep learning-based approach
that integrates the DINOv2 architecture to improve building mapping by
combining maps from open-source platforms with radio frequency (RF) data
collected from multiple wireless user equipments and base stations. Our
approach leverages a vision transformer-based architecture to jointly process
both RF and map modalities within a unified framework, effectively capturing
spatial dependencies and structural priors for enhanced mapping accuracy. For
the evaluation purposes, we employ a synthetic dataset co-produced by Huawei.
We develop and train a model that leverages only aggregated path loss
information to tackle the mapping problem. We measure the results according to
three performance metrics which capture different qualities: (i) The Jaccard
index, also known as intersection over union (IoU), (ii) the Hausdorff
distance, and (iii) the Chamfer distance. Our design achieves a macro IoU of
65.3%, significantly surpassing (i) the erroneous maps baseline, which yields
40.1%, (ii) an RF-only method from the literature, which yields 37.3%, and
(iii) a non-AI fusion baseline that we designed which yields 42.2%.

Conclusion: VQ-DeepISC为语义通信系统提供了一种高效且鲁棒的数字化解决方案。

Abstract: Discretization of semantic features enables interoperability between semantic
and digital communication systems, showing significant potential for practical
applications. The fundamental difficulty in digitizing semantic features stems
from the need to preserve continuity and context in inherently analog
representations during their compression into discrete symbols while ensuring
robustness to channel degradation. In this paper, we propose a vector quantized
(VQ)-enabled digital semantic communication system with channel adaptive image
transmission, named VQ-DeepISC. Guided by deep joint source-channel coding
(DJSCC), we first design a Swin Transformer backbone for hierarchical semantic
feature extraction, followed by VQ modules projecting features into discrete
latent spaces. Consequently, it enables efficient index-based transmission
instead of raw feature transmission. To further optimize this process, we
develop an attention mechanism-driven channel adaptation module to dynamically
optimize index transmission. Secondly, to counteract codebook collapse during
training process, we impose a distributional regularization by minimizing the
Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) between codeword usage frequencies and a
uniform prior. Meanwhile, exponential moving average (EMA) is employed to
stabilize training and ensure balanced feature coverage during codebook
updates. Finally, digital communication is implemented using quadrature phase
shift keying (QPSK) modulation alongside orthogonal frequency division
multiplexing (OFDM), adhering to the IEEE 802.11a standard. Experimental
results demonstrate superior reconstruction fidelity of the proposed system
over benchmark methods.

Abstract: Recent interest in geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI) has fostered a
wide range of applications using artificial intelligence (AI), especially deep
learning, for geospatial problem solving. However, major challenges such as a
lack of training data and the neglect of spatial principles and spatial effects
in AI model design remain, significantly hindering the in-depth integration of
AI with geospatial research. This paper reports our work in developing a deep
learning model that enables object detection, particularly of natural features,
in a weakly supervised manner. Our work makes three contributions: First, we
present a method of object detection using only weak labels. This is achieved
by developing a spatially explicit model based on Tobler's first law of
geography. Second, we incorporate attention maps into the object detection
pipeline and develop a multistage training strategy to improve performance.
Third, we apply this model to detect impact craters on Mars, a task that
previously required extensive manual effort. The model generalizes to both
natural and human-made features on the surfaces of Earth and other planets.
This research advances the theoretical and methodological foundations of GeoAI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确估计地铁站台拥挤度可提升运营决策能力，改善安全、效率和乘客体验，但现有方法依赖间接代理数据，实时性不足。

Conclusion: CCTV数据可独立支持实时拥挤度估计，为运营决策提供精确依据。

Abstract: Accurately estimating urban rail platform occupancy can enhance transit
agencies' ability to make informed operational decisions, thereby improving
safety, operational efficiency, and customer experience, particularly in the
context of crowding. However, sensing real-time crowding remains challenging
and often depends on indirect proxies such as automatic fare collection data or
staff observations. Recently, Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV) footage has
emerged as a promising data source with the potential to yield accurate,
real-time occupancy estimates. The presented study investigates this potential
by comparing three state-of-the-art computer vision approaches for extracting
crowd-related features from platform CCTV imagery: (a) object detection and
counting using YOLOv11, RT-DETRv2, and APGCC; (b) crowd-level classification
via a custom-trained Vision Transformer, Crowd-ViT; and (c) semantic
segmentation using DeepLabV3. Additionally, we present a novel, highly
efficient linear-optimization-based approach to extract counts from the
generated segmentation maps while accounting for image object depth and, thus,
for passenger dispersion along a platform. Tested on a privacy-preserving
dataset created in collaboration with the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit
Authority (WMATA) that encompasses more than 600 hours of video material, our
results demonstrate that computer vision approaches can provide substantive
value for crowd estimation. This work demonstrates that CCTV image data,
independent of other data sources available to a transit agency, can enable
more precise real-time crowding estimation and, eventually, timely operational
responses for platform crowding mitigation.

Conclusion: 提出的框架通过质量感知和动态路由策略，为精准农业中的杂草分割提供了高效且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper addresses the critical need for efficient and accurate weed
segmentation from drone video in precision agriculture. A quality-aware modular
deep-learning framework is proposed that addresses common image degradation by
analyzing quality conditions-such as blur and noise-and routing inputs through
specialized pre-processing and transformer models optimized for each
degradation type. The system first analyzes drone images for noise and blur
using Mean Absolute Deviation and the Laplacian. Data is then dynamically
routed to one of three vision transformer models: a baseline for clean images,
a modified transformer with Fisher Vector encoding for noise reduction, or
another with an unrolled Lucy-Robinson decoder to correct blur. This novel
routing strategy allows the system to outperform existing CNN-based methods in
both segmentation quality and computational efficiency, demonstrating a
significant advancement in deep-learning applications for agriculture.

Abstract: Minimal parametrization of 3D lines plays a critical role in camera
localization and structural mapping. Existing representations in robotics and
computer vision predominantly handle independent lines, overlooking structural
regularities such as sets of parallel lines that are pervasive in man-made
environments. This paper introduces \textbf{RiemanLine}, a unified minimal
representation for 3D lines formulated on Riemannian manifolds that jointly
accommodates both individual lines and parallel-line groups. Our key idea is to
decouple each line landmark into global and local components: a shared
vanishing direction optimized on the unit sphere $\mathcal{S}^2$, and scaled
normal vectors constrained on orthogonal subspaces, enabling compact encoding
of structural regularities. For $n$ parallel lines, the proposed representation
reduces the parameter space from $4n$ (orthonormal form) to $2n+2$, naturally
embedding parallelism without explicit constraints. We further integrate this
parameterization into a factor graph framework, allowing global direction
alignment and local reprojection optimization within a unified manifold-based
bundle adjustment. Extensive experiments on ICL-NUIM, TartanAir, and synthetic
benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves significantly more accurate
pose estimation and line reconstruction, while reducing parameter
dimensionality and improving convergence stability.

Abstract: The performance of machine learning models for automated invoice processing
is critically dependent on large-scale, diverse datasets. However, the
acquisition of such datasets is often constrained by privacy regulations and
the high cost of manual annotation. To address this, we present a novel
pipeline for generating high-fidelity, synthetic invoice documents and their
corresponding structured data. Our method first utilizes Optical Character
Recognition (OCR) to extract the text content and precise spatial layout from a
source invoice. Select data fields are then replaced with contextually
realistic, synthetic content generated by a large language model (LLM).
Finally, we employ an inpainting technique to erase the original text from the
image and render the new, synthetic text in its place, preserving the exact
layout and font characteristics. This process yields a pair of outputs: a
visually realistic new invoice image and a perfectly aligned structured data
file (JSON) reflecting the synthetic content. Our approach provides a scalable
and automated solution to amplify small, private datasets, enabling the
creation of large, varied corpora for training more robust and accurate

### [16] [OmniDepth: Bridging Monocular and Stereo Reasoning with Latent Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04611)
*Tongfan Guan,Jiaxin Guo,Chen Wang,Yun-Hui Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniDepth是一个统一框架，通过迭代双向对齐单目和立体深度估计的潜在表示，结合两者的优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单目方法具有丰富的上下文先验但缺乏几何精度，而立体方法利用极线几何但难以处理反射或无纹理表面。两者在实践中仍分离。

Method: OmniDepth通过跨注意力对齐机制动态同步单目上下文线索与立体假设表示，解决立体模糊性并优化单目深度。

Result: 实验表明，OmniDepth在Middlebury和ETH3D上的零样本泛化误差减少>40%，并解决了透明和反射表面的长期问题。

Conclusion: OmniDepth通过协调多视图几何与单目上下文，实现了超越模态限制的鲁棒3D感知。

Abstract: Monocular and stereo depth estimation offer complementary strengths:
monocular methods capture rich contextual priors but lack geometric precision,
while stereo approaches leverage epipolar geometry yet struggle with
ambiguities such as reflective or textureless surfaces. Despite post-hoc
synergies, these paradigms remain largely disjoint in practice. We introduce
OmniDepth, a unified framework that bridges both through iterative
bidirectional alignment of their latent representations. At its core, a novel
cross-attentive alignment mechanism dynamically synchronizes monocular
contextual cues with stereo hypothesis representations during stereo reasoning.
This mutual alignment resolves stereo ambiguities (e.g., specular surfaces) by
injecting monocular structure priors while refining monocular depth with stereo
geometry within a single network. Extensive experiments demonstrate
state-of-the-art results: \textbf{OmniDepth reduces zero-shot generalization
error by $\!>\!40\%$ on Middlebury and ETH3D}, while addressing longstanding
failures on transparent and reflective surfaces. By harmonizing multi-view
geometry with monocular context, OmniDepth enables robust 3D perception that
transcends modality-specific limitations. Codes available at

*Ziheng Jia,Jiaying Qian,Zicheng Zhang,Zijian Chen,Xiongkuo Min*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Refine-IQA提出多阶段强化微调框架，通过增强低层次视觉质量感知和监督“思考”过程，显著提升图像质量评估性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于RFT的IQA方法缺乏对“思考”过程的奖励监督，且未明确增强模型的低层次视觉质量感知，限制了性能上限。

Method: 分两阶段：第一阶段构建Refine-Perception-20K数据集并设计多任务奖励函数；第二阶段引入概率差异奖励策略监督“思考”过程。

Result: Refine-IQA系列模型在感知和评分任务中表现优异，并激活了强大的“思考”能力。

Conclusion: Refine-IQA通过多阶段设计和监督机制，显著提升了IQA任务的性能和模型解释能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) is a proliferating paradigm for LMM training.
Analogous to high-level reasoning tasks, RFT is similarly applicable to
low-level vision domains, including image quality assessment (IQA). Existing
RFT-based IQA methods typically use rule-based output rewards to verify the
model's rollouts but provide no reward supervision for the "think" process,
leaving its correctness and efficacy uncontrolled. Furthermore, these methods
typically fine-tune directly on downstream IQA tasks without explicitly
enhancing the model's native low-level visual quality perception, which may
constrain its performance upper bound. In response to these gaps, we propose
the multi-stage RFT IQA framework (Refine-IQA). In Stage-1, we build the
Refine-Perception-20K dataset (with 12 main distortions, 20,907
locally-distorted images, and over 55K RFT samples) and design multi-task
reward functions to strengthen the model's visual quality perception. In
Stage-2, targeting the quality scoring task, we introduce a probability
difference reward involved strategy for "think" process supervision. The
resulting Refine-IQA Series Models achieve outstanding performance on both
perception and scoring tasks-and, notably, our paradigm activates a robust
"think" (quality interpreting) capability that also attains exceptional results
on the corresponding quality interpreting benchmark.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 4D-PreNet是一个端到端的深度学习框架，用于解决4D-STEM数据预处理中的噪声、中心漂移和椭圆失真问题，显著提升数据质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高吞吐量4D-STEM数据采集中的噪声、中心漂移和椭圆失真导致定量测量偏差，传统算法缺乏通用性。

Method: 结合注意力增强的U-Net和ResNet架构，通过大规模模拟数据集训练，实现去噪、中心校正和椭圆失真校准。

Result: 去噪任务中均方误差降低50%，中心定位误差低于0.04像素，优于传统算法。

Conclusion: 4D-PreNet为自动化4D-STEM实时分析提供了可靠的高通量解决方案。

Abstract: Automated experimentation with real time data analysis in scanning
transmission electron microscopy (STEM) often require end-to-end framework. The
four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) with
high-throughput data acquisition has been constrained by the critical
bottleneck results from data preprocessing. Pervasive noise, beam center drift,
and elliptical distortions during high-throughput acquisition inevitably
corrupt diffraction patterns, systematically biasing quantitative measurements.
Yet, conventional correction algorithms are often material-specific and fail to
provide a robust, generalizable solution. In this work, we present 4D-PreNet,
an end-to-end deep-learning pipeline that integrates attention-enhanced U-Net
and ResNet architectures to simultaneously perform denoising, center
correction, and elliptical distortion calibration. The network is trained on
large, simulated datasets encompassing a wide range of noise levels, drift
magnitudes, and distortion types, enabling it to generalize effectively to
experimental data acquired under varying conditions. Quantitative evaluations
demonstrate that our pipeline reduces mean squared error by up to 50% during
denoising and achieves sub-pixel center localization in the center detection
task, with average errors below 0.04 pixels. The outputs are bench-marked
against traditional algorithms, highlighting improvements in both noise
suppression and restoration of diffraction patterns, thereby facilitating
high-throughput, reliable 4D-STEM real-time analysis for automated
characterization.

Abstract: Evaluating text-to-image generation models requires alignment with human
perception, yet existing human-centric metrics are constrained by limited data
coverage, suboptimal feature extraction, and inefficient loss functions. To
address these challenges, we introduce Human Preference Score v3 (HPSv3). (1)
We release HPDv3, the first wide-spectrum human preference dataset integrating
1.08M text-image pairs and 1.17M annotated pairwise comparisons from
state-of-the-art generative models and low to high-quality real-world images.
(2) We introduce a VLM-based preference model trained using an
uncertainty-aware ranking loss for fine-grained ranking. Besides, we propose
Chain-of-Human-Preference (CoHP), an iterative image refinement method that
enhances quality without extra data, using HPSv3 to select the best image at
each step. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HPSv3 serves as a robust
metric for wide-spectrum image evaluation, and CoHP offers an efficient and
human-aligned approach to improve image generation quality. The code and
dataset are available at the HPSv3 Homepage.

Motivation: 陨石坑的空间分布和形态特征对行星科学研究至关重要，深度学习模型的快速发展为自动化陨石坑检测提供了新机遇。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：第一阶段使用CNN、ResNet-50和YOLO进行陨石坑识别；第二阶段基于YOLO进行陨石坑定位。

Result: YOLO在陨石坑检测中表现最均衡，ResNet-50在大型陨石坑识别中精度更高。

Conclusion: 深度学习模型在陨石坑检测中具有显著潜力，YOLO和ResNet-50在不同任务中各有优势。

Abstract: Impact craters are among the most prominent geomorphological features on
planetary surfaces and are of substantial significance in planetary science
research. Their spatial distribution and morphological characteristics provide
critical information on planetary surface composition, geological history, and
impact processes. In recent years, the rapid advancement of deep learning
models has fostered significant interest in automated crater detection. In this
paper, we apply advancements in deep learning models for impact crater
detection and identification. We use novel models, including Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs) and variants such as YOLO and ResNet. We present a
framework that features a two-stage approach where the first stage features
crater identification using simple classic CNN, ResNet-50 and YOLO. In the
second stage, our framework employs YOLO-based detection for crater
localisation. Therefore, we detect and identify different types of craters and
present a summary report with remote sensing data for a selected region. We
consider selected regions for craters and identification from Mars and the Moon
based on remote sensing data. Our results indicate that YOLO demonstrates the
most balanced crater detection performance, while ResNet-50 excels in
identifying large craters with high precision.

TL;DR: 提出一种扩散模型，用于生成具有对应关系的点基形状表示，解决了现有深度学习方法忽略点对应关系的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统统计形状模型关注点对应关系，但当前深度学习方法仅处理无序点云，缺乏生成具有对应关系的形状的能力。

Method: 设计一种扩散模型，利用OASIS-3数据生成保持点对应关系的点基形状表示。

Result: 模型生成的形状高度逼真，并展示了在条件生成和疾病形态预测中的应用。

Conclusion: 该模型有效解决了点对应关系生成问题，并在下游任务中展现了实用价值。

Abstract: We propose a diffusion model designed to generate point-based shape
representations with correspondences. Traditional statistical shape models have
considered point correspondences extensively, but current deep learning methods
do not take them into account, focusing on unordered point clouds instead.
Current deep generative models for point clouds do not address generating
shapes with point correspondences between generated shapes. This work aims to
formulate a diffusion model that is capable of generating realistic point-based
shape representations, which preserve point correspondences that are present in
the training data. Using shape representation data with correspondences derived
from Open Access Series of Imaging Studies 3 (OASIS-3), we demonstrate that our
correspondence-preserving model effectively generates point-based hippocampal
shape representations that are highly realistic compared to existing methods.
We further demonstrate the applications of our generative model by downstream
tasks, such as conditional generation of healthy and AD subjects and predicting
morphological changes of disease progression by counterfactual generation.

Motivation: 放射科医生常混合使用多种医学图像阅读策略，但现有方法未能充分利用多模态和局部信息。

Method: 训练策略网络，推荐最佳成像模态和感兴趣区域，结合预训练分割网络动态迭代优化。

Result: 在1325例多参数MRI数据上验证，显著提升分割效率和准确性，甚至超越标准分割网络。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提升性能，还能独立发展出优化策略，有望辅助放射科医生。

Abstract: Radiologists often mix medical image reading strategies, including inspection
of individual modalities and local image regions, using information at
different locations from different images independently as well as
concurrently. In this paper, we propose a recommend system to assist machine
learning-based segmentation models, by suggesting appropriate image portions
along with the best modality, such that prostate cancer segmentation
performance can be maximised. Our approach trains a policy network that assists
tumor localisation, by recommending both the optimal imaging modality and the
specific sections of interest for review. During training, a pre-trained
segmentation network mimics radiologist inspection on individual or variable
combinations of these imaging modalities and their sections - selected by the
policy network. Taking the locally segmented regions as an input for the next
step, this dynamic decision making process iterates until all cancers are best
localised. We validate our method using a data set of 1325 labelled
multiparametric MRI images from prostate cancer patients, demonstrating its
potential to improve annotation efficiency and segmentation accuracy,
especially when challenging pathology is present. Experimental results show
that our approach can surpass standard segmentation networks. Perhaps more
interestingly, our trained agent independently developed its own optimal
strategy, which may or may not be consistent with current radiologist
guidelines such as PI-RADS. This observation also suggests a promising
interactive application, in which the proposed policy networks assist human
radiologists.

TL;DR: 提出了一种两阶段训练范式，利用噪声视频扩展音频同步视觉动画，减少对高质量手动标注的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖昂贵的手动标注视频，难以扩展到开放世界中的多样化音频-视频类别。

Method: 两阶段训练：第一阶段用噪声视频预训练，第二阶段用小规模高质量视频微调；引入多特征条件和窗口注意力增强同步。

Result: 方法减少手动标注需求10倍以上，并在AVSync48基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法高效扩展了音频同步视觉动画的应用范围，显著降低人工成本。

Abstract: Recent advances in audio-synchronized visual animation enable control of
video content using audios from specific classes. However, existing methods
rely heavily on expensive manual curation of high-quality, class-specific
training videos, posing challenges to scaling up to diverse audio-video classes
in the open world. In this work, we propose an efficient two-stage training
paradigm to scale up audio-synchronized visual animation using abundant but
noisy videos. In stage one, we automatically curate large-scale videos for
pretraining, allowing the model to learn diverse but imperfect audio-video
alignments. In stage two, we finetune the model on manually curated
high-quality examples, but only at a small scale, significantly reducing the
required human effort. We further enhance synchronization by allowing each
frame to access rich audio context via multi-feature conditioning and window
attention. To efficiently train the model, we leverage pretrained text-to-video
generator and audio encoders, introducing only 1.9\% additional trainable
parameters to learn audio-conditioning capability without compromising the
generator's prior knowledge. For evaluation, we introduce AVSync48, a benchmark
with videos from 48 classes, which is 3$\times$ more diverse than previous
benchmarks. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly reduces
reliance on manual curation by over 10$\times$, while generalizing to many open
classes.

TL;DR: RAVID是一个基于视觉检索增强生成（RAG）的AI生成图像检测框架，通过动态检索相关图像提升检测性能，结合CLIP和VLM技术，在UniversalFakeDetect基准测试中达到93.85%的平均准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检测方法依赖低层特征和模型特定信息，泛化性和鲁棒性不足，而RAG方法在视觉领域的应用尚未充分探索。

Method: RAVID利用微调的CLIP图像编码器（RAVID CLIP）和类别相关提示增强表示学习，结合VLM融合检索图像与查询图像。

Result: 在UniversalFakeDetect基准测试中，RAVID平均准确率达93.85%，在图像退化条件下仍保持80.27%的准确率，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RAVID通过视觉RAG显著提升了AI生成图像检测的性能和鲁棒性，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce RAVID, the first framework for AI-generated image
detection that leverages visual retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). While RAG
methods have shown promise in mitigating factual inaccuracies in foundation
models, they have primarily focused on text, leaving visual knowledge
underexplored. Meanwhile, existing detection methods, which struggle with
generalization and robustness, often rely on low-level artifacts and
model-specific features, limiting their adaptability. To address this, RAVID
dynamically retrieves relevant images to enhance detection. Our approach
utilizes a fine-tuned CLIP image encoder, RAVID CLIP, enhanced with
category-related prompts to improve representation learning. We further
integrate a vision-language model (VLM) to fuse retrieved images with the
query, enriching the input and improving accuracy. Given a query image, RAVID
generates an embedding using RAVID CLIP, retrieves the most relevant images
from a database, and combines these with the query image to form an enriched
input for a VLM (e.g., Qwen-VL or Openflamingo). Experiments on the
UniversalFakeDetect benchmark, which covers 19 generative models, show that
RAVID achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average accuracy of 93.85%.
RAVID also outperforms traditional methods in terms of robustness, maintaining
high accuracy even under image degradations such as Gaussian blur and JPEG
compression. Specifically, RAVID achieves an average accuracy of 80.27% under
degradation conditions, compared to 63.44% for the state-of-the-art model
C2P-CLIP, demonstrating consistent improvements in both Gaussian blur and JPEG
compression scenarios. The code will be publicly available upon acceptance.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大规模预训练数据集对仅使用2D图像进行营养估计的深度学习模型性能的影响，发现JFT-300M预训练模型显著优于公开数据集预训练模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 营养估计对健康监测至关重要，但仅依赖2D图像存在挑战，且现有方法依赖专有数据集，限制了可重复性。

Method: 使用ImageNet和COYO预训练的ViT模型，与CNN基线模型及JFT-300M预训练模型对比，在Nutrition5k数据集上进行实验。

Result: JFT-300M预训练模型表现最佳，COYO预训练模型表现不如ImageNet，出乎意料。

Conclusion: 预训练数据集的规模、领域相关性和质量对2D营养估计中的迁移学习至关重要。

Abstract: Estimating the nutritional content of food from images is a critical task
with significant implications for health and dietary monitoring. This is
challenging, especially when relying solely on 2D images, due to the
variability in food presentation, lighting, and the inherent difficulty in
inferring volume and mass without depth information. Furthermore,
reproducibility in this domain is hampered by the reliance of state-of-the-art
methods on proprietary datasets for large-scale pre-training. In this paper, we
investigate the impact of large-scale pre-training datasets on the performance
of deep learning models for nutritional estimation using only 2D images. We
fine-tune and evaluate Vision Transformer (ViT) models pre-trained on two large
public datasets, ImageNet and COYO, comparing their performance against
baseline CNN models (InceptionV2 and ResNet-50) and a state-of-the-art method
pre-trained on the proprietary JFT-300M dataset. We conduct extensive
experiments on the Nutrition5k dataset, a large-scale collection of real-world
food plates with high-precision nutritional annotations. Our evaluation using
Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAE%) reveals
that models pre-trained on JFT-300M significantly outperform those pre-trained
on public datasets. Unexpectedly, the model pre-trained on the massive COYO
dataset performs worse than the model pre-trained on ImageNet for this specific
regression task, refuting our initial hypothesis. Our analysis provides
quantitative evidence highlighting the critical role of pre-training dataset
characteristics, including scale, domain relevance, and curation quality, for
effective transfer learning in 2D nutritional estimation.

TL;DR: JanusNet是一种用于3D医学图像分割的数据增强框架，通过全局建模解剖连续性和局部关注难分割区域，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有数据增强方法破坏3D医学图像解剖连续性和对难分割区域训练不足的问题。

Method: 提出双阶段框架：Slice-Block Shuffle保持解剖连续性，Confidence-Guided Displacement增强难分割区域信号。

Result: 在Synapse和AMOS数据集上表现优异，例如在Synapse数据集上仅用20%标注数据就实现了4%的DSC提升。

Conclusion: JanusNet是一种即插即用的高效数据增强方法，显著优于现有技术。

Abstract: Limited by the scarcity of training samples and annotations, weakly
supervised medical image segmentation often employs data augmentation to
increase data diversity, while randomly mixing volumetric blocks has
demonstrated strong performance. However, this approach disrupts the inherent
anatomical continuity of 3D medical images along orthogonal axes, leading to
severe structural inconsistencies and insufficient training in challenging
regions, such as small-sized organs, etc. To better comply with and utilize
human anatomical information, we propose JanusNet}, a data augmentation
framework for 3D medical data that globally models anatomical continuity while
locally focusing on hard-to-segment regions. Specifically, our Slice-Block
Shuffle step performs aligned shuffling of same-index slice blocks across
volumes along a random axis, while preserving the anatomical context on planes
perpendicular to the perturbation axis. Concurrently, the Confidence-Guided
Displacement step uses prediction reliability to replace blocks within each
slice, amplifying signals from difficult areas. This dual-stage, axis-aligned
framework is plug-and-play, requiring minimal code changes for most
teacher-student schemes. Extensive experiments on the Synapse and AMOS datasets
demonstrate that JanusNet significantly surpasses state-of-the-art methods,
achieving, for instance, a 4% DSC gain on the Synapse dataset with only 20%
labeled data.

Result: 在挑战性CAD数据集上，该方法实现了最先进性能，同时保持高效。

Conclusion: CAD-Judge通过优化奖励系统和验证模块，显著提升了Text-to-CAD系统的效率和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) models are widely used across industrial design,
simulation, and manufacturing processes. Text-to-CAD systems aim to generate
editable, general-purpose CAD models from textual descriptions, significantly
reducing the complexity and entry barrier associated with traditional CAD
workflows. However, rendering CAD models can be slow, and deploying VLMs to
review CAD models can be expensive and may introduce reward hacking that
degrades the systems. To address these challenges, we propose CAD-Judge, a
novel, verifiable reward system for efficient and effective CAD preference
grading and grammatical validation. We adopt the Compiler-as-a-Judge Module
(CJM) as a fast, direct reward signal, optimizing model alignment by maximizing
generative utility through prospect theory. To further improve the robustness
of Text-to-CAD in the testing phase, we introduce a simple yet effective
agentic CAD generation approach and adopt the Compiler-as-a-Review Module
(CRM), which efficiently verifies the generated CAD models, enabling the system
to refine them accordingly. Extensive experiments on challenging CAD datasets
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while
maintaining superior efficiency.

Motivation: 视频扩散模型因联合建模时空信息导致长令牌序列，增加了校准方差和学习难度，需要高效的量化方法。

Method: 提出Hessian-aware Salient Data Selection和Attention-guided Sparse Token Distillation，优化校准数据选择和令牌蒸馏。

Conclusion: S²Q-VDiT为视频扩散模型提供了一种高效的量化解决方案，显著降低了计算成本。

Abstract: Diffusion transformers have emerged as the mainstream paradigm for video
generation models. However, the use of up to billions of parameters incurs
significant computational costs. Quantization offers a promising solution by
reducing memory usage and accelerating inference. Nonetheless, we observe that
the joint modeling of spatial and temporal information in video diffusion
models (V-DMs) leads to extremely long token sequences, which introduces high
calibration variance and learning challenges. To address these issues, we
propose \textbf{$\text{S}^2$Q-VDiT}, a post-training quantization framework for
V-DMs that leverages \textbf{S}alient data and \textbf{S}parse token
distillation. During the calibration phase, we identify that quantization
performance is highly sensitive to the choice of calibration data. To mitigate
this, we introduce \textit{Hessian-aware Salient Data Selection}, which
constructs high-quality calibration datasets by considering both diffusion and
quantization characteristics unique to V-DMs. To tackle the learning
challenges, we further analyze the sparse attention patterns inherent in V-DMs.
Based on this observation, we propose \textit{Attention-guided Sparse Token
Distillation}, which exploits token-wise attention distributions to emphasize
tokens that are more influential to the model's output. Under W4A6
quantization, $\text{S}^2$Q-VDiT achieves lossless performance while delivering
$3.9\times$ model compression and $1.3\times$ inference acceleration. Code will

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了输入审查能力评估框架（ISEval），用于评估大型多模态模型（LMMs）主动检测输入错误的能力，发现模型在无指导时难以识别错误，且表现因错误类型和模态信任而异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LMMs是否能够主动检测和审查错误输入，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 引入ISEval框架，包含七类缺陷前提和三个评估指标，对十种先进LMMs进行评估。

Result: 大多数模型在无指导时难以检测错误，表现因错误类型和模态信任而异。

Conclusion: 强调了增强LMMs主动验证输入有效性的紧迫性，并提供了新的解决思路。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have witnessed remarkable growth, showcasing
formidable capabilities in handling intricate multimodal tasks with exceptional
performance. Recent research has underscored the inclination of large language
models to passively accept defective inputs, often resulting in futile
reasoning on invalid prompts. However, the same critical question of whether
LMMs can actively detect and scrutinize erroneous inputs still remains
unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce the Input Scrutiny Ability
Evaluation Framework (ISEval), which encompasses seven categories of flawed
premises and three evaluation metrics. Our extensive evaluation of ten advanced
LMMs has identified key findings. Most models struggle to actively detect
flawed textual premises without guidance, which reflects a strong reliance on
explicit prompts for premise error identification. Error type affects
performance: models excel at identifying logical fallacies but struggle with
surface-level linguistic errors and certain conditional flaws. Modality trust

TL;DR: PDSSNet通过结合类语义和空间结构，解决了遥感图像语义分割中的高类内差异和高类间相似性问题，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 遥感图像语义分割中，高类内差异和高类间相似性导致传统方法分割结果不完整，现有类引导方法也因原型表示粗糙和忽略结构信息而受限。

Method: 提出PDSSNet网络，包含三个模块：APEM（提取无偏类原型）、SSCM（语义-结构协同）和CSAM（动态调整类间特征）。

Result: 实验表明PDSSNet性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PDSSNet通过语义与结构的协同，显著提升了遥感图像分割的完整性和准确性。

Abstract: In the semantic segmentation of remote sensing images, acquiring complete
ground objects is critical for achieving precise analysis. However, this task
is severely hindered by two major challenges: high intra-class variance and
high inter-class similarity. Traditional methods often yield incomplete
segmentation results due to their inability to effectively unify class
representations and distinguish between similar features. Even emerging
class-guided approaches are limited by coarse class prototype representations
and a neglect of target structural information.
  Therefore, this paper proposes a Prototype-Driven Structure Synergy Network
(PDSSNet). The design of this network is based on a core concept, a complete
ground object is jointly defined by its invariant class semantics and its
variant spatial structure. To implement this, we have designed three key
modules. First, the Adaptive Prototype Extraction Module (APEM) ensures
semantic accuracy from the source by encoding the ground truth to extract
unbiased class prototypes. Subsequently, the designed Semantic-Structure
Coordination Module (SSCM) follows a hierarchical semantics-first,
structure-second principle. This involves first establishing a global semantic
cognition, then leveraging structural information to constrain and refine the
semantic representation, thereby ensuring the integrity of class information.
Finally, the Channel Similarity Adjustment Module (CSAM) employs a dynamic
step-size adjustment mechanism to focus on discriminative features between
classes.
  Extensive experiments demonstrate that PDSSNet outperforms state-of-the-art
methods. The source code is available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种双提示学习框架DCAR，通过联合优化属性和类别特征，提升图像-文本检索任务中CLIP模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提示学习在图像分类任务中表现优异，但在图像-文本检索任务中面临挑战，尤其是区分细粒度属性和相似子类别。

Method: DCAR框架动态调整语义和视觉维度的提示向量，联合优化属性和类别特征。属性级别基于文本-图像互信息更新权重，类别级别引入多视角负样本和类别匹配权重。

Result: 在构建的FDRD数据集上，DCAR超越了现有基线，实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: DCAR通过双提示学习和联合优化策略，有效解决了图像-文本检索任务中的细粒度区分问题。

Abstract: Recently, prompt learning has demonstrated remarkable success in adapting
pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to various downstream tasks such as
image classification. However, its application to the downstream Image-Text
Retrieval (ITR) task is more challenging. We find that the challenge lies in
discriminating both fine-grained attributes and similar subcategories of the
downstream data. To address this challenge, we propose Dual prompt Learning
with Joint Category-Attribute Reweighting (DCAR), a novel dual-prompt learning
framework to achieve precise image-text matching. The framework dynamically
adjusts prompt vectors from both semantic and visual dimensions to improve the
performance of CLIP on the downstream ITR task. Based on the prompt paradigm,
DCAR jointly optimizes attribute and class features to enhance fine-grained
representation learning. Specifically, (1) at the attribute level, it
dynamically updates the weights of attribute descriptions based on text-image
mutual information correlation; (2) at the category level, it introduces
negative samples from multiple perspectives with category-matching weighting to
learn subcategory distinctions. To validate our method, we construct the
Fine-class Described Retrieval Dataset (FDRD), which serves as a challenging
benchmark for ITR in downstream data domains. It covers over 1,500 downstream
fine categories and 230,000 image-caption pairs with detailed attribute
annotations. Extensive experiments on FDRD demonstrate that DCAR achieves
state-of-the-art performance over existing baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市环境中路边停车导致的非视距（NLoS）盲区对道路安全构成威胁，尤其是行人突然出现的情况。现有方法依赖预定义空间信息或简单反射假设，难以应对动态变化的停车场景。

Method: 通过图像分割检测停车车辆，利用深度估计推断空间特征，再结合2D雷达点云数据精确定位行人。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在真实城市道路环境中有效提升了行人早期检测能力。

Conclusion: 提出的框架通过融合视觉和雷达数据，解决了动态停车场景下的NLoS行人定位问题，为道路安全提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: The presence of Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) blind spots resulting from roadside
parking in urban environments poses a significant challenge to road safety,
particularly due to the sudden emergence of pedestrians. mmWave technology
leverages diffraction and reflection to observe NLoS regions, and recent
studies have demonstrated its potential for detecting obscured objects.
However, existing approaches predominantly rely on predefined spatial
information or assume simple wall reflections, thereby limiting their
generalizability and practical applicability. A particular challenge arises in
scenarios where pedestrians suddenly appear from between parked vehicles, as
these parked vehicles act as temporary spatial obstructions. Furthermore, since
parked vehicles are dynamic and may relocate over time, spatial information
obtained from satellite maps or other predefined sources may not accurately
reflect real-time road conditions, leading to erroneous sensor interpretations.
To address this limitation, we propose an NLoS pedestrian localization
framework that integrates monocular camera image with 2D radar point cloud
(PCD) data. The proposed method initially detects parked vehicles through image
segmentation, estimates depth to infer approximate spatial characteristics, and
subsequently refines this information using 2D radar PCD to achieve precise
spatial inference. Experimental evaluations conducted in real-world urban road
environments demonstrate that the proposed approach enhances early pedestrian
detection and contributes to improved road safety. Supplementary materials are

Conclusion: CORE-ReID V2为UDA重识别提供了高效解决方案，并推动进一步研究。

Abstract: This study presents CORE-ReID V2, an enhanced framework building upon
CORE-ReID. The new framework extends its predecessor by addressing Unsupervised
Domain Adaptation (UDA) challenges in Person ReID and Vehicle ReID, with
further applicability to Object ReID. During pre-training, CycleGAN is employed
to synthesize diverse data, bridging image characteristic gaps across different
domains. In the fine-tuning, an advanced ensemble fusion mechanism, consisting
of the Efficient Channel Attention Block (ECAB) and the Simplified Efficient
Channel Attention Block (SECAB), enhances both local and global feature
representations while reducing ambiguity in pseudo-labels for target samples.
Experimental results on widely used UDA Person ReID and Vehicle ReID datasets
demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods,
achieving top performance in Mean Average Precision (mAP) and Rank-k Accuracy
(Top-1, Top-5, Top-10). Moreover, the framework supports lightweight backbones
such as ResNet18 and ResNet34, ensuring both scalability and efficiency. Our
work not only pushes the boundaries of UDA-based Object ReID but also provides
a solid foundation for further research and advancements in this domain. Our

TL;DR: 提出了一种高效的自挖掘先验引导联合频率增强网络（SPJFNet），解决了现有暗图像恢复方法在计算负担、冗余操作和频率处理上的效率瓶颈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有暗图像恢复方法存在效率问题，包括依赖外部先验、多阶段增强管道的冗余操作以及频率域方法的全局计算需求。

Method: 引入自挖掘引导模块（SMGM）生成轻量级内源性引导，通过无损小波分解和联合傅里叶增强优化频率处理，提出双频率引导框架（DFGF）分离高低频处理。

Result: SPJFNet在多个基准测试中超越现有方法，显著降低了模型复杂度和计算开销。

Conclusion: SPJFNet通过自挖掘先验和高效频率处理，实现了高性能和高效能的暗图像恢复。

Abstract: Current dark image restoration methods suffer from severe efficiency
bottlenecks, primarily stemming from: (1) computational burden and error
correction costs associated with reliance on external priors (manual or
cross-modal); (2) redundant operations in complex multi-stage enhancement
pipelines; and (3) indiscriminate processing across frequency components in
frequency-domain methods, leading to excessive global computational demands. To
address these challenges, we propose an Efficient Self-Mining Prior-Guided
Joint Frequency Enhancement Network (SPJFNet). Specifically, we first introduce
a Self-Mining Guidance Module (SMGM) that generates lightweight endogenous
guidance directly from the network, eliminating dependence on external priors
and thereby bypassing error correction overhead while improving inference
speed. Second, through meticulous analysis of different frequency domain
characteristics, we reconstruct and compress multi-level operation chains into
a single efficient operation via lossless wavelet decomposition and joint
Fourier-based advantageous frequency enhancement, significantly reducing
parameters. Building upon this foundation, we propose a Dual-Frequency Guidance
Framework (DFGF) that strategically deploys specialized high/low frequency
branches (wavelet-domain high-frequency enhancement and Fourier-domain
low-frequency restoration), decoupling frequency processing to substantially
reduce computational complexity. Rigorous evaluation across multiple benchmarks
demonstrates that SPJFNet not only surpasses state-of-the-art performance but
also achieves significant efficiency improvements, substantially reducing model
complexity and computational overhead. Code is available at

Result: 评估显示现有视觉语言模型在静态空间任务表现良好，但在动态多步推理场景中存在明显不足。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了时间建模和因果推理的基本弱点，为未来开发更强大、通用的VTR系统提供了方向。

Abstract: Visual transformation reasoning (VTR) is a vital cognitive capability that
empowers intelligent agents to understand dynamic scenes, model causal
relationships, and predict future states, and thereby guiding actions and
laying the foundation for advanced intelligent systems. However, existing
benchmarks suffer from a sim-to-real gap, limited task complexity, and
incomplete reasoning coverage, limiting their practical use in real-world
scenarios. To address these limitations, we introduce VisualTrans, the first
comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for VTR in real-world
human-object interaction scenarios. VisualTrans encompasses 12 semantically
diverse manipulation tasks and systematically evaluates three essential
reasoning dimensions - spatial, procedural, and quantitative - through 6
well-defined subtask types. The benchmark features 472 high-quality
question-answer pairs in various formats, including multiple-choice, open-ended
counting, and target enumeration. We introduce a scalable data construction
pipeline built upon first-person manipulation videos, which integrates task
selection, image pair extraction, automated metadata annotation with large
multimodal models, and structured question generation. Human verification
ensures the final benchmark is both high-quality and interpretable. Evaluations
of various state-of-the-art vision-language models show strong performance in
static spatial tasks. However, they reveal notable shortcomings in dynamic,
multi-step reasoning scenarios, particularly in areas like intermediate state
recognition and transformation sequence planning. These findings highlight
fundamental weaknesses in temporal modeling and causal reasoning, providing
clear directions for future research aimed at developing more capable and
generalizable VTR systems. The dataset and code are available at

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has attracted considerable attention in
medical image processing. The latest SSL methods use a combination of
consistency regularization and pseudo-labeling to achieve remarkable success.
However, most existing SSL studies focus on segmenting large organs, neglecting
the challenging scenarios where there are numerous tumors or tumors of small
volume. Furthermore, the extensive capabilities of data augmentation
strategies, particularly in the context of both labeled and unlabeled data,
have yet to be thoroughly investigated. To tackle these challenges, we
introduce a straightforward yet effective approach, termed iterative
pseudo-labeling based adaptive copy-paste supervision (IPA-CP), for tumor
segmentation in CT scans. IPA-CP incorporates a two-way uncertainty based
adaptive augmentation mechanism, aiming to inject tumor uncertainties present
in the mean teacher architecture into adaptive augmentation. Additionally,
IPA-CP employs an iterative pseudo-label transition strategy to generate more
robust and informative pseudo labels for the unlabeled samples. Extensive
experiments on both in-house and public datasets show that our framework
outperforms state-of-the-art SSL methods in medical image segmentation.
Ablation study results demonstrate the effectiveness of our technical
contributions.

Conclusion: 该方法为手语视频生成提供了一种高效且灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Sign language video generation requires producing natural signing motions
with realistic appearances under precise semantic control, yet faces two
critical challenges: excessive signer-specific data requirements and poor
generalization. We propose a new paradigm for sign language video generation
that decouples motion semantics from signer identity through a two-phase
synthesis framework. First, we construct a signer-independent multimodal motion
lexicon, where each gloss is stored as identity-agnostic pose, gesture, and 3D
mesh sequences, requiring only one recording per sign. This compact
representation enables our second key innovation: a discrete-to-continuous
motion synthesis stage that transforms retrieved gloss sequences into
temporally coherent motion trajectories, followed by identity-aware neural
rendering to produce photorealistic videos of arbitrary signers. Unlike prior
work constrained by signer-specific datasets, our method treats motion as a
first-class citizen: the learned latent pose dynamics serve as a portable
"choreography layer" that can be visually realized through different human
appearances. Extensive experiments demonstrate that disentangling motion from
identity is not just viable but advantageous - enabling both high-quality
synthesis and unprecedented flexibility in signer personalization.

Motivation: 跨视角对象对应是视觉理解中的关键但具有挑战性的任务。

Method: 提出DOMR框架，包含密集对象匹配模块（DOM）和掩码细化头，联合建模对象间关系。

Result: 在Ego-Exo4D基准测试中，平均IoU为49.7%（Ego→Exo）和55.2%（Exo→Ego），分别提升5.8%和4.3%。

Conclusion: DOMR框架通过联合建模对象间关系，显著提升了跨视角对象对应的性能。

Abstract: Cross-view object correspondence involves matching objects between egocentric
(first-person) and exocentric (third-person) views. It is a critical yet
challenging task for visual understanding. In this work, we propose the Dense
Object Matching and Refinement (DOMR) framework to establish dense object
correspondences across views. The framework centers around the Dense Object
Matcher (DOM) module, which jointly models multiple objects. Unlike methods
that directly match individual object masks to image features, DOM leverages
both positional and semantic relationships among objects to find
correspondences. DOM integrates a proposal generation module with a dense
matching module that jointly encodes visual, spatial, and semantic cues,
explicitly constructing inter-object relationships to achieve dense matching
among objects. Furthermore, we combine DOM with a mask refinement head designed
to improve the completeness and accuracy of the predicted masks, forming the
complete DOMR framework. Extensive evaluations on the Ego-Exo4D benchmark
demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance with a mean
IoU of 49.7% on Ego$\to$Exo and 55.2% on Exo$\to$Ego. These results outperform
those of previous methods by 5.8% and 4.3%, respectively, validating the
effectiveness of our integrated approach for cross-view understanding.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于全局可预测插值（GPI）的白盒Transformer框架（GPI-WT），用于k空间数据插值，显著提升了插值精度和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如卷积神经网络）主要利用局部可预测性，忽视了k空间的全局依赖性。Transformer因其捕捉长距离依赖的能力而受到启发，但其缺乏可解释性。

Method: 从湮灭角度提出GPI作为新的k空间结构化低秩模型，将全局湮灭滤波器作为可学习参数，并通过展开SLR模型的优化算法构建白盒Transformer。

Result: 实验表明，GPI-WT在k空间插值精度上显著优于现有方法，同时提供更好的可解释性。

Conclusion: GPI-WT是一种高效且可解释的k空间插值方法，为加速MRI提供了新思路。

Abstract: Interpolating missing data in k-space is essential for accelerating imaging.
However, existing methods, including convolutional neural network-based deep
learning, primarily exploit local predictability while overlooking the inherent
global dependencies in k-space. Recently, Transformers have demonstrated
remarkable success in natural language processing and image analysis due to
their ability to capture long-range dependencies. This inspires the use of
Transformers for k-space interpolation to better exploit its global structure.
However, their lack of interpretability raises concerns regarding the
reliability of interpolated data. To address this limitation, we propose
GPI-WT, a white-box Transformer framework based on Globally Predictable
Interpolation (GPI) for k-space. Specifically, we formulate GPI from the
perspective of annihilation as a novel k-space structured low-rank (SLR) model.
The global annihilation filters in the SLR model are treated as learnable
parameters, and the subgradients of the SLR model naturally induce a learnable
attention mechanism. By unfolding the subgradient-based optimization algorithm
of SLR into a cascaded network, we construct the first white-box Transformer
specifically designed for accelerated MRI. Experimental results demonstrate
that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches
in k-space interpolation accuracy while providing superior interpretability.

Conclusion: Uni-DocDiff为文档修复提供了一种高效、可扩展的统一解决方案，显著提升了多任务协同能力。

Abstract: Removing various degradations from damaged documents greatly benefits
digitization, downstream document analysis, and readability. Previous methods
often treat each restoration task independently with dedicated models, leading
to a cumbersome and highly complex document processing system. Although recent
studies attempt to unify multiple tasks, they often suffer from limited
scalability due to handcrafted prompts and heavy preprocessing, and fail to
fully exploit inter-task synergy within a shared architecture. To address the
aforementioned challenges, we propose Uni-DocDiff, a Unified and highly
scalable Document restoration model based on Diffusion. Uni-DocDiff develops a
learnable task prompt design, ensuring exceptional scalability across diverse
tasks. To further enhance its multi-task capabilities and address potential
task interference, we devise a novel \textbf{Prior \textbf{P}ool}, a simple yet
comprehensive mechanism that combines both local high-frequency features and
global low-frequency features. Additionally, we design the \textbf{Prior
\textbf{F}usion \textbf{M}odule (PFM)}, which enables the model to adaptively
select the most relevant prior information for each specific task. Extensive
experiments show that the versatile Uni-DocDiff achieves performance comparable
or even superior performance compared with task-specific expert models, and
simultaneously holds the task scalability for seamless adaptation to new tasks.

Motivation: 传统Transformer在医学图像分割中存在计算复杂度高和局部上下文信息捕捉不足的问题。

Conclusion: TCSAFormer在效率和准确性之间取得了最佳平衡，适用于医学图像分割任务。

Abstract: In recent years, transformer-based methods have achieved remarkable progress
in medical image segmentation due to their superior ability to capture
long-range dependencies. However, these methods typically suffer from two major
limitations. First, their computational complexity scales quadratically with
the input sequences. Second, the feed-forward network (FFN) modules in vanilla
Transformers typically rely on fully connected layers, which limits models'
ability to capture local contextual information and multiscale features
critical for precise semantic segmentation. To address these issues, we propose
an efficient medical image segmentation network, named TCSAFormer. The proposed
TCSAFormer adopts two key ideas. First, it incorporates a Compressed Attention
(CA) module, which combines token compression and pixel-level sparse attention
to dynamically focus on the most relevant key-value pairs for each query. This
is achieved by pruning globally irrelevant tokens and merging redundant ones,
significantly reducing computational complexity while enhancing the model's
ability to capture relationships between tokens. Second, it introduces a
Dual-Branch Feed-Forward Network (DBFFN) module as a replacement for the
standard FFN to capture local contextual features and multiscale information,
thereby strengthening the model's feature representation capability. We conduct
extensive experiments on three publicly available medical image segmentation
datasets: ISIC-2018, CVC-ClinicDB, and Synapse, to evaluate the segmentation
performance of TCSAFormer. Experimental results demonstrate that TCSAFormer
achieves superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art (SOTA)
methods, while maintaining lower computational overhead, thus achieving an
optimal trade-off between efficiency and accuracy.

Motivation: 遮挡感知是空间理解的关键，但当前MLLMs在此领域的表现尚未充分探索，因此需要专门的评估工具。

Method: 基于SA-1B构建1,365张语义连贯的遮挡图像，标注4,588个问答对，评估22种MLLMs。

Result: MLLMs与人类表现差距显著，模型规模或思考过程无法完全弥补；识别出三种失败模式。

Conclusion: O-Bench为遮挡感知提供了重要评估工具，并启发MLLMs在视觉智能上的进一步发展。

Abstract: Occlusion perception, a critical foundation for human-level spatial
understanding, embodies the challenge of integrating visual recognition and
reasoning. Though multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities, their performance on occlusion perception remains
under-explored. To address this gap, we introduce O-Bench, the first visual
question answering (VQA) benchmark specifically designed for occlusion
perception. Based on SA-1B, we construct 1,365 images featuring semantically
coherent occlusion scenarios through a novel layered synthesis approach. Upon
this foundation, we annotate 4,588 question-answer pairs in total across five
tailored tasks, employing a reliable, semi-automatic workflow. Our extensive
evaluation of 22 representative MLLMs against the human baseline reveals a
significant performance gap between current MLLMs and humans, which, we find,
cannot be sufficiently bridged by model scaling or thinking process. We further
identify three typical failure patterns, including an overly conservative bias,
a fragile gestalt prediction, and a struggle with quantitative tasks. We
believe O-Bench can not only provide a vital evaluation tool for occlusion
perception, but also inspire the development of MLLMs for better visual
intelligence. Our benchmark will be made publicly available upon paper
publication.

often incorporating modules such as Transformers or Mamba to enhance
global-local feature interactions within decoder stages. However, these
enhancements typically focus on intra-scale relationships and neglect the
global contextual dependencies across multiple resolutions. To address this
limitation, we introduce the Terrace Convolutional Decoder Network (TNet), a
simple yet effective architecture that leverages only convolution and addition
operations to progressively integrate low-resolution features (rich in global
context) into higher-resolution features (rich in local details) across
decoding stages. This progressive fusion enables the model to learn
spatially-aware convolutional kernels that naturally blend global and local
information in a stage-wise manner. We implement TNet with a ResNet-18 encoder
(TNet-R) and evaluate it on three benchmark datasets. TNet-R achieves
competitive performance with a mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) of 85.35\%
on ISPRS Vaihingen, 87.05\% on ISPRS Potsdam, and 52.19\% on LoveDA, while
maintaining high computational efficiency. Code is publicly available.

TL;DR: 3DSR是一种基于3D高斯溅射的超分辨率框架，利用现成的2D扩散超分辨率模型，确保3D一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如图像上采样或视频超分辨率）未明确考虑3D一致性，3DSR旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 使用3D高斯溅射表示场景，结合2D扩散模型，无需额外微调。

Result: 在MipNeRF360和LLFF数据上验证，生成高分辨率且视觉吸引人的结果，保持3D结构一致性。

Conclusion: 3DSR在提升视觉质量的同时，确保了3D重建的空间一致性，代码将开源。

Abstract: We propose 3D Super Resolution (3DSR), a novel 3D Gaussian-splatting-based
super-resolution framework that leverages off-the-shelf diffusion-based 2D
super-resolution models. 3DSR encourages 3D consistency across views via the
use of an explicit 3D Gaussian-splatting-based scene representation. This makes
the proposed 3DSR different from prior work, such as image upsampling or the
use of video super-resolution, which either don't consider 3D consistency or
aim to incorporate 3D consistency implicitly. Notably, our method enhances
visual quality without additional fine-tuning, ensuring spatial coherence
within the reconstructed scene. We evaluate 3DSR on MipNeRF360 and LLFF data,
demonstrating that it produces high-resolution results that are visually
compelling, while maintaining structural consistency in 3D reconstructions.
Code will be released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏视图条件下实现精确几何重建是当前挑战，现有方法在深度正则化和边缘保留方面存在不足。

Method: DET-GS采用分层几何深度监督框架和边缘感知深度正则化，结合RGB引导的边缘保留总变差损失。

Result: 实验表明，DET-GS在几何精度和视觉保真度上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DET-GS为稀疏视图合成提供了高效且高保真的解决方案。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) represents a significant advancement in the
field of efficient and high-fidelity novel view synthesis. Despite recent
progress, achieving accurate geometric reconstruction under sparse-view
conditions remains a fundamental challenge. Existing methods often rely on
non-local depth regularization, which fails to capture fine-grained structures
and is highly sensitive to depth estimation noise. Furthermore, traditional
smoothing methods neglect semantic boundaries and indiscriminately degrade
essential edges and textures, consequently limiting the overall quality of
reconstruction. In this work, we propose DET-GS, a unified depth and edge-aware
regularization framework for 3D Gaussian Splatting. DET-GS introduces a
hierarchical geometric depth supervision framework that adaptively enforces
multi-level geometric consistency, significantly enhancing structural fidelity
and robustness against depth estimation noise. To preserve scene boundaries, we
design an edge-aware depth regularization guided by semantic masks derived from
Canny edge detection. Furthermore, we introduce an RGB-guided edge-preserving
Total Variation loss that selectively smooths homogeneous regions while
rigorously retaining high-frequency details and textures. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that DET-GS achieves substantial improvements in both geometric
accuracy and visual fidelity, outperforming state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on
sparse-view novel view synthesis benchmarks.

<details>

Motivation: 医学图像分析中标注数据有限，现有VLM直接应用于医学领域存在域差距问题，且单模态方法易导致模态不对齐。

Method: 提出NEARL-CLIP框架，包含USEformer（动态生成跨模态查询）和OCA（正交技术分离新知识），参数高效（仅1.46M）。

Result: NEARL-CLIP通过跨模态交互和正交技术，显著提升了医学图像分析的性能。

Conclusion: NEARL-CLIP有效解决了医学图像分析中的域差距和模态不对齐问题，为VLM在医学领域的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Computer-aided medical image analysis is crucial for disease diagnosis and
treatment planning, yet limited annotated datasets restrict medical-specific
model development. While vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP offer strong
generalization capabilities, their direct application to medical imaging
analysis is impeded by a significant domain gap. Existing approaches to bridge
this gap, including prompt learning and one-way modality interaction
techniques, typically focus on introducing domain knowledge to a single
modality. Although this may offer performance gains, it often causes modality
misalignment, thereby failing to unlock the full potential of VLMs. In this
paper, we propose \textbf{NEARL-CLIP} (i\underline{N}teracted qu\underline{E}ry
\underline{A}daptation with o\underline{R}thogona\underline{L} Regularization),
a novel cross-modality interaction VLM-based framework that contains two
contributions: (1) Unified Synergy Embedding Transformer (USEformer), which
dynamically generates cross-modality queries to promote interaction between
modalities, thus fostering the mutual enrichment and enhancement of multi-modal
medical domain knowledge; (2) Orthogonal Cross-Attention Adapter (OCA). OCA
introduces an orthogonality technique to decouple the new knowledge from
USEformer into two distinct components: the truly novel information and the
incremental knowledge. By isolating the learning process from the interference
of incremental knowledge, OCA enables a more focused acquisition of new
information, thereby further facilitating modality interaction and unleashing
the capability of VLMs. Notably, NEARL-CLIP achieves these two contributions in
a parameter-efficient style, which only introduces \textbf{1.46M} learnable
parameters.

Abstract: Human perception studies can provide complementary insights to qualitative
evaluation for understanding computer vision (CV) model performance. However,
conducting human perception studies remains a non-trivial task, it often
requires complex, end-to-end system setups that are time-consuming and
difficult to scale. In this paper, we explore the unique opportunity presented
by augmented reality (AR) for helping CV researchers to conduct perceptual
studies. We design ARCADE, an evaluation platform that allows researchers to
easily leverage AR's rich context and interactivity for human-centered CV
evaluation. Specifically, ARCADE supports cross-platform AR data collection,
custom experiment protocols via pluggable model inference, and AR streaming for
user studies. We demonstrate ARCADE using two types of CV models, depth and
lighting estimation and show that AR tasks can be effectively used to elicit
human perceptual judgments of model quality. We also evaluate the systems
usability and performance across different deployment and study settings,
highlighting its flexibility and effectiveness as a human-centered evaluation
platform.

TL;DR: MLLMSeg是一个新颖的框架，利用MLLM视觉编码器的视觉细节特征，无需额外视觉编码器，通过DSFF模块融合细节和语义特征，轻量级掩码解码器实现精确分割，性能优于现有方法。


<details>

Motivation: 解决MLLMs在像素级密集预测上的不足，避免使用参数繁重的SAM或牺牲精度的轻量级方法，平衡性能与成本。

Method: 提出MLLMSeg框架，利用MLLM视觉编码器的细节特征；设计DSFF模块融合细节和语义特征；轻量级掩码解码器（34M参数）实现精确预测。

Result: 实验表明，MLLMSeg在性能上超越SAM-based和SAM-free方法，平衡了性能与成本。

Conclusion: MLLMSeg通过充分利用MLLM的视觉细节特征和轻量级设计，实现了高效且精确的参考表达分割。

Abstract: Reference Expression Segmentation (RES) aims to segment image regions
specified by referring expressions and has become popular with the rise of
multimodal large models (MLLMs). While MLLMs excel in semantic understanding,
their token-generation paradigm struggles with pixel-level dense prediction.
Existing RES methods either couple MLLMs with the parameter-heavy Segment
Anything Model (SAM) with 632M network parameters or adopt SAM-free lightweight
pipelines that sacrifice accuracy. To address the trade-off between performance
and cost, we specifically propose MLLMSeg, a novel framework that fully
exploits the inherent visual detail features encoded in the MLLM vision encoder
without introducing an extra visual encoder. Besides, we propose a
detail-enhanced and semantic-consistent feature fusion module (DSFF) that fully
integrates the detail-related visual feature with the semantic-related feature
output by the large language model (LLM) of MLLM. Finally, we establish a
light-weight mask decoder with only 34M network parameters that optimally
leverages detailed spatial features from the visual encoder and semantic
features from the LLM to achieve precise mask prediction. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method generally surpasses both SAM-based and SAM-free
competitors, striking a better balance between performance and cost. Code is

Result: 实验表明，该方法在车辆重识别和行人搜索任务中均优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: CLIPVehicle通过联合学习和新数据集，显著提升了车辆搜索的效率和性能。

Abstract: Vehicles, as one of the most common and significant objects in the real
world, the researches on which using computer vision technologies have made
remarkable progress, such as vehicle detection, vehicle re-identification, etc.
To search an interested vehicle from the surveillance videos, existing methods
first pre-detect and store all vehicle patches, and then apply vehicle
re-identification models, which is resource-intensive and not very practical.
In this work, we aim to achieve the joint detection and re-identification for
vehicle search. However, the conflicting objectives between detection that
focuses on shared vehicle commonness and re-identification that focuses on
individual vehicle uniqueness make it challenging for a model to learn in an
end-to-end system. For this problem, we propose a new unified framework, namely
CLIPVehicle, which contains a dual-granularity semantic-region alignment module
to leverage the VLMs (Vision-Language Models) for vehicle discrimination
modeling, and a multi-level vehicle identification learning strategy to learn
the identity representation from global, instance and feature levels. We also
construct a new benchmark, including a real-world dataset CityFlowVS, and two
synthetic datasets SynVS-Day and SynVS-All, for vehicle search. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods of both vehicle Re-ID and person search tasks.

Conclusion: 扩散模型在实例分割任务中具有潜力，OC-DiT展示了其有效性。

Abstract: This paper presents OC-DiT, a novel class of diffusion models designed for
object-centric prediction, and applies it to zero-shot instance segmentation.
We propose a conditional latent diffusion framework that generates instance
masks by conditioning the generative process on object templates and image
features within the diffusion model's latent space. This allows our model to
effectively disentangle object instances through the diffusion process, which
is guided by visual object descriptors and localized image cues. Specifically,
we introduce two model variants: a coarse model for generating initial object
instance proposals, and a refinement model that refines all proposals in
parallel. We train these models on a newly created, large-scale synthetic
dataset comprising thousands of high-quality object meshes. Remarkably, our
model achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple challenging real-world
benchmarks, without requiring any retraining on target data. Through
comprehensive ablation studies, we demonstrate the potential of diffusion
models for instance segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: 单尺度特征提取在水下图像增强中具有潜力，SSD-Net的创新设计为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Underwater image enhancement (UIE) techniques aim to improve visual quality
of images captured in aquatic environments by addressing degradation issues
caused by light absorption and scattering effects, including color distortion,
blurring, and low contrast. Current mainstream solutions predominantly employ
multi-scale feature extraction (MSFE) mechanisms to enhance reconstruction
quality through multi-resolution feature fusion. However, our extensive
experiments demonstrate that high-quality image reconstruction does not
necessarily rely on multi-scale feature fusion. Contrary to popular belief, our
experiments show that single-scale feature extraction alone can match or
surpass the performance of multi-scale methods, significantly reducing
complexity. To comprehensively explore single-scale feature potential in
underwater enhancement, we propose an innovative Single-Scale Decomposition
Network (SSD-Net). This architecture introduces an asymmetrical decomposition
mechanism that disentangles input image into clean layer along with degradation
layer. The former contains scene-intrinsic information and the latter encodes
medium-induced interference. It uniquely combines CNN's local feature
extraction capabilities with Transformer's global modeling strengths through
two core modules: 1) Parallel Feature Decomposition Block (PFDB), implementing
dual-branch feature space decoupling via efficient attention operations and
adaptive sparse transformer; 2) Bidirectional Feature Communication Block
(BFCB), enabling cross-layer residual interactions for complementary feature
mining and fusion. This synergistic design preserves feature decomposition
independence while establishing dynamic cross-layer information pathways,
effectively enhancing degradation decoupling capacity.

Abstract: As litter pollution continues to rise globally, developing automated tools
capable of detecting litter effectively remains a significant challenge. This
study presents a novel approach that combines, for the first time, privileged
information with deep learning object detection to improve litter detection
while maintaining model efficiency. We evaluate our method across five widely
used object detection models, addressing challenges such as detecting small
litter and objects partially obscured by grass or stones. In addition to this,
a key contribution of our work can also be attributed to formulating a means of
encoding bounding box information as a binary mask, which can be fed to the
detection model to refine detection guidance. Through experiments on both
within-dataset evaluation on the renowned SODA dataset and cross-dataset
evaluation on the BDW and UAVVaste litter detection datasets, we demonstrate
consistent performance improvements across all models. Our approach not only
bolsters detection accuracy within the training sets but also generalises well
to other litter detection contexts. Crucially, these improvements are achieved
without increasing model complexity or adding extra layers, ensuring
computational efficiency and scalability. Our results suggest that this
methodology offers a practical solution for litter detection, balancing
accuracy and efficiency in real-world applications.

Abstract: Deception detection is a critical task in real-world applications such as
security screening, fraud prevention, and credibility assessment. While deep
learning methods have shown promise in surpassing human-level performance,
their effectiveness often depends on the availability of high-quality and
diverse deception samples. Existing research predominantly focuses on
single-domain scenarios, overlooking the significant performance degradation
caused by domain shifts. To address this gap, we present the SVC 2025
Multimodal Deception Detection Challenge, a new benchmark designed to evaluate
cross-domain generalization in audio-visual deception detection. Participants
are required to develop models that not only perform well within individual
domains but also generalize across multiple heterogeneous datasets. By
leveraging multimodal data, including audio, video, and text, this challenge
encourages the design of models capable of capturing subtle and implicit
deceptive cues. Through this benchmark, we aim to foster the development of
more adaptable, explainable, and practically deployable deception detection
systems, advancing the broader field of multimodal learning. By the conclusion
of the workshop competition, a total of 21 teams had submitted their final
results. https://sites.google.com/view/svc-mm25 for more information.

Conclusion: DS²Net通过多视角深度监督和自适应损失设计，显著提升了医学图像分割的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Deep Supervision Networks exhibit significant efficacy for the medical
imaging community. Nevertheless, existing work merely supervises either the
coarse-grained semantic features or fine-grained detailed features in
isolation, which compromises the fact that these two types of features hold
vital relationships in medical image analysis. We advocate the powers of
complementary feature supervision for medical image segmentation, by proposing
a Detail-Semantic Deep Supervision Network (DS$^2$Net). DS$^2$Net navigates
both low-level detailed and high-level semantic feature supervision through
Detail Enhance Module (DEM) and Semantic Enhance Module (SEM). DEM and SEM
respectively harness low-level and high-level feature maps to create detail and
semantic masks for enhancing feature supervision. This is a novel shift from
single-view deep supervision to multi-view deep supervision. DS$^2$Net is also
equipped with a novel uncertainty-based supervision loss that adaptively
assigns the supervision strength of features within distinct scales based on
their uncertainty, thus circumventing the sub-optimal heuristic design that
typifies previous works. Through extensive experiments on six benchmarks
captured under either colonoscopy, ultrasound and microscope, we demonstrate
that DS$^2$Net consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods for medical
image analysis.

Result: 在12个细粒度视觉分类基准测试中表现优于现有少样本CLIP方法和部分全监督方法。

Conclusion: UniFGVC具有广泛的兼容性和泛化能力，适用于少样本细粒度视觉分类任务。

Abstract: Few-shot fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) aims to leverage limited
data to enable models to discriminate subtly distinct categories. Recent works
mostly finetuned the pre-trained visual language models to achieve performance
gain, yet suffering from overfitting and weak generalization. To deal with
this, we introduce UniFGVC, a universal training-free framework that
reformulates few-shot FGVC as multimodal retrieval. First, we propose the
Category-Discriminative Visual Captioner (CDV-Captioner) to exploit the
open-world knowledge of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to generate a
structured text description that captures the fine-grained attribute features
distinguishing closely related classes. CDV-Captioner uses chain-of-thought
prompting and visually similar reference images to reduce hallucination and
enhance discrimination of generated captions. Using it we can convert each
image into an image-description pair, enabling more comprehensive feature
representation, and construct the multimodal category templates using few-shot
samples for the subsequent retrieval pipeline. Then, off-the-shelf vision and
text encoders embed query and template pairs, and FGVC is accomplished by
retrieving the nearest template in the joint space. UniFGVC ensures broad
compatibility with diverse MLLMs and encoders, offering reliable generalization
and adaptability across few-shot FGVC scenarios. Extensive experiments on 12
FGVC benchmarks demonstrate its consistent superiority over prior few-shot
CLIP-based methods and even several fully-supervised MLLMs-based approaches.

Conclusion: IDC-Net通过联合学习框架实现了高质量的RGB-D序列生成，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: We present IDC-Net (Image-Depth Consistency Network), a novel framework
designed to generate RGB-D video sequences under explicit camera trajectory
control. Unlike approaches that treat RGB and depth generation separately,
IDC-Net jointly synthesizes both RGB images and corresponding depth maps within
a unified geometry-aware diffusion model. The joint learning framework
strengthens spatial and geometric alignment across frames, enabling more
precise camera control in the generated sequences. To support the training of
this camera-conditioned model and ensure high geometric fidelity, we construct
a camera-image-depth consistent dataset with metric-aligned RGB videos, depth
maps, and accurate camera poses, which provides precise geometric supervision
with notably improved inter-frame geometric consistency. Moreover, we introduce
a geometry-aware transformer block that enables fine-grained camera control,
enhancing control over the generated sequences. Extensive experiments show that
IDC-Net achieves improvements over state-of-the-art approaches in both visual
quality and geometric consistency of generated scene sequences. Notably, the
generated RGB-D sequences can be directly feed for downstream 3D Scene
reconstruction tasks without extra post-processing steps, showcasing the
practical benefits of our joint learning framework. See more at

Motivation: 现有 LoRA 融合方法在多任务适应中存在权重冲突和领域遗忘问题，尤其在少样本场景下泛化能力不足。

Method: 通过任务向量算术动态平衡优化方向，利用 Fusion VAE 重构融合 LoRA 以实现多任务生成。

Result: 实验表明 ICM-Fusion 能显著减少多任务损失，并在少样本场景中实现任务增强。

Conclusion: ICM-Fusion 是一种高效的多任务 LoRA 融合方法，适用于多种架构和任务。

Abstract: Enabling multi-task adaptation in pre-trained Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
models is crucial for enhancing their generalization capabilities. Most
existing pre-trained LoRA fusion methods decompose weight matrices, sharing
similar parameters while merging divergent ones. However, this paradigm
inevitably induces inter-weight conflicts and leads to catastrophic domain
forgetting. While incremental learning enables adaptation to multiple tasks, it
struggles to achieve generalization in few-shot scenarios. Consequently, when
the weight data follows a long-tailed distribution, it can lead to forgetting
in the fused weights. To address this issue, we propose In-Context Meta LoRA
Fusion (ICM-Fusion), a novel framework that synergizes meta-learning with
in-context adaptation. The key innovation lies in our task vector arithmetic,
which dynamically balances conflicting optimization directions across domains
through learned manifold projections. ICM-Fusion obtains the optimal task
vector orientation for the fused model in the latent space by adjusting the
orientation of the task vectors. Subsequently, the fused LoRA is reconstructed
by a self-designed Fusion VAE (F-VAE) to realize multi-task LoRA generation. We
have conducted extensive experiments on visual and linguistic tasks, and the
experimental results demonstrate that ICM-Fusion can be adapted to a wide range
of architectural models and applied to various tasks. Compared to the current
pre-trained LoRA fusion method, ICM-Fusion fused LoRA can significantly reduce
the multi-tasking loss and can even achieve task enhancement in few-shot
scenarios.

TL;DR: GAVN是一种通用音频辅助人脸视频修复网络，通过身份和时间互补学习解决多种视频失真问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽视了视觉和音频特征的内在关联，尤其是嘴部区域，且仅关注压缩伪影去除。

Method: GAVN分两阶段：低分辨率空间捕获帧间时间特征粗修复，高分辨率空间结合音频和面部标志提取身份特征细化修复。

Result: GAVN在压缩伪影去除、去模糊和超分辨率任务上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GAVN通过结合音频和视觉特征，实现了高质量的人脸视频修复。

Abstract: Face videos accompanied by audio have become integral to our daily lives,
while they often suffer from complex degradations. Most face video restoration
methods neglect the intrinsic correlations between the visual and audio
features, especially in mouth regions. A few audio-aided face video restoration
methods have been proposed, but they only focus on compression artifact
removal. In this paper, we propose a General Audio-assisted face Video
restoration Network (GAVN) to address various types of streaming video
distortions via identity and temporal complementary learning. Specifically,
GAVN first captures inter-frame temporal features in the low-resolution space
to restore frames coarsely and save computational cost. Then, GAVN extracts
intra-frame identity features in the high-resolution space with the assistance
of audio signals and face landmarks to restore more facial details. Finally,
the reconstruction module integrates temporal features and identity features to
generate high-quality face videos. Experimental results demonstrate that GAVN
outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods on face video compression
artifact removal, deblurring, and super-resolution. Codes will be released upon
publication.

*Subhankar Swain,Naquee Rizwan,Nayandeep Deb,Vishwajeet Singh Solanki,Vishwa Gangadhar S,Animesh Mukherjee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新型数据集和标签生成模块，用于改进社交媒体中有害表情包的检测和内容审核。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体中的表情包常被用于传播有害内容，但数据获取和标注成本高，限制了内容审核系统的发展。

Method: 构建了一个包含6,300个真实世界表情包的数据集，分两阶段标注（毒性分类和细粒度标签），并提出标签生成模块。

Result: 实验表明，加入社会相关标签显著提升了现有视觉语言模型在检测任务中的性能。

Conclusion: 该研究为多模态在线环境中的内容审核提供了新颖且可扩展的基础。

Abstract: The 2025 Global Risks Report identifies state-based armed conflict and
societal polarisation among the most pressing global threats, with social media
playing a central role in amplifying toxic discourse. Memes, as a widely used
mode of online communication, often serve as vehicles for spreading harmful
content. However, limitations in data accessibility and the high cost of
dataset curation hinder the development of robust meme moderation systems. To
address this challenge, in this work, we introduce a first-of-its-kind dataset
of 6,300 real-world meme-based posts annotated in two stages: (i) binary
classification into toxic and normal, and (ii) fine-grained labelling of toxic
memes as hateful, dangerous, or offensive. A key feature of this dataset is
that it is enriched with auxiliary metadata of socially relevant tags,
enhancing the context of each meme. In addition, we propose a tag generation
module that produces socially grounded tags, because most in-the-wild memes
often do not come with tags. Experimental results show that incorporating these
tags substantially enhances the performance of state-of-the-art VLMs detection
tasks. Our contributions offer a novel and scalable foundation for improved
content moderation in multimodal online environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对多模态大语言模型在异常检测中领域适应问题的框架，通过多阶段推理和细粒度奖励机制提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有GRPO方法在训练数据利用和推理过程监督上的不足，提升模型在专业异常检测中的表现。

Method: 引入多阶段审慎推理过程和细粒度奖励机制，结合分类准确性和定位监督。

Result: 在多个工业数据集上验证了性能提升，实现了高精度和高效适应。

Conclusion: 该方法有效弥合了通用MLLM能力与专业异常检测需求之间的差距。

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate remarkable
capabilities across diverse domains, their application to specialized anomaly
detection (AD) remains constrained by domain adaptation challenges. Existing
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) based approaches suffer from two
critical limitations: inadequate training data utilization when models produce
uniform responses, and insufficient supervision over reasoning processes that
encourage immediate binary decisions without deliberative analysis. We propose
a comprehensive framework addressing these limitations through two synergistic
innovations. First, we introduce a multi-stage deliberative reasoning process
that guides models from region identification to focused examination,
generating diverse response patterns essential for GRPO optimization while
enabling structured supervision over analytical workflows. Second, we develop a
fine-grained reward mechanism incorporating classification accuracy and
localization supervision, transforming binary feedback into continuous signals
that distinguish genuine analytical insight from spurious correctness.
Comprehensive evaluation across multiple industrial datasets demonstrates
substantial performance improvements in adapting general vision-language models
to specialized anomaly detection. Our method achieves superior accuracy with
efficient adaptation of existing annotations, effectively bridging the gap
between general-purpose MLLM capabilities and the fine-grained visual
discrimination required for detecting subtle manufacturing defects and
structural irregularities.

*Jin Kuang,Dong Liu,Yukuang Zhang,Shengsheng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: U2CLLIE是一个新型低光图像增强框架，通过不确定性感知和空间-颜色因果建模，解决了现有方法在极端暗光条件下的梯度退化和噪声问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注架构创新，忽略了极端暗光条件下特征表示的内在不确定性，导致模型可靠性和因果推理能力下降。

Method: 框架包含两个关键组件：不确定性感知双域去噪模块（UaD）和分层因果感知框架（LEN、NeCo、AsC），分别用于噪声抑制和空间-颜色一致性建模。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上实现了最先进的性能，表现出强大的泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: U2CLLIE通过结合不确定性感知和因果建模，显著提升了低光图像增强的效果和可靠性。

Abstract: Most existing low-light image enhancement approaches primarily focus on
architectural innovations, while often overlooking the intrinsic uncertainty
within feature representations particularly under extremely dark conditions
where degraded gradient and noise dominance severely impair model reliability
and causal reasoning. To address these issues, we propose U2CLLIE, a novel
framework that integrates uncertainty-aware enhancement and spatial-color
causal correlation modeling. From the perspective of entropy-based uncertainty,
our framework introduces two key components: (1) An Uncertainty-Aware
Dual-domain Denoise (UaD) Module, which leverages Gaussian-Guided Adaptive
Frequency Domain Feature Enhancement (G2AF) to suppress frequency-domain noise
and optimize entropy-driven representations. This module enhances spatial
texture extraction and frequency-domain noise suppression/structure refinement,
effectively mitigating gradient vanishing and noise dominance. (2) A
hierarchical causality-aware framework, where a Luminance Enhancement Network
(LEN) first performs coarse brightness enhancement on dark regions. Then,
during the encoder-decoder phase, two asymmetric causal correlation modeling
modules Neighborhood Correlation State Space (NeCo) and Adaptive Spatial-Color
Calibration (AsC) collaboratively construct hierarchical causal constraints.
These modules reconstruct and reinforce neighborhood structure and color
consistency in the feature space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
U2CLLIE achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmark
datasets, exhibiting robust performance and strong generalization across
various scenes.

Motivation: 理解大规模视觉模型（如ViT-22B）的实际效用，并填补其在图像生成任务中的空白。

Method: 在本地环境中训练ViT-22B，分析其训练不稳定性并进行模型修改，同时提出基于ViT的图像生成架构。

Result: ViT-22B在相同参数规模下性能优于ViT，并成功应用于图像生成任务。

Conclusion: ViT-22B在性能和扩展性上具有潜力，尤其在图像生成任务中表现突出。

Abstract: There have been attempts to create large-scale structures in vision models
similar to LLM, such as ViT-22B. While this research has provided numerous
analyses and insights, our understanding of its practical utility remains
incomplete. Therefore, we examine how this model structure reacts and train in
a local environment. We also highlight the instability in training and make
some model modifications to stabilize it. The ViT-22B model, trained from
scratch, overall outperformed ViT in terms of performance under the same
parameter size. Additionally, we venture into the task of image generation,
which has not been attempted in ViT-22B. We propose an image generation
architecture using ViT and investigate which between ViT and ViT-22B is a more
suitable structure for image generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RPCANet++ 是一个结合 RPCA 可解释性和高效深度架构的稀疏对象分割框架，解决了传统 RPCA 的计算负担和动态适应性不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统 RPCA 模型存在计算负担大、依赖精细调参和动态适应性差的问题，限制了其在实际任务中的应用。

Method: RPCANet++ 将松弛的 RPCA 模型展开为结构化网络，包含背景近似模块（BAM）、对象提取模块（OEM）和图像恢复模块（IRM），并引入记忆增强模块（MAM）和深度对比先验模块（DCPM）优化性能。

Result: 在多种数据集上的实验表明，RPCANet++ 在各种成像场景下实现了最先进的性能，并通过可视化和数值测量提升了可解释性。

Conclusion: RPCANet++ 结合了 RPCA 的理论优势和深度网络的高效性，为可靠且可解释的稀疏对象分割设定了新的基准。

Abstract: Robust principal component analysis (RPCA) decomposes an observation matrix
into low-rank background and sparse object components. This capability has
enabled its application in tasks ranging from image restoration to
segmentation. However, traditional RPCA models suffer from computational
burdens caused by matrix operations, reliance on finely tuned hyperparameters,
and rigid priors that limit adaptability in dynamic scenarios. To solve these
limitations, we propose RPCANet++, a sparse object segmentation framework that
fuses the interpretability of RPCA with efficient deep architectures. Our
approach unfolds a relaxed RPCA model into a structured network comprising a
Background Approximation Module (BAM), an Object Extraction Module (OEM), and
an Image Restoration Module (IRM). To mitigate inter-stage transmission loss in
the BAM, we introduce a Memory-Augmented Module (MAM) to enhance background
feature preservation, while a Deep Contrast Prior Module (DCPM) leverages
saliency cues to expedite object extraction. Extensive experiments on diverse
datasets demonstrate that RPCANet++ achieves state-of-the-art performance under
various imaging scenarios. We further improve interpretability via visual and
numerical low-rankness and sparsity measurements. By combining the theoretical
strengths of RPCA with the efficiency of deep networks, our approach sets a new
baseline for reliable and interpretable sparse object segmentation. Codes are

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了首个生物医学多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的遗忘基准MLLMU-Med，用于评估模型在隐私保护和错误知识移除方面的表现，并发现现有方法效果有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物医学MLLMs的训练数据可能包含隐私信息或错误知识，导致部署后出现隐私泄露或错误输出。完全重新训练成本高昂，因此需要机器遗忘技术。但目前缺乏评估遗忘质量的基准。

Method: 提出了MLLMU-Med基准，通过数据生成流程将合成隐私数据和事实错误整合到训练集中，并设计了遗忘效率评分。评估了五种遗忘方法。

Result: 现有方法在生物医学MLLMs中移除有害知识的效果有限，表明仍需改进。

Conclusion: MLLMU-Med为生物医学MLLMs的安全研究提供了新方向，并揭示了当前技术的不足。

Abstract: The security of biomedical Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has
attracted increasing attention. However, training samples easily contain
private information and incorrect knowledge that are difficult to detect,
potentially leading to privacy leakage or erroneous outputs after deployment.
An intuitive idea is to reprocess the training set to remove unwanted content
and retrain the model from scratch. Yet, this is impractical due to significant
computational costs, especially for large language models. Machine unlearning
has emerged as a solution to this problem, which avoids complete retraining by
selectively removing undesired knowledge derived from harmful samples while
preserving required capabilities on normal cases. However, there exist no
available datasets to evaluate the unlearning quality for security protection
in biomedical MLLMs. To bridge this gap, we propose the first benchmark
Multimodal Large Language Model Unlearning for BioMedicine (MLLMU-Med) built
upon our novel data generation pipeline that effectively integrates synthetic
private data and factual errors into the training set. Our benchmark targets
two key scenarios: 1) Privacy protection, where patient private information is
mistakenly included in the training set, causing models to unintentionally
respond with private data during inference; and 2) Incorrectness removal, where
wrong knowledge derived from unreliable sources is embedded into the dataset,
leading to unsafe model responses. Moreover, we propose a novel Unlearning
Efficiency Score that directly reflects the overall unlearning performance
across different subsets. We evaluate five unlearning approaches on MLLMU-Med
and find that these methods show limited effectiveness in removing harmful
knowledge from biomedical MLLMs, indicating significant room for improvement.
This work establishes a new pathway for further research in this promising
field.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频文本视觉问答方法存在冗余文本实体和隐式关系建模的问题，限制了准确性和效率。

Method: GAT模型包括上下文聚合的实例收集模块和实例聚焦的轨迹追踪模块，分别用于整合文本表示和建立时空关系。

Result: GAT在多个数据集上表现优异，准确率提升3.86%，推理速度比现有方法快十倍。

Conclusion: GAT在视频文本视觉问答任务中表现出高效性和泛化能力，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Video text-based visual question answering (Video TextVQA) aims to answer
questions by explicitly reading and reasoning about the text involved in a
video. Most works in this field follow a frame-level framework which suffers
from redundant text entities and implicit relation modeling, resulting in
limitations in both accuracy and efficiency. In this paper, we rethink the
Video TextVQA task from an instance-oriented perspective and propose a novel
model termed GAT (Gather and Trace). First, to obtain accurate reading result
for each video text instance, a context-aggregated instance gathering module is
designed to integrate the visual appearance, layout characteristics, and
textual contents of the related entities into a unified textual representation.
Then, to capture dynamic evolution of text in the video flow, an
instance-focused trajectory tracing module is utilized to establish
spatio-temporal relationships between instances and infer the final answer.
Extensive experiments on several public Video TextVQA datasets validate the
effectiveness and generalization of our framework. GAT outperforms existing
Video TextVQA methods, video-language pretraining methods, and video large
language models in both accuracy and inference speed. Notably, GAT surpasses
the previous state-of-the-art Video TextVQA methods by 3.86\% in accuracy and
achieves ten times of faster inference speed than video large language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统谱聚类方法存在优化过程不连贯和表示能力有限的问题，需要一种更高效且统一的解决方案。

Method: BootSC通过单一网络端到端学习谱聚类的所有阶段，包括亲和矩阵构建、谱嵌入和k-means聚类，并利用最优传输监督和正交重参数化技术提升性能。

Result: 实验表明，BootSC在聚类性能上达到最优，例如在ImageNet-Dogs数据集上比第二名方法提升了16%的NMI。

Conclusion: BootSC通过端到端学习和新技术显著提升了谱聚类的性能，为相关领域提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Spectral clustering is a leading clustering method. Two of its major
shortcomings are the disjoint optimization process and the limited
representation capacity. To address these issues, we propose a deep spectral
clustering model (named BootSC), which jointly learns all stages of spectral
clustering -- affinity matrix construction, spectral embedding, and $k$-means
clustering -- using a single network in an end-to-end manner. BootSC leverages
effective and efficient optimal-transport-derived supervision to bootstrap the
affinity matrix and the cluster assignment matrix. Moreover, a
semantically-consistent orthogonal re-parameterization technique is introduced
to orthogonalize spectral embeddings, significantly enhancing the
discrimination capability. Experimental results indicate that BootSC achieves
state-of-the-art clustering performance. For example, it accomplishes a notable
16\% NMI improvement over the runner-up method on the challenging ImageNet-Dogs
dataset. Our code is available at https://github.com/spdj2271/BootSC.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在视觉语言模型推理中假阳性问题的高训练成本和泛化能力不足。

Method: 构建基于视觉推理核心维度的子问题模板，通过多轮QA构建有效推理路径，动态分析路径一致性并引入自适应CoT机制。

Result: 在A-OKVQA等数据集上，ViFP提升准确率5.4%，减少假阳性，超越现有最佳方法。

Conclusion: ViFP显著提升视觉语言模型的推理可靠性，并通过VoC指标量化评估。

Abstract: In visual-language model (VLM) reasoning, false positive(FP) reasoning occurs
when a model generates a correct answer but follows an incorrect reasoning
path. Existing methods based on specific multi-step reasoning datasets and
reinforcement learning strategies, leading to high training costs and limited
generalization. In this work, we propose ViFP, a general framework for
enhancing visual reasoning reliability. It improves both answer accuracy and
reasoning soundness by detecting FPs. ViFP tackles the limitations of dataset
dependency and poor generalization by constructing sub-question templates
grounded in the core dimensions of visual reasoning, such as object
localization, characteristic description, and object discovery. ViFP then
builds effective reasoning paths via multi-turn QA to improve reasoning
accuracy. Meanwhile, ViFP dynamically analyzes the consistency of reasoning
path to identify potential FPs, and introduces a targeted chain-of-thought
(CoT) mechanism that adaptively guides both FP and non-FP samples. Thereby
reducing logical errors in the reasoning path while preserving accuracy.
Finally, we introduce a reliability evaluation metric-VoC, which integrates
answer accuracy and the FP rate, providing a quantitative tool to assess
whether a VLM not only answers correctly, but also reasons reliably. Our
experiments on closed-source VLMs show that ViFP consistently improves
performance across three datasets: A-OKVQA, OKVQA, and FVQA. On A-OKVQA, ViFP
improves accuracy by up to 5.4%, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art by
4.3%, and significantly reduces the number of FPs, validating its benefits in
enhancing reasoning reliability.

Motivation: 医学疾病诊断中存在小病灶误诊问题，多模态深度学习虽潜力巨大，但数据维度差异导致特征对齐与融合困难。

Method: 采用特征金字塔结构和3D多尺度卷积注意力模块提取病灶特征，结合多尺度交叉注意力模块解决维度不一致问题。

Result: 在Lung-PET-CT-Dx数据集上测试，诊断准确性显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MMCAF-Net有效解决了多模态数据融合问题，提升了医学诊断的准确性。

Abstract: The diagnosis of medical diseases faces challenges such as the misdiagnosis
of small lesions. Deep learning, particularly multimodal approaches, has shown
great potential in the field of medical disease diagnosis. However, the
differences in dimensionality between medical imaging and electronic health
record data present challenges for effective alignment and fusion. To address
these issues, we propose the Multimodal Multiscale Cross-Attention Fusion
Network (MMCAF-Net). This model employs a feature pyramid structure combined
with an efficient 3D multi-scale convolutional attention module to extract
lesion-specific features from 3D medical images. To further enhance multimodal
data integration, MMCAF-Net incorporates a multi-scale cross-attention module,
which resolves dimensional inconsistencies, enabling more effective feature
fusion. We evaluated MMCAF-Net on the Lung-PET-CT-Dx dataset, and the results
showed a significant improvement in diagnostic accuracy, surpassing current
state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at

Conclusion: 新组件为开放词汇模型性能提升提供关键思路。

Abstract: Standard segmentation setups are unable to deliver models that can recognize
concepts outside the training taxonomy. Open-vocabulary approaches promise to
close this gap through language-image pretraining on billions of image-caption
pairs. Unfortunately, we observe that the promise is not delivered due to
several bottlenecks that have caused the performance to plateau for almost two
years. This paper proposes novel oracle components that identify and decouple
these bottlenecks by taking advantage of the groundtruth information. The
presented validation experiments deliver important empirical findings that
provide a deeper insight into the failures of open-vocabulary models and
suggest prominent approaches to unlock the future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在动态场景重建中常将静态和动态元素混合表示，导致运动泄漏、几何失真和时间闪烁，影响了稳定性和可解释性。

Method: SplitGaussian显式分解场景表示，分离静态和动态组件，仅动态分支随时间变形，避免静态区域运动伪影。

Result: 实验表明，SplitGaussian在渲染质量、几何稳定性和运动分离方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SplitGaussian通过解耦设计提高了时间一致性和重建保真度，同时加速了收敛。

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes from monocular video remains fundamentally
challenging due to the need to jointly infer motion, structure, and appearance
from limited observations. Existing dynamic scene reconstruction methods based
on Gaussian Splatting often entangle static and dynamic elements in a shared
representation, leading to motion leakage, geometric distortions, and temporal
flickering. We identify that the root cause lies in the coupled modeling of
geometry and appearance across time, which hampers both stability and
interpretability. To address this, we propose \textbf{SplitGaussian}, a novel
framework that explicitly decomposes scene representations into static and
dynamic components. By decoupling motion modeling from background geometry and
allowing only the dynamic branch to deform over time, our method prevents
motion artifacts in static regions while supporting view- and time-dependent
appearance refinement. This disentangled design not only enhances temporal
consistency and reconstruction fidelity but also accelerates convergence.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that SplitGaussian outperforms prior
state-of-the-art methods in rendering quality, geometric stability, and motion
separation.

Result: 分析了当前评估协议、数据集和指标，指出需改进基准以更好地评估VLM-CL。

Conclusion: 为终身视觉语言系统的研究提供了全面参考，并提出了未来方向。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance across
diverse multimodal tasks by leveraging large-scale pre-training. However,
enabling them to learn continually from non-stationary data remains a major
challenge, as their cross-modal alignment and generalization capabilities are
particularly vulnerable to catastrophic forgetting. Unlike traditional unimodal
continual learning (CL), VLMs face unique challenges such as cross-modal
feature drift, parameter interference due to shared architectures, and
zero-shot capability erosion. This survey offers the first focused and
systematic review of continual learning for VLMs (VLM-CL). We begin by
identifying the three core failure modes that degrade performance in VLM-CL.
Based on these, we propose a challenge-driven taxonomy that maps solutions to
their target problems: (1) \textit{Multi-Modal Replay Strategies} address
cross-modal drift through explicit or implicit memory mechanisms; (2)
\textit{Cross-Modal Regularization} preserves modality alignment during
updates; and (3) \textit{Parameter-Efficient Adaptation} mitigates parameter
interference with modular or low-rank updates. We further analyze current
evaluation protocols, datasets, and metrics, highlighting the need for better
benchmarks that capture VLM-specific forgetting and compositional
generalization. Finally, we outline open problems and future directions,
including continual pre-training and compositional zero-shot learning. This
survey aims to serve as a comprehensive and diagnostic reference for
researchers developing lifelong vision-language systems. All resources are

TL;DR: LayerT2V提出了一种分层生成视频的方法，解决了多物体运动轨迹控制的挑战，显著提升了生成质量和控制能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有T2V生成方法在多物体运动场景中表现不佳，尤其是轨迹交叉时语义冲突严重。

Method: 通过分层合成背景和前景物体，独立控制每个物体的运动轨迹。

Result: 实验表明，LayerT2V在mIoU和AP50指标上分别比SOTA方法提升了1.4倍和4.5倍。

Conclusion: LayerT2V为复杂多物体视频生成提供了高效解决方案，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Controlling object motion trajectories in Text-to-Video (T2V) generation is a
challenging and relatively under-explored area, particularly in scenarios
involving multiple moving objects. Most community models and datasets in the
T2V domain are designed for single-object motion, limiting the performance of
current generative models in multi-object tasks. Additionally, existing motion
control methods in T2V either lack support for multi-object motion scenes or
experience severe performance degradation when object trajectories intersect,
primarily due to the semantic conflicts in colliding regions. To address these
limitations, we introduce LayerT2V, the first approach for generating video by
compositing background and foreground objects layer by layer. This layered
generation enables flexible integration of multiple independent elements within
a video, positioning each element on a distinct "layer" and thus facilitating
coherent multi-object synthesis while enhancing control over the generation
process. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of LayerT2V in
generating complex multi-object scenarios, showcasing 1.4x and 4.5x
improvements in mIoU and AP50 metrics over state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

Abstract: Predicting pedestrian motion trajectories is critical for path planning and
motion control of autonomous vehicles. However, accurately forecasting crowd
trajectories remains a challenging task due to the inherently multimodal and
uncertain nature of human motion. Recent diffusion-based models have shown
promising results in capturing the stochasticity of pedestrian behavior for
trajectory prediction. However, few diffusion-based approaches explicitly
incorporate the underlying motion intentions of pedestrians, which can limit
the interpretability and precision of prediction models. In this work, we
propose a diffusion-based multimodal trajectory prediction model that
incorporates pedestrians' motion intentions into the prediction framework. The
motion intentions are decomposed into lateral and longitudinal components, and
a pedestrian intention recognition module is introduced to enable the model to
effectively capture these intentions. Furthermore, we adopt an efficient
guidance mechanism that facilitates the generation of interpretable
trajectories. The proposed framework is evaluated on two widely used human
trajectory prediction benchmarks, ETH and UCY, on which it is compared against
state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results demonstrate that our method
achieves competitive performance.

Abstract: As black-box AI-driven decision-making systems become increasingly widespread
in modern document processing workflows, improving their transparency and
reliability has become critical, especially in high-stakes applications where
biases or spurious correlations in decision-making could lead to serious
consequences. One vital component often found in such document processing
workflows is document image classification, which, despite its widespread use,
remains difficult to explain. While some recent works have attempted to explain
the decisions of document image classification models through
feature-importance maps, these maps are often difficult to interpret and fail
to provide insights into the global features learned by the model. In this
paper, we aim to bridge this research gap by introducing generative document
counterfactuals that provide meaningful insights into the model's
decision-making through actionable explanations. In particular, we propose
DocVCE, a novel approach that leverages latent diffusion models in combination
with classifier guidance to first generate plausible in-distribution visual
counterfactual explanations, and then performs hierarchical patch-wise
refinement to search for a refined counterfactual that is closest to the target
factual image. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through a
rigorous qualitative and quantitative assessment on 3 different document
classification datasets -- RVL-CDIP, Tobacco3482, and DocLayNet -- and 3
different models -- ResNet, ConvNeXt, and DiT -- using well-established
evaluation criteria such as validity, closeness, and realism. To the best of
the authors' knowledge, this is the first work to explore generative
counterfactual explanations in document image analysis.

Abstract: We consider the problem in Synthetic Aperture RADAR (SAR) of identifying and
classifying objects located on the ground by means of Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs). Specifically, we adopt a single scattering approximation to
classify the shape of the object using both simulated SAR data and
reconstructed images from this data, and we compare the success of these
approaches. We then identify ice types in real SAR imagery from the satellite
Sentinel-1. In both experiments we achieve a promising high classification
accuracy ($\geq$75\%). Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of CNNs in
using SAR data for both geometric and environmental classification tasks. Our
investigation also explores the effect of SAR data acquisition at different
antenna heights on our ability to classify objects successfully.

Result: PIS3R在大视差场景下表现优异，几何完整性高，适用于下游3D视觉任务。

Conclusion: PIS3R是一种高效的大视差图像拼接解决方案，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Image stitching aim to align two images taken from different viewpoints into
one seamless, wider image. However, when the 3D scene contains depth variations
and the camera baseline is significant, noticeable parallax occurs-meaning the
relative positions of scene elements differ substantially between views. Most
existing stitching methods struggle to handle such images with large parallax
effectively. To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose an image
stitching solution called PIS3R that is robust to very large parallax based on
the novel concept of deep 3D reconstruction. First, we apply visual geometry
grounded transformer to two input images with very large parallax to obtain
both intrinsic and extrinsic parameters, as well as the dense 3D scene
reconstruction. Subsequently, we reproject reconstructed dense point cloud onto
a designated reference view using the recovered camera parameters, achieving
pixel-wise alignment and generating an initial stitched image. Finally, to
further address potential artifacts such as holes or noise in the initial
stitching, we propose a point-conditioned image diffusion module to obtain the
refined result.Compared with existing methods, our solution is very large
parallax tolerant and also provides results that fully preserve the geometric
integrity of all pixels in the 3D photogrammetric context, enabling direct
applicability to downstream 3D vision tasks such as SfM. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed algorithm provides accurate stitching results for
images with very large parallax, and outperforms the existing methods
qualitatively and quantitatively.

Abstract: The study of rodent social behavior has shifted in the last years from

Conclusion: SAV框架解决了车辆部件分割的局限性，并提供了新数据集和开源代码，为未来研究奠定基础。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of autonomous driving, vehicle perception,
particularly detection and segmentation, has placed increasingly higher demands
on algorithmic performance. Pre-trained large segmentation models, especially
Segment Anything Model (SAM), have sparked significant interest and inspired
new research directions in artificial intelligence. However, SAM cannot be
directly applied to the fine-grained task of vehicle part segmentation, as its
text-prompted segmentation functionality is not publicly accessible, and the
mask regions generated by its default mode lack semantic labels, limiting its
utility in structured, category-specific segmentation tasks. To address these
limitations, we propose SAV, a novel framework comprising three core
components: a SAM-based encoder-decoder, a vehicle part knowledge graph, and a
context sample retrieval encoding module. The knowledge graph explicitly models
the spatial and geometric relationships among vehicle parts through a
structured ontology, effectively encoding prior structural knowledge.
Meanwhile, the context retrieval module enhances segmentation by identifying
and leveraging visually similar vehicle instances from training data, providing
rich contextual priors for improved generalization. Furthermore, we introduce a
new large-scale benchmark dataset for vehicle part segmentation, named
VehicleSeg10K, which contains 11,665 high-quality pixel-level annotations
across diverse scenes and viewpoints. We conduct comprehensive experiments on
this dataset and two other datasets, benchmarking multiple representative
baselines to establish a solid foundation for future research and comparison. %
Both the dataset and source code of this paper will be released upon
acceptance. Both the dataset and source code of this paper will be released on

TL;DR: 本文重新评估了直接微调（DFT）在持续语义分割（CSS）中的表现，发现预训练视觉模型（PVMs）具有强大的抗遗忘能力，并提出了一种改进方法DFT*，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究低估了PVMs在CSS中的抗遗忘能力，认为直接微调（DFT）会导致严重遗忘。本文旨在验证这一假设并探索改进方法。

Method: 通过系统实验分析DFT在两个标准数据集（Pascal VOC 2012和ADE20K）上的表现，提出DFT*，包括冻结PVM主干和预分配分类器等策略。

Result: 实验表明，DFT*在性能和效率上优于16种现有CSS方法，且训练参数和时间更少。

Conclusion: PVMs具有强大的抗遗忘能力，DFT*是一种简单高效的CSS方法，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Continual Semantic Segmentation (CSS) seeks to incrementally learn to segment
novel classes while preserving knowledge of previously encountered ones. Recent
advancements in CSS have been largely driven by the adoption of Pre-trained
Vision Models (PVMs) as backbones. Among existing strategies, Direct
Fine-Tuning (DFT), which sequentially fine-tunes the model across classes,
remains the most straightforward approach. Prior work often regards DFT as a
performance lower bound due to its presumed vulnerability to severe
catastrophic forgetting, leading to the development of numerous complex
mitigation techniques. However, we contend that this prevailing assumption is
flawed. In this paper, we systematically revisit forgetting in DFT across two
standard benchmarks, Pascal VOC 2012 and ADE20K, under eight CSS settings using
two representative PVM backbones: ResNet101 and Swin-B. Through a detailed
probing analysis, our findings reveal that existing methods significantly
underestimate the inherent anti-forgetting capabilities of PVMs. Even under
DFT, PVMs retain previously learned knowledge with minimal forgetting. Further
investigation of the feature space indicates that the observed forgetting
primarily arises from the classifier's drift away from the PVM, rather than
from degradation of the backbone representations. Based on this insight, we
propose DFT*, a simple yet effective enhancement to DFT that incorporates
strategies such as freezing the PVM backbone and previously learned
classifiers, as well as pre-allocating future classifiers. Extensive
experiments show that DFT* consistently achieves competitive or superior
performance compared to sixteen state-of-the-art CSS methods, while requiring
substantially fewer trainable parameters and less training time.

Motivation: 点云配准对相似变换、噪声点和不完整几何结构敏感，非均匀尺度和缺陷部分易导致局部最优解。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在效率和实用性上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PKSS-Align是一种高效、鲁棒的点云配准方法，适用于多种复杂场景。

Abstract: Point cloud registration is a classical topic in the field of 3D Vision and
Computer Graphics. Generally, the implementation of registration is typically
sensitive to similarity transformations (translation, scaling, and rotation),
noisy points, and incomplete geometric structures. Especially, the non-uniform
scales and defective parts of point clouds increase probability of struck local
optima in registration task. In this paper, we propose a robust point cloud
registration PKSS-Align that can handle various influences, including
similarity transformations, non-uniform densities, random noisy points, and
defective parts. The proposed method measures shape feature-based similarity
between point clouds on the Pre-Kendall shape space (PKSS),
\textcolor{black}{which is a shape measurement-based scheme and doesn't require
point-to-point or point-to-plane metric.} The employed measurement can be
regarded as the manifold metric that is robust to various representations in
the Euclidean coordinate system. Benefited from the measurement, the
transformation matrix can be directly generated for point clouds with mentioned
influences at the same time. The proposed method does not require data training
and complex feature encoding. Based on a simple parallel acceleration, it can
achieve significant improvement for efficiency and feasibility in practice.
Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms the relevant
state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: We present Multi-Baseline Gaussian Splatting (MuRF), a generalized
feed-forward approach for novel view synthesis that effectively handles diverse
baseline settings, including sparse input views with both small and large
baselines. Specifically, we integrate features from Multi-View Stereo (MVS) and
Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) to enhance feature representations for
generalizable reconstruction. Next, We propose a projection-and-sampling
mechanism for deep depth fusion, which constructs a fine probability volume to
guide the regression of the feature map. Furthermore, We introduce a
reference-view loss to improve geometry and optimization efficiency. We
leverage 3D Gaussian representations to accelerate training and inference time
while enhancing rendering quality. MuRF achieves state-of-the-art performance
across multiple baseline settings and diverse scenarios ranging from simple
objects (DTU) to complex indoor and outdoor scenes (RealEstate10K). We also

Motivation: 现有DETR模型在时序句子定位任务中因缺乏显式监督导致查询角色重叠和冗余预测，需改进。

Result: 在三个公开基准上达到最优性能，消融实验验证了各组件及长度先验的重要性。

Conclusion: LATR通过明确查询角色和利用长度先验，显著提升了时序句子定位任务的性能。

Abstract: Temporal sentence grounding (TSG) is a highly challenging task aiming to
localize the temporal segment within an untrimmed video corresponding to a
given natural language description. Benefiting from the design of learnable
queries, the DETR-based models have achieved substantial advancements in the
TSG task. However, the absence of explicit supervision often causes the learned
queries to overlap in roles, leading to redundant predictions. Therefore, we
propose to improve TSG by making each query fulfill its designated role,
leveraging the length priors of the video-description pairs. In this paper, we
introduce the Length-Aware Transformer (LATR) for TSG, which assigns different
queries to handle predictions based on varying temporal lengths. Specifically,
we divide all queries into three groups, responsible for segments with short,
middle, and long temporal durations, respectively. During training, an
additional length classification task is introduced. Predictions from queries
with mismatched lengths are suppressed, guiding each query to specialize in its
designated function. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our
LATR, achieving state-of-the-art performance on three public benchmarks.
Furthermore, the ablation studies validate the contribution of each component
of our method and the critical role of incorporating length priors into the TSG
task.

Motivation: 解决DAS技术中因异构环境导致的数据分布差异和标注数据不足问题，提升模型的跨领域泛化能力。

Result: 在室内步态识别任务中，VPT-Deep方法达到96.94%的分类准确率，仅微调0.322%的参数，优于传统全微调方法（FFT）0.61%，并减少45%的训练时间。

Conclusion: MAEPD作为一种基础模型，具有通用性、高效性和可扩展性，为DAS信号识别模型的泛化问题提供了新范式。

Abstract: Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) technology finds growing applications
across various domains. However, data distribution disparities due to
heterogeneous sensing environments pose challenges for data-driven artificial
intelligence (AI) models, limiting cross-domain generalization and facing a
shortage of labeled training data. To address these issues, this study proposes
a foundational model for DAS signal recognition based on a Masked Autoencoder,
named MAEPD. The MAEPD model is pretrained on a dataset of 635,860 samples,
encompassing DAS gait spatiotemporal signals, 2D GASF images for perimeter
security, 2D time-frequency images for pipeline leakage, and open-dataset
signals including whale vocalizations and seismic activities, using a
self-supervised mask reconstruction task to capture deep semantic features of
DAS signals. Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) is employed for downstream recognition
tasks. This method freezes the pretrained backbone parameters and fine-tunes
only a small set of learnable visual prompt vectors inserted into the
Transformer encoder layers. Experiments on the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 Super
platform validate MAEPD using indoor gait recognition as a downstream task. The
VPT-Deep approach achieves a classification accuracy of 96.94% with just 0.322%
of parameters fine-tuned, surpassing the traditional Full Fine Tuning (FFT)
method by 0.61% and reducing training time by 45%. The model also exhibits
robust performance in pipeline leakage detection, confirming the generality,
efficiency, and scalability of MAEPD as a foundational model. This approach
offers a novel paradigm for addressing the limited generalization of signal
recognition models in the DAS domain.

Conclusion: TempFlow-GRPO通过时间感知优化显著提升了基于流模型的强化学习效果。

Abstract: Recent flow matching models for text-to-image generation have achieved
remarkable quality, yet their integration with reinforcement learning for human
preference alignment remains suboptimal, hindering fine-grained reward-based
optimization. We observe that the key impediment to effective GRPO training of
flow models is the temporal uniformity assumption in existing approaches:
sparse terminal rewards with uniform credit assignment fail to capture the
varying criticality of decisions across generation timesteps, resulting in
inefficient exploration and suboptimal convergence. To remedy this shortcoming,
we introduce \textbf{TempFlow-GRPO} (Temporal Flow GRPO), a principled GRPO
framework that captures and exploits the temporal structure inherent in
flow-based generation. TempFlow-GRPO introduces two key innovations: (i) a
trajectory branching mechanism that provides process rewards by concentrating
stochasticity at designated branching points, enabling precise credit
assignment without requiring specialized intermediate reward models; and (ii) a
noise-aware weighting scheme that modulates policy optimization according to
the intrinsic exploration potential of each timestep, prioritizing learning
during high-impact early stages while ensuring stable refinement in later
phases. These innovations endow the model with temporally-aware optimization
that respects the underlying generative dynamics, leading to state-of-the-art
performance in human preference alignment and standard text-to-image
benchmarks.

Conclusion: RotatedMVPS在自然光下恢复形状和反射率表现优异。

Abstract: Multiview photometric stereo (MVPS) seeks to recover high-fidelity surface
shapes and reflectances from images captured under varying views and
illuminations. However, existing MVPS methods often require controlled darkroom
settings for varying illuminations or overlook the recovery of reflectances and
illuminations properties, limiting their applicability in natural illumination
scenarios and downstream inverse rendering tasks. In this paper, we propose
RotatedMVPS to solve shape and reflectance recovery under rotated natural
light, achievable with a practical rotation stage. By ensuring light
consistency across different camera and object poses, our method reduces the
unknowns associated with complex environment light. Furthermore, we integrate
data priors from off-the-shelf learning-based single-view photometric stereo
methods into our MVPS framework, significantly enhancing the accuracy of shape
and reflectance recovery. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Conclusion: TSPO通过强化学习有效解决了长视频处理中的稀疏帧采样问题，提升了MLLMs的性能和适应性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
progress in vision-language tasks, yet they still face challenges when
processing long-duration video inputs. The limitation arises from MLLMs'
context limit and training costs, necessitating sparse frame sampling before
feeding videos into MLLMs. Existing video MLLMs adopt training-free uniform
sampling or keyframe search, which may miss critical events or be constrained
by the pre-trained models' event understanding capabilities. Meanwhile,
building a training-based method remains challenging due to the unsupervised
and non-differentiable nature of sparse frame sampling. To address these
problems, we propose Temporal Sampling Policy Optimization (TSPO), advancing
MLLMs' long-form video-language understanding via reinforcement learning.
Specifically, we first propose a trainable event-aware temporal agent, which
captures event-query correlation for performing probabilistic keyframe
selection. Then, we propose the TSPO reinforcement learning paradigm, which
models keyframe selection and language generation as a joint decision-making
process, enabling end-to-end group relative optimization with efficient
rule-based rewards. Furthermore, for the TSPO's training, we propose a long
video training data construction pipeline with comprehensive temporal data and
video Needle-in-a-Haystack data. Finally, we incorporate rule-based answering
accuracy and temporal locating reward mechanisms to optimize the temporal
sampling policy. Comprehensive experiments show that our TSPO achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple long video understanding
benchmarks, and shows transferable ability across different cutting-edge
Video-MLLMs.

Method: 提出VisionTS++，包括高质量时间序列数据筛选、多变量时间序列转换为RGB图像、多分位数预测方法。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，MSE降低6%-44%，在12个概率预测设置中9个排名第一。

Abstract: Recent studies have revealed that vision models pre-trained on images can
perform well in time series forecasting by reformulating forecasting as an
image reconstruction task, suggesting their potential as universal time series
foundation models. However, effective cross-modal transfer from vision to time
series remains challenging due to three key discrepancies: (1) data-modality
gap between structured, bounded image data and unbounded, heterogeneous time
series; (2) multivariate-forecasting gap between standard RGB
three-channel-based vision models and the need to model time series with
arbitrary numbers of variates; and (3) probabilistic-forecasting gap between
the deterministic output formats of most vision models and the requirement for
uncertainty-aware probabilistic predictions. To bridge these gaps, we propose
VisionTS++, a vision-model-based TSFM that performs continual pre-training on
large-scale time series datasets, including 3 innovations: (1) a
vision-model-based filtering mechanism to identify high-quality time series
data, thereby mitigating modality gap and improving pre-training stability, (2)
a colorized multivariate conversion method that transforms multivariate time
series into multi-subfigure RGB images, capturing complex inter-variate
dependencies; and (3) a multi-quantile forecasting approach using parallel
reconstruction heads to generate forecasts of different quantile levels, thus
more flexibly approximating arbitrary output distributions without restrictive
prior distributional assumptions. Evaluated on both in-distribution and
out-of-distribution TSF benchmarks, \model achieves SOTA results, outperforming
specialized TSFMs by 6%-44% in MSE reduction and ranking first in 9 out of 12
probabilistic forecasting settings. Our work establishes a new paradigm for
cross-modal knowledge transfer, advancing the development of universal TSFMs.

TL;DR: ProtoN提出了一种基于图的少样本学习框架，通过联合处理多个耳部印象来提升身份识别性能，显著提高了识别准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 耳部生物识别虽稳定且无需接触，但受限于标注数据稀缺和类内变异性大。现有方法通常单独处理印象，难以捕捉一致且具区分性的特征。

Method: ProtoN采用图神经网络（PGNN）层，通过双路径消息传递机制优化印象和原型表示，并结合跨图原型对齐策略和混合损失函数。

Result: 在五个基准耳部数据集上，ProtoN实现了最高99.60%的Rank-1识别准确率和0.025的EER。

Conclusion: ProtoN在少样本耳部识别中表现出色，显著提升了性能，适用于数据有限场景。

Abstract: Ear biometrics offer a stable and contactless modality for identity
recognition, yet their effectiveness remains limited by the scarcity of
annotated data and significant intra-class variability. Existing methods
typically extract identity features from individual impressions in isolation,
restricting their ability to capture consistent and discriminative
representations. To overcome these limitations, a few-shot learning framework,
ProtoN, is proposed to jointly process multiple impressions of an identity
using a graph-based approach. Each impression is represented as a node in a
class-specific graph, alongside a learnable prototype node that encodes
identity-level information. This graph is processed by a Prototype Graph Neural
Network (PGNN) layer, specifically designed to refine both impression and
prototype representations through a dual-path message-passing mechanism. To
further enhance discriminative power, the PGNN incorporates a cross-graph
prototype alignment strategy that improves class separability by enforcing
intra-class compactness while maintaining inter-class distinction.
Additionally, a hybrid loss function is employed to balance episodic and global
classification objectives, thereby improving the overall structure of the
embedding space. Extensive experiments on five benchmark ear datasets
demonstrate that ProtoN achieves state-of-the-art performance, with Rank-1
identification accuracy of up to 99.60% and an Equal Error Rate (EER) as low as
0.025, showing the effectiveness for few-shot ear recognition under limited
data conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有建筑改造对气候影响至关重要，但早期规划需要基于LoD3热模型的模拟，而现有方法在特征识别上存在挑战。

Method: SI3FP结合计算机视觉和深度学习，直接从正交图像平面建模几何基元，减少透视失真，支持稀疏和密集数据源。

Result: 在瑞典典型住宅建筑上测试，SI3FP的窗墙比估计误差约为5%，满足早期改造分析需求。

Conclusion: SI3FP为大规模能源改造规划提供了高效工具，并在城市发展和规划中有广泛应用。

Abstract: Renovating existing buildings is essential for climate impact. Early-phase
renovation planning requires simulations based on thermal 3D models at Level of
Detail (LoD) 3, which include features like windows. However, scalable and
accurate identification of such features remains a challenge. This paper
presents the Scalable Image-to-3D Facade Parser (SI3FP), a pipeline that
generates LoD3 thermal models by extracting geometries from images using both
computer vision and deep learning. Unlike existing methods relying on
segmentation and projection, SI3FP directly models geometric primitives in the
orthographic image plane, providing a unified interface while reducing
perspective distortions. SI3FP supports both sparse (e.g., Google Street View)
and dense (e.g., hand-held camera) data sources. Tested on typical Swedish
residential buildings, SI3FP achieved approximately 5% error in window-to-wall
ratio estimates, demonstrating sufficient accuracy for early-stage renovation
analysis. The pipeline facilitates large-scale energy renovation planning and
has broader applications in urban development and planning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态大语言模型在视频推理中的跨模态交互不足和幻觉问题。

Method: 使用视觉工具箱密集采样视频帧，生成多模态思维链，并提出DGRPO算法优化多任务强化学习。

Result: 在11个视频理解基准测试中表现优异，尤其在长视频场景下。

Conclusion: VITAL框架显著提升视频推理能力，代码和数据将公开。

Abstract: The video reasoning ability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) is
crucial for downstream tasks like video question answering and temporal
grounding. While recent approaches have explored text-based chain-of-thought
(CoT) reasoning for MLLMs, these methods often suffer from limited cross-modal
interaction and increased hallucination, especially with longer videos or
reasoning chains. To address these challenges, we propose Video Intelligence
via Tool-Augmented Learning (VITAL), a novel end-to-end agentic video reasoning
framework. With a visual toolbox, the model can densely sample new video frames
on demand and generate multimodal CoT for precise long video reasoning. We
observe that temporal grounding and question answering are mutually beneficial
for video understanding tasks. Therefore, we construct two high-quality
multi-task video reasoning datasets MTVR-CoT-72k for supervised fine-tuning and
MTVR-RL-110k for reinforcement learning. Moreover, we propose a
Difficulty-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization algorithm (DGRPO) to
mitigate difficulty imbalance in multi-task reinforcement learning. Extensive
experiments on 11 challenging video understanding benchmarks demonstrate the
advanced reasoning ability of VITAL, outperforming existing methods in video
question answering and temporal grounding tasks, especially in long video
scenarios. All code, data and model weight will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新型的可变形跨任务自注意力机制，用于解决多任务学习中Transformer计算效率低的问题，显著降低了计算量和推理延迟，同时提升了任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多任务学习中，Transformer的多头注意力机制由于注意力矩阵规模随任务数量呈二次方增长，计算效率低下，难以满足实际硬件限制的需求。

Method: 提出了一种名为可变形跨任务自注意力的新方法，能够更高效地聚合不同任务的特征图信息。

Result: 在NYUD-v2和PASCAL-Context数据集上的实验表明，该方法在计算量（FLOPs）和推理延迟上降低了一个数量级，同时任务预测质量指标提升了高达7.4%。

Conclusion: 可变形跨任务自注意力机制为多任务学习提供了一种高效且性能优越的解决方案。

Abstract: In both Computer Vision and the wider Deep Learning field, the Transformer
architecture is well-established as state-of-the-art for many applications. For
Multitask Learning, however, where there may be many more queries necessary
compared to single-task models, its Multi-Head-Attention often approaches the
limits of what is computationally feasible considering practical hardware
limitations. This is due to the fact that the size of the attention matrix
scales quadratically with the number of tasks (assuming roughly equal numbers
of queries for all tasks). As a solution, we propose our novel Deformable
Inter-Task Self-Attention for Multitask models that enables the much more
efficient aggregation of information across the feature maps from different
tasks. In our experiments on the NYUD-v2 and PASCAL-Context datasets, we
demonstrate an order-of-magnitude reduction in both FLOPs count and inference
latency. At the same time, we also achieve substantial improvements by up to
7.4% in the individual tasks' prediction quality metrics.

Motivation: 解决多模态系统中基于用户意图的细粒度视觉内容检索问题，现有方法局限于图像级匹配，无法定位特定对象。

Method: 提出COR任务，构建COR127K基准，开发CORE模型，整合参考区域编码、自适应视觉-文本交互和区域级对比学习。

Result: CORE模型在基础和新型类别中显著优于现有模型，为细粒度多模态检索研究提供了有效基线。

Conclusion: COR任务和CORE模型为细粒度多模态检索开辟了新方向，解决了对象级检索的挑战。

Abstract: Retrieving fine-grained visual content based on user intent remains a
challenge in multi-modal systems. Although current Composed Image Retrieval
(CIR) methods combine reference images with retrieval texts, they are
constrained to image-level matching and cannot localize specific objects. To
this end, we propose Composed Object Retrieval (COR), a brand-new task that
goes beyond image-level retrieval to achieve object-level precision, allowing
the retrieval and segmentation of target objects based on composed expressions
combining reference objects and retrieval texts. COR presents significant
challenges in retrieval flexibility, which requires systems to identify
arbitrary objects satisfying composed expressions while avoiding semantically
similar but irrelevant negative objects within the same scene. We construct
COR127K, the first large-scale COR benchmark that contains 127,166 retrieval
triplets with various semantic transformations in 408 categories. We also
present CORE, a unified end-to-end model that integrates reference region
encoding, adaptive visual-textual interaction, and region-level contrastive
learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CORE significantly outperforms
existing models in both base and novel categories, establishing a simple and
effective baseline for this challenging task while opening new directions for
fine-grained multi-modal retrieval research.

Motivation: 解决病理学中标记数据有限的问题，利用自监督学习训练基础模型提升分类性能。

Method: 使用LoRA适应注意力机制，对比线性探测和端到端训练的CNN与Vision Transformer。

Result: LoRA适应模型性能优于线性探测，仅需10%数据接近全数据效果，域外性能差距显著缩小。

Conclusion: LoRA适应基础模型在有限数据下表现优异，但传统架构全微调仍具竞争力。

Abstract: The performance of deep learning models is known to scale with data quantity
and diversity. In pathology, as in many other medical imaging domains, the
availability of labeled images for a specific task is often limited.
Self-supervised learning techniques have enabled the use of vast amounts of
unlabeled data to train large-scale neural networks, i.e., foundation models,
that can address the limited data problem by providing semantically rich
feature vectors that can generalize well to new tasks with minimal training
effort increasing model performance and robustness. In this work, we
investigate the use of foundation models for mitotic figure classification. The
mitotic count, which can be derived from this classification task, is an
independent prognostic marker for specific tumors and part of certain tumor
grading systems. In particular, we investigate the data scaling laws on
multiple current foundation models and evaluate their robustness to unseen
tumor domains. Next to the commonly used linear probing paradigm, we also adapt
the models using low-rank adaptation (LoRA) of their attention mechanisms. We
compare all models against end-to-end-trained baselines, both CNNs and Vision
Transformers. Our results demonstrate that LoRA-adapted foundation models
provide superior performance to those adapted with standard linear probing,
reaching performance levels close to 100% data availability with only 10% of
training data. Furthermore, LoRA-adaptation of the most recent foundation
models almost closes the out-of-domain performance gap when evaluated on unseen
tumor domains. However, full fine-tuning of traditional architectures still
yields competitive performance.

Motivation: 当前LVLMs在需要深度视觉感知的任务中表现不足，主要原因是训练数据中视觉知识稀缺。

Method: 提出CVC任务，通过自动化实例构建管道生成训练数据，模型通过试错学习自我改进。

Result: 在四个专业任务和四个综合基准测试中表现显著提升，平均改进5.4%（7B模型）和4.0%（13B模型）。

Conclusion: CVC任务有效提升了LVLMs的视觉感知能力，且无需依赖复杂模型或人工干预。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have experienced significant
advancements in recent years. However, their performance still falls short in
tasks requiring deep visual perception, such as identifying subtle differences
between images. A potential cause is the scarcity of visual knowledge in
popular instruction-tuning corpora, resulting in inadequate visual perception
and reasoning capabilities. To address this challenge, we introduce a
self-improvement framework grounded in a novel visual knowledge-intensive task,
\underline{C}ausality-driven \underline{V}isual object \underline{C}ompletion
(CVC). This task requires LVLMs to infer the masked object in an image based on
its \textit{causal} relationships with the other visible information. We first
obtain rich examples cheaply through our automated instance construction
pipeline, without relying on sophisticated LVLMs (\textit{e.g.}, GPT-4V) or
human assistance. Then, LVLMs effectively self-improve through trial and error
learning using these created instances. Our experiments demonstrate substantial
gains across four challenging specialized tasks and four widely-used
comprehensive benchmarks. Especially on specialized tasks, our method achieves
an average improvement of 5.4\% and 4.0\% compared to the corresponding
baselines when utilizing LLaVA-1.5-7B and LLaVA-1.5-13B, respectively. The code

Result: 实验表明，4DVD在新视角合成和4D生成上达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 4DVD通过解耦和统一任务，实现了高质量的4D内容生成，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Given the high complexity of directly generating high-dimensional data such
as 4D, we present 4DVD, a cascaded video diffusion model that generates 4D
content in a decoupled manner. Unlike previous multi-view video methods that
directly model 3D space and temporal features simultaneously with stacked cross
view/temporal attention modules, 4DVD decouples this into two subtasks: coarse
multi-view layout generation and structure-aware conditional generation, and
effectively unifies them. Specifically, given a monocular video, 4DVD first
predicts the dense view content of its layout with superior cross-view and
temporal consistency. Based on the produced layout priors, a structure-aware
spatio-temporal generation branch is developed, combining these coarse
structural priors with the exquisite appearance content of input monocular
video to generate final high-quality dense-view videos. Benefit from this,
explicit 4D representation~(such as 4D Gaussian) can be optimized accurately,
enabling wider practical application. To train 4DVD, we collect a dynamic 3D
object dataset, called D-Objaverse, from the Objaverse benchmark and render 16
videos with 21 frames for each object. Extensive experiments demonstrate our
state-of-the-art performance on both novel view synthesis and 4D generation.

Abstract: The deployment of vision-language models remains constrained by substantial
computational requirements. We present \textbf{FrEVL}, a framework exploring
whether frozen pretrained embeddings can support effective vision-language
understanding. Our analysis reveals that frozen embeddings contain rich
information for discriminative tasks, achieving 85\% to 95\% of
state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks with only 68.4M trainable
parameters. This performance dichotomy reveals a critical insight: frozen
embedding effectiveness depends on alignment between pretraining objectives and
downstream task requirements. When accounting for end-to-end computation
including embedding extraction, FrEVL provides $2.3\times$ speedup with 52\%
lower energy consumption, making it suitable for scenarios with pre-computable
inputs or when deployment constraints outweigh marginal performance gains. Our
evaluation provides practitioners with guidance on when frozen embedding
approaches represent viable alternatives to full model deployment. We will
release our complete implementation and evaluation framework to facilitate
further research into efficient multi-modal understanding.

Motivation: 现有方法在消除有害概念时存在不完全擦除和生成质量下降的问题，需要一种更有效的解决方案。

Result: 实验证明，ErasePro在不同概念擦除任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: ErasePro是一种高效且有效的概念擦除方法，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Concept Erasure, which aims to prevent pretrained text-to-image models from
generating content associated with semantic-harmful concepts (i.e., target
concepts), is getting increased attention. State-of-the-art methods formulate
this task as an optimization problem: they align all target concepts with
semantic-harmless anchor concepts, and apply closed-form solutions to update
the model accordingly. While these closed-form methods are efficient, we argue
that existing methods have two overlooked limitations: 1) They often result in
incomplete erasure due to "non-zero alignment residual", especially when text
prompts are relatively complex. 2) They may suffer from generation quality
degradation as they always concentrate parameter updates in a few deep layers.
To address these issues, we propose a novel closed-form method ErasePro: it is
designed for more complete concept erasure and better preserving overall
generative quality. Specifically, ErasePro first introduces a strict
zero-residual constraint into the optimization objective, ensuring perfect
alignment between target and anchor concept features and enabling more complete
erasure. Secondly, it employs a progressive, layer-wise update strategy that
gradually transfers target concept features to those of the anchor concept from
shallow to deep layers. As the depth increases, the required parameter changes
diminish, thereby reducing deviations in sensitive deep layers and preserving
generative quality. Empirical results across different concept erasure tasks
(including instance, art style, and nudity erasure) have demonstrated the
effectiveness of our ErasePro.

Conclusion: QuantVSR通过STCA和LBA模块，有效解决了VSR模型量化问题，为实际应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown superior performance in real-world video
super-resolution (VSR). However, the slow processing speeds and heavy resource
consumption of diffusion models hinder their practical application and
deployment. Quantization offers a potential solution for compressing the VSR
model. Nevertheless, quantizing VSR models is challenging due to their temporal
characteristics and high fidelity requirements. To address these issues, we
propose QuantVSR, a low-bit quantization model for real-world VSR. We propose a
spatio-temporal complexity aware (STCA) mechanism, where we first utilize the
calibration dataset to measure both spatial and temporal complexities for each
layer. Based on these statistics, we allocate layer-specific ranks to the
low-rank full-precision (FP) auxiliary branch. Subsequently, we jointly refine
the FP and low-bit branches to achieve simultaneous optimization. In addition,
we propose a learnable bias alignment (LBA) module to reduce the biased
quantization errors. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate that our method obtains comparable performance with the FP model
and significantly outperforms recent leading low-bit quantization methods. Code

Result: 在Causal Triplet挑战中，因果增量嵌入在OOD场景中表现优异，显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 通过专注于干预行为的表示，因果增量嵌入有效提升了模型的OOD鲁棒性。

Abstract: Causal representation learning has attracted significant research interest
during the past few years, as a means for improving model generalization and
robustness. Causal representations of interventional image pairs, have the
property that only variables corresponding to scene elements affected by the
intervention / action are changed between the start state and the end state.
While most work in this area has focused on identifying and representing the
variables of the scene under a causal model, fewer efforts have focused on
representations of the interventions themselves. In this work, we show that an
effective strategy for improving out of distribution (OOD) robustness is to
focus on the representation of interventions in the latent space. Specifically,
we propose that an intervention can be represented by a Causal Delta Embedding
that is invariant to the visual scene and sparse in terms of the causal
variables it affects. Leveraging this insight, we propose a framework that is
capable of learning causal representations from image pairs, without any
additional supervision. Experiments in the Causal Triplet challenge demonstrate
that Causal Delta Embeddings are highly effective in OOD settings,
significantly exceeding baseline performance in both synthetic and real-world
benchmarks.

Abstract: Reconstructing realistic 3D human avatars from monocular videos is a
challenging task due to the limited geometric information and complex non-rigid
motion involved. We present MonoCloth, a new method for reconstructing and
animating clothed human avatars from monocular videos. To overcome the
limitations of monocular input, we introduce a part-based decomposition
strategy that separates the avatar into body, face, hands, and clothing. This
design reflects the varying levels of reconstruction difficulty and deformation
complexity across these components. Specifically, we focus on detailed geometry
recovery for the face and hands. For clothing, we propose a dedicated cloth
simulation module that captures garment deformation using temporal motion cues
and geometric constraints. Experimental results demonstrate that MonoCloth
improves both visual reconstruction quality and animation realism compared to
existing methods. Furthermore, thanks to its part-based design, MonoCloth also
supports additional tasks such as clothing transfer, underscoring its
versatility and practical utility.

Abstract: Current state-of-the-art methods for skeleton-based temporal action
segmentation are predominantly supervised and require annotated data, which is
expensive to collect. In contrast, existing unsupervised temporal action
segmentation methods have focused primarily on video data, while skeleton
sequences remain underexplored, despite their relevance to real-world
applications, robustness, and privacy-preserving nature. In this paper, we
propose a novel approach for unsupervised skeleton-based temporal action
segmentation. Our method utilizes a sequence-to-sequence temporal autoencoder
that keeps the information of the different joints disentangled in the
embedding space. Latent skeleton sequences are then divided into
non-overlapping patches and quantized to obtain distinctive skeleton motion
words, driving the discovery of semantically meaningful action clusters. We
thoroughly evaluate the proposed approach on three widely used skeleton-based

segmentation methods. Code is available at https://github.com/bachlab/SMQ .

TL;DR: RAIDX是一个结合RAG和GRPO的新型深度伪造检测框架，旨在提高检测准确性和决策可解释性，无需依赖大量人工标注。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度伪造检测方法缺乏透明性，且基于LLM的方法存在分析粗糙和依赖人工标注的问题。

Method: RAIDX整合了RAG（检索增强生成）和GRPO（组相对策略优化），利用外部知识提升检测准确性，并自动生成细粒度解释和显著性图。

Result: 实验表明，RAIDX在多个基准测试中表现出色，能够准确识别真假图像并提供可解释的文本描述和显著性图。

Conclusion: RAIDX是首个统一RAG和GRPO的框架，显著提升了深度伪造检测的准确性和可解释性。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of AI-generation models has enabled the creation of
hyperrealistic imagery, posing ethical risks through widespread misinformation.
Current deepfake detection methods, categorized as face specific detectors or
general AI-generated detectors, lack transparency by framing detection as a
classification task without explaining decisions. While several LLM-based
approaches offer explainability, they suffer from coarse-grained analyses and
dependency on labor-intensive annotations. This paper introduces RAIDX
(Retrieval-Augmented Image Deepfake Detection and Explainability), a novel
deepfake detection framework integrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to enhance detection accuracy and
decision explainability. Specifically, RAIDX leverages RAG to incorporate
external knowledge for improved detection accuracy and employs GRPO to
autonomously generate fine-grained textual explanations and saliency maps,
eliminating the need for extensive manual annotations. Experiments on multiple
benchmarks demonstrate RAIDX's effectiveness in identifying real or fake, and
providing interpretable rationales in both textual descriptions and saliency
maps, achieving state-of-the-art detection performance while advancing
transparency in deepfake identification. RAIDX represents the first unified
framework to synergize RAG and GRPO, addressing critical gaps in accuracy and
explainability. Our code and models will be publicly available.

standard benchmarks but falter in medical applications, our approach achieves
improved results on datasets like CBIS-DDSM, NuInsSeg and Kvasir-SEG.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为TopKD的框架，通过放大教师模型中最具信息量的logits（Top-K知识）来增强基于logit的知识蒸馏，无需额外模块或架构改动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识蒸馏方法主要关注特征级知识转移，而忽略了教师模型logit分布中的关键信息。

Method: TopKD包含两个组件：Top-K Scaling Module（TSM）自适应放大信息量最大的logits，以及Top-K Decoupled Loss（TDL）提供针对性监督。

Result: 在多个数据集（CIFAR-100、ImageNet等）上，TopKD均优于现有蒸馏方法，且在Vision Transformers上表现突出。

Conclusion: TopKD展示了logit在知识蒸馏中的巨大潜力，并具有广泛的适用性。

Abstract: Recent advances in knowledge distillation (KD) predominantly emphasize
feature-level knowledge transfer, frequently overlooking critical information
embedded within the teacher's logit distributions. In this paper, we revisit
logit-based distillation and reveal an underexplored yet critical element:
Top-K knowledge. Motivated by this insight, we propose Top-scaled Knowledge
Distillation (TopKD), a simple, efficient, and architecture-agnostic framework
that significantly enhances logit-based distillation. TopKD consists of two
main components: (1) a Top-K Scaling Module (TSM), which adaptively amplifies
the most informative logits, and (2) a Top-K Decoupled Loss (TDL), which offers
targeted and effective supervision. Notably, TopKD integrates seamlessly into
existing KD methods without introducing extra modules or requiring
architectural changes. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100, ImageNet, STL-10,
and Tiny-ImageNet demonstrate that TopKD consistently surpasses
state-of-the-art distillation methods. Moreover, our method demonstrates
substantial effectiveness when distilling Vision Transformers, underscoring its
versatility across diverse network architectures. These findings highlight the
significant potential of logits to advance knowledge distillation.

Conclusion: InceptoFormer通过结合局部和全局特征，显著提升了PD严重程度评估的性能。

Abstract: We present InceptoFormer, a multi-signal neural framework designed for
Parkinson's Disease (PD) severity evaluation via gait dynamics analysis. Our
architecture introduces a 1D adaptation of the Inception model, which we refer
to as Inception1D, along with a Transformer-based framework to stage PD
severity according to the Hoehn and Yahr (H&Y) scale. The Inception1D component
captures multi-scale temporal features by employing parallel 1D convolutional
filters with varying kernel sizes, thereby extracting features across multiple
temporal scales. The transformer component efficiently models long-range
dependencies within gait sequences, providing a comprehensive understanding of
both local and global patterns. To address the issue of class imbalance in PD
severity staging, we propose a data structuring and preprocessing strategy
based on oversampling to enhance the representation of underrepresented
severity levels. The overall design enables to capture fine-grained temporal
variations and global dynamics in gait signal, significantly improving
classification performance for PD severity evaluation. Through extensive
experimentation, InceptoFormer achieves an accuracy of 96.6%, outperforming
existing state-of-the-art methods in PD severity assessment. The source code

Conclusion: 分层事件记忆方法有效提升了OnVTG任务的性能，并实现了实时预测。

Abstract: In this paper, we tackle the task of online video temporal grounding (OnVTG),
which requires the model to locate events related to a given text query within
a video stream. Unlike regular video temporal grounding, OnVTG requires the
model to make predictions without observing future frames. As online videos are
streaming inputs and can go on indefinitely, it is impractical and inefficient
to store all historical inputs. The existing OnVTG models employ memory to
store recent historical video frame features and predict scores indicating
whether the current frame corresponds to the start or end time of the target
event. However, these methods lack effective event modeling and cannot retain
long-term historical information, leading to low performance. To tackle these
challenges, we propose a hierarchical event memory for OnVTG. We propose an
event-based OnVTG framework that makes predictions based on event proposals
that model event-level information with various durations. To preserve
historically valuable event information, we introduce a hierarchical event
memory that retains historical events, allowing the model to access both recent
and long-term information. To enable the real-time prediction, we further
propose a future prediction branch that predicts whether the target event will
occur shortly and further regresses the start time of the event. We achieve
state-of-the-art performance on the TACoS, ActivityNet Captions, and MAD
datasets. Code is available at https://github.com/minghangz/OnVTG.

Abstract: Marine videos present significant challenges for video understanding due to
the dynamics of marine objects and the surrounding environment, camera motion,
and the complexity of underwater scenes. Existing video captioning datasets,
typically focused on generic or human-centric domains, often fail to generalize
to the complexities of the marine environment and gain insights about marine
life. To address these limitations, we propose a two-stage marine
object-oriented video captioning pipeline. We introduce a comprehensive video
understanding benchmark that leverages the triplets of video, text, and
segmentation masks to facilitate visual grounding and captioning, leading to
improved marine video understanding and analysis, and marine video generation.
Additionally, we highlight the effectiveness of video splitting in order to
detect salient object transitions in scene changes, which significantly enrich
the semantics of captioning content. Our dataset and code have been released at

Motivation: 现有研究将虚拟试穿和虚拟试脱视为独立任务，忽略了它们的互补性。本文旨在填补这一空白，提出统一框架以同时解决这两个任务。

Conclusion: TWGTM是首个统一解决VTON和VTOFF的框架，通过双向特征解耦和分阶段训练实现了高性能的服装合成。

Abstract: While recent advances in virtual try-on (VTON) have achieved realistic
garment transfer to human subjects, its inverse task, virtual try-off (VTOFF),
which aims to reconstruct canonical garment templates from dressed humans,
remains critically underexplored and lacks systematic investigation. Existing
works predominantly treat them as isolated tasks: VTON focuses on garment
dressing while VTOFF addresses garment extraction, thereby neglecting their
complementary symmetry. To bridge this fundamental gap, we propose the Two-Way
Garment Transfer Model (TWGTM), to the best of our knowledge, the first unified
framework for joint clothing-centric image synthesis that simultaneously
resolves both mask-guided VTON and mask-free VTOFF through bidirectional
feature disentanglement. Specifically, our framework employs dual-conditioned
guidance from both latent and pixel spaces of reference images to seamlessly
bridge the dual tasks. On the other hand, to resolve the inherent mask
dependency asymmetry between mask-guided VTON and mask-free VTOFF, we devise a
phased training paradigm that progressively bridges this modality gap.
Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments conducted across the
DressCode and VITON-HD datasets validate the efficacy and competitive edge of
our proposed approach.

Abstract: As the leading cause of death worldwide, cardiovascular diseases motivate the
development of more sophisticated methods to analyze the heart and its
substructures from medical images like Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic
Resonance (MR). Semantic segmentations of important cardiac structures that
represent the whole heart are useful to assess patient-specific cardiac
morphology and pathology. Furthermore, accurate semantic segmentations can be
used to generate cardiac digital twin models which allows e.g.
electrophysiological simulation and personalized therapy planning. Even though
deep learning-based methods for medical image segmentation achieved great
advancements over the last decade, retaining good performance under domain
shift -- i.e. when training and test data are sampled from different data
distributions -- remains challenging. In order to perform well on domains known
at training-time, we employ a (1) balanced joint training approach that
utilizes CT and MR data in equal amounts from different source domains.
Further, aiming to alleviate domain shift towards domains only encountered at
test-time, we rely on (2) strong intensity and spatial augmentation techniques
to greatly diversify the available training data. Our proposed whole heart
segmentation method, a 5-fold ensemble with our contributions, achieves the
best performance for MR data overall and a performance similar to the best
performance for CT data when compared to a model trained solely on CT. With
93.33% DSC and 0.8388 mm ASSD for CT and 89.30% DSC and 1.2411 mm ASSD for MR
data, our method demonstrates great potential to efficiently obtain accurate
semantic segmentations from which patient-specific cardiac twin models can be
generated.

Conclusion: OMFA为虚拟服装合成提供了实用且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent diffusion-based approaches have made significant advances in
image-based virtual try-on, enabling more realistic and end-to-end garment
synthesis. However, most existing methods remain constrained by their reliance
on exhibition garments and segmentation masks, as well as their limited ability
to handle flexible pose variations. These limitations reduce their practicality
in real-world scenarios-for instance, users cannot easily transfer garments
worn by one person onto another, and the generated try-on results are typically
restricted to the same pose as the reference image. In this paper, we introduce
\textbf{OMFA} (\emph{One Model For All}), a unified diffusion framework for
both virtual try-on and try-off that operates without the need for exhibition
garments and supports arbitrary poses. For example, OMFA enables removing
garments from a source person (try-off) and transferring them onto a target
person (try-on), while also allowing the generated target to appear in novel
poses-even without access to multi-pose images of that person. OMFA is built
upon a novel \emph{partial diffusion} strategy that selectively applies noise
and denoising to individual components of the joint input-such as the garment,
the person image, or the face-enabling dynamic subtask control and efficient
bidirectional garment-person transformation. The framework is entirely
mask-free and requires only a single portrait and a target pose as input,
making it well-suited for real-world applications. Additionally, by leveraging
SMPL-X-based pose conditioning, OMFA supports multi-view and arbitrary-pose
try-on from just one image. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OMFA
achieves state-of-the-art results on both try-on and try-off tasks, providing a
practical and generalizable solution for virtual garment synthesis. The project

Abstract: The diffusion of drones presents significant security and safety challenges.
Traditional surveillance systems, particularly conventional frame-based
cameras, struggle to reliably detect these targets due to their small size,
high agility, and the resulting motion blur and poor performance in challenging
lighting conditions. This paper surveys the emerging field of event-based
vision as a robust solution to these problems. Event cameras virtually
eliminate motion blur and enable consistent detection in extreme lighting.
Their sparse, asynchronous output suppresses static backgrounds, enabling
low-latency focus on motion cues. We review the state-of-the-art in event-based
drone detection, from data representation methods to advanced processing
pipelines using spiking neural networks. The discussion extends beyond simple
detection to cover more sophisticated tasks such as real-time tracking,
trajectory forecasting, and unique identification through propeller signature
analysis. By examining current methodologies, available datasets, and the
distinct advantages of the technology, this work demonstrates that event-based
vision provides a powerful foundation for the next generation of reliable,
low-latency, and efficient counter-UAV systems.

Conclusion: TAlignDiff通过双向反馈优化牙齿对齐，为临床提供了新工具。

Abstract: Orthodontic treatment hinges on tooth alignment, which significantly affects
occlusal function, facial aesthetics, and patients' quality of life. Current
deep learning approaches predominantly concentrate on predicting transformation
matrices through imposing point-to-point geometric constraints for tooth
alignment. Nevertheless, these matrices are likely associated with the
anatomical structure of the human oral cavity and possess particular
distribution characteristics that the deterministic point-to-point geometric
constraints in prior work fail to capture. To address this, we introduce a new
automatic tooth alignment method named TAlignDiff, which is supported by
diffusion-based transformation learning. TAlignDiff comprises two main
components: a primary point cloud-based regression network (PRN) and a
diffusion-based transformation matrix denoising module (DTMD).
Geometry-constrained losses supervise PRN learning for point cloud-level
alignment. DTMD, as an auxiliary module, learns the latent distribution of
transformation matrices from clinical data. We integrate point cloud-based
transformation regression and diffusion-based transformation modeling into a
unified framework, allowing bidirectional feedback between geometric
constraints and diffusion refinement. Extensive ablation and comparative
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method,
highlighting its potential in orthodontic treatment.

Abstract: The Dense Audio-Visual Event Localization (DAVEL) task aims to temporally
localize events in untrimmed videos that occur simultaneously in both the audio
and visual modalities. This paper explores DAVEL under a new and more
challenging weakly-supervised setting (W-DAVEL task), where only video-level
event labels are provided and the temporal boundaries of each event are
unknown. We address W-DAVEL by exploiting \textit{cross-modal salient anchors},
which are defined as reliable timestamps that are well predicted under weak
supervision and exhibit highly consistent event semantics across audio and
visual modalities. Specifically, we propose a \textit{Mutual Event Agreement
Evaluation} module, which generates an agreement score by measuring the
discrepancy between the predicted audio and visual event classes. Then, the
agreement score is utilized in a \textit{Cross-modal Salient Anchor
Identification} module, which identifies the audio and visual anchor features
through global-video and local temporal window identification mechanisms. The
anchor features after multimodal integration are fed into an
\textit{Anchor-based Temporal Propagation} module to enhance event semantic
encoding in the original temporal audio and visual features, facilitating
better temporal localization under weak supervision. We establish benchmarks
for W-DAVEL on both the UnAV-100 and ActivityNet1.3 datasets. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: Obliviate是一种高效的去偏方法，能泛化至多种幻觉类型，代码和数据将公开。

Abstract: As scaling up training data has significantly improved the general multimodal
capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), they still suffer from
the hallucination issue, generating text that is inconsistent with the visual
input. This phenomenon motivates us to systematically investigate the role of
training data in hallucination. We introduce a new benchmark, POPEv2, which
consists of counterfactual images collected from the training data of LVLMs
with certain objects masked. Through comprehensive evaluation on POPEv2, we
find that current LVLMs suffer from training bias: they fail to fully leverage
their training data and hallucinate more frequently on images seen during
training. Specifically, they perform poorly on counterfactual images, often
incorrectly answering ``Yes'' to questions about masked objects. To understand
this issue, we conduct probing experiments on the models' internal components,
revealing that this training bias is primarily located in the language modeling
(LM) head. Based on these findings, we propose Obliviate, an efficient and
lightweight unlearning method designed to mitigate object hallucination via
training bias unlearning. Obliviate identifies the discrepancy between
ground-truth labels and model outputs on the training data as a proxy for bias
and adopts a parameter- and data-efficient fine-tuning strategy that only
updates the LM head. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach. While only reusing the training data and updating approximately 2\%
of the parameters, Obliviate significantly reduces hallucination across both
discriminative and generative tasks. Furthermore, it demonstrates strong
scalability with respect to both model size (2B to 72B) and training data
volume, and exhibits promising generalization to hallucination types beyond
object-level hallucination. Our code and data will be publicly released.

Abstract: This paper presents DDTracking, a novel deep generative framework for
diffusion MRI tractography that formulates streamline propagation as a
conditional denoising diffusion process. In DDTracking, we introduce a
dual-pathway encoding network that jointly models local spatial encoding
(capturing fine-scale structural details at each streamline point) and global
temporal dependencies (ensuring long-range consistency across the entire
streamline). Furthermore, we design a conditional diffusion model module, which
leverages the learned local and global embeddings to predict streamline
propagation orientations for tractography in an end-to-end trainable manner. We
conduct a comprehensive evaluation across diverse, independently acquired dMRI
datasets, including both synthetic and clinical data. Experiments on two
well-established benchmarks with ground truth (ISMRM Challenge and
TractoInferno) demonstrate that DDTracking largely outperforms current
state-of-the-art tractography methods. Furthermore, our results highlight
DDTracking's strong generalizability across heterogeneous datasets, spanning
varying health conditions, age groups, imaging protocols, and scanner types.
Collectively, DDTracking offers anatomically plausible and robust tractography,
presenting a scalable, adaptable, and end-to-end learnable solution for broad

Result: 仅用1.5%的数据训练的小型模型（0.23B和2B参数）性能优于或接近7B+医学视觉语言模型，mAP50提升9.82%。

Conclusion: K2Sight通过结合领域知识和空间结构，实现了高效训练和小型模型的高性能。

Abstract: In this work, we address the problem of grounding abnormalities in medical
images, where the goal is to localize clinical findings based on textual
descriptions. While generalist Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel in natural
grounding tasks, they often struggle in the medical domain due to rare,
compositional, and domain-specific terms that are poorly aligned with visual
patterns. Specialized medical VLMs address this challenge via large-scale
domain pretraining, but at the cost of substantial annotation and computational
resources. To overcome these limitations, we propose \textbf{Knowledge to Sight
(K2Sight)}, a framework that introduces structured semantic supervision by
decomposing clinical concepts into interpretable visual attributes, such as
shape, density, and anatomical location. These attributes are distilled from
domain ontologies and encoded into concise instruction-style prompts, which
guide region-text alignment during training. Unlike conventional report-level
supervision, our approach explicitly bridges domain knowledge and spatial
structure, enabling data-efficient training of compact models. We train compact
models with 0.23B and 2B parameters using only 1.5\% of the data required by
state-of-the-art medical VLMs. Despite their small size and limited training
data, these models achieve performance on par with or better than 7B+ medical
VLMs, with up to 9.82\% improvement in $mAP_{50}$. Code and models:

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种用于多类皮肤疾病分类的深度学习框架，评估了三种图像预处理技术，并比较了多种预训练模型。结果表明，DinoV2结合RGB预处理表现最佳，准确率达93%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 皮肤疾病分类因类间相似性高、类内变异性大以及病变纹理复杂而具有挑战性。现有深度学习辅助诊断系统的性能高度依赖图像预处理和模型架构。

Method: 研究系统评估了三种图像预处理技术（标准RGB、CMY色彩空间转换、CLAHE），并比较了预训练的卷积神经网络（DenseNet201、Efficient-NetB5）和基于Transformer的模型（ViT、Swin Transformer、DinoV2 Large）。

Result: DinoV2结合RGB预处理在所有变体中表现最佳，准确率达93%，F1分数也最高。Grad-CAM可视化进一步证实了RGB输入的精确定位能力。

Conclusion: 研究强调了有效预处理和模型选择在构建鲁棒且可解释的皮肤科辅助诊断系统中的重要性。

Abstract: Accurate skin disease classification is a critical yet challenging task due
to high inter-class similarity, intra-class variability, and complex lesion
textures. While deep learning-based computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems have
shown promise in automating dermatological assessments, their performance is
highly dependent on image pre-processing and model architecture. This study
proposes a deep learning framework for multi-class skin disease classification,
systematically evaluating three image pre-processing techniques: standard RGB,
CMY color space transformation, and Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram
Equalization (CLAHE). We benchmark the performance of pre-trained convolutional
neural networks (DenseNet201, Efficient-NetB5) and transformer-based models
(ViT, Swin Transformer, DinoV2 Large) using accuracy and F1-score as evaluation
metrics. Results show that DinoV2 with RGB pre-processing achieves the highest
accuracy (up to 93%) and F1-scores across all variants. Grad-CAM visualizations
applied to RGB inputs further reveal precise lesion localization, enhancing
interpretability. These findings underscore the importance of effective
pre-processing and model choice in building robust and explainable CAD systems
for dermatology.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在长序列处理或依赖深度传感器时表现不佳，需要一种更高效且不依赖深度传感器的解决方案。

Method: 将3D高斯映射与RGB-D SLAM系统结合，使用前馈循环预测模块直接从光流推断相机位姿，并引入局部图渲染技术。

Result: 在Replica和TUM-RGBD数据集上表现与SplaTAM相当，同时跟踪时间减少90%以上。

Conclusion: 该方法通过快速网络推断替代慢速优化，显著提升了3D重建的效率和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Incrementally recovering real-sized 3D geometry from a pose-free RGB stream
is a challenging task in 3D reconstruction, requiring minimal assumptions on
input data. Existing methods can be broadly categorized into end-to-end and
visual SLAM-based approaches, both of which either struggle with long sequences
or depend on slow test-time optimization and depth sensors. To address this, we
first integrate a depth estimator into an RGB-D SLAM system, but this approach
is hindered by inaccurate geometric details in predicted depth. Through further
investigation, we find that 3D Gaussian mapping can effectively solve this
problem. Building on this, we propose an online 3D reconstruction method using
3D Gaussian-based SLAM, combined with a feed-forward recurrent prediction
module to directly infer camera pose from optical flow. This approach replaces
slow test-time optimization with fast network inference, significantly
improving tracking speed. Additionally, we introduce a local graph rendering
technique to enhance robustness in feed-forward pose prediction. Experimental
results on the Replica and TUM-RGBD datasets, along with a real-world
deployment demonstration, show that our method achieves performance on par with
the state-of-the-art SplaTAM, while reducing tracking time by more than 90\%.

Motivation: 双耳对称性对CNN学习特征的影响尚未被充分研究，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 开发耳侧分类器自动区分左右耳，并在训练和测试中利用这一信息，同时进行跨数据集评估。

Result: 实验表明，分开处理左右耳能显著提升性能，并通过消融研究提供了优化CNN耳部识别系统的实用建议。

Conclusion: 双耳对称性信息对CNN耳部识别系统具有重要价值，分开处理左右耳能有效提升性能。

Abstract: Ear recognition has gained attention as a reliable biometric technique due to
the distinctive characteristics of human ears. With the increasing availability
of large-scale datasets, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely
adopted to learn features directly from raw ear images, outperforming
traditional hand-crafted methods. However, the effect of bilateral ear symmetry
on the features learned by CNNs has received little attention in recent
studies. In this paper, we investigate how bilateral ear symmetry influences
the effectiveness of CNN-based ear recognition. To this end, we first develop
an ear side classifier to automatically categorize ear images as either left or
right. We then explore the impact of incorporating this side information during
both training and test. Cross-dataset evaluations are conducted on five
datasets. Our results suggest that treating left and right ears separately
during training and testing can lead to notable performance improvements.
Furthermore, our ablation studies on alignment strategies, input sizes, and
various hyperparameter settings provide practical insights into training
CNN-based ear recognition systems on large-scale datasets to achieve higher
verification rates.

in financial numerical reasoning tasks. Compared to existing benchmarks, our
work introduces three significant advancements. (1) Multimodality: We
meticulously transform existing financial reasoning benchmarks, and construct
novel questions from the latest Chinese financial research reports. FinMMR
comprises 4.3K questions and 8.7K images spanning 14 categories, including
tables, bar charts, and ownership structure charts. (2) Comprehensiveness:

financial domain knowledge breadth. (3) Challenge: Models are required to
perform multi-step precise numerical reasoning by integrating financial
knowledge with the understanding of complex financial images and text. The
best-performing MLLM achieves only 53.0% accuracy on Hard problems. We believe
that FinMMR will drive advancements in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of

TL;DR: 论文介绍了EncQA基准测试，用于评估多模态视觉语言模型在图表理解中的视觉推理能力，发现模型性能在不同任务和编码间差异显著，且模型规模不总能提升性能。


<details>

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在图表理解基准测试中的进步未能全面覆盖视觉推理能力，需要更系统的评估方法。

Method: 提出EncQA基准测试，包含2,076个合成问题-答案对，覆盖6种视觉编码通道和8种分析任务，评估了9种先进模型。

Result: 模型性能在不同任务和编码间差异显著，模型规模对许多任务-编码组合的性能提升有限。

Conclusion: 提升图表理解需要针对特定视觉推理差距的策略，而非单纯扩大模型或数据集规模。

Abstract: Multimodal vision-language models (VLMs) continue to achieve ever-improving
scores on chart understanding benchmarks. Yet, we find that this progress does
not fully capture the breadth of visual reasoning capabilities essential for
interpreting charts. We introduce EncQA, a novel benchmark informed by the
visualization literature, designed to provide systematic coverage of visual
encodings and analytic tasks that are crucial for chart understanding. EncQA
provides 2,076 synthetic question-answer pairs, enabling balanced coverage of
six visual encoding channels (position, length, area, color quantitative, color
nominal, and shape) and eight tasks (find extrema, retrieve value, find
anomaly, filter values, compute derived value exact, compute derived value
relative, correlate values, and correlate values relative). Our evaluation of 9
state-of-the-art VLMs reveals that performance varies significantly across
encodings within the same task, as well as across tasks. Contrary to
expectations, we observe that performance does not improve with model size for
many task-encoding pairs. Our results suggest that advancing chart
understanding requires targeted strategies addressing specific visual reasoning
gaps, rather than solely scaling up model or dataset size.

Result: X-SAM在多个图像分割基准测试中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: X-SAM为多模态像素级视觉理解提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong capabilities in broad
knowledge representation, yet they are inherently deficient in pixel-level
perceptual understanding. Although the Segment Anything Model (SAM) represents
a significant advancement in visual-prompt-driven image segmentation, it
exhibits notable limitations in multi-mask prediction and category-specific
segmentation tasks, and it cannot integrate all segmentation tasks within a
unified model architecture. To address these limitations, we present X-SAM, a
streamlined Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) framework that extends the
segmentation paradigm from \textit{segment anything} to \textit{any
segmentation}. Specifically, we introduce a novel unified framework that
enables more advanced pixel-level perceptual comprehension for MLLMs.
Furthermore, we propose a new segmentation task, termed Visual GrounDed (VGD)
segmentation, which segments all instance objects with interactive visual
prompts and empowers MLLMs with visual grounded, pixel-wise interpretative
capabilities. To enable effective training on diverse data sources, we present
a unified training strategy that supports co-training across multiple datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate that X-SAM achieves state-of-the-art
performance on a wide range of image segmentation benchmarks, highlighting its
efficiency for multimodal, pixel-level visual understanding. Code is available

Result: 在ScanNet++和2D-3D-Semantics基准测试中显著优于竞争对手。

Conclusion: PixCuboid方法灵活，可轻松扩展到多房间估计，代码和模型权重已开源。

Abstract: Coarse room layout estimation provides important geometric cues for many
downstream tasks. Current state-of-the-art methods are predominantly based on
single views and often assume panoramic images. We introduce PixCuboid, an
optimization-based approach for cuboid-shaped room layout estimation, which is
based on multi-view alignment of dense deep features. By training with the
optimization end-to-end, we learn feature maps that yield large convergence
basins and smooth loss landscapes in the alignment. This allows us to
initialize the room layout using simple heuristics.
  For the evaluation we propose two new benchmarks based on ScanNet++ and
2D-3D-Semantics, with manually verified ground truth 3D cuboids. In thorough
experiments we validate our approach and significantly outperform the
competition. Finally, while our network is trained with single cuboids, the
flexibility of the optimization-based approach allow us to easily extend to
multi-room estimation, e.g. larger apartments or offices. Code and model
weights are available at https://github.com/ghanning/PixCuboid.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模文本到图像扩散模型在资源受限设备上推理的挑战。

Method: 结合分层位置修剪、位置权重保护和敏感性引导蒸馏三种技术。

Result: 内存占用减少77.5-80.4%，延迟降低27.9-38.0%，输出质量损失最小。

Conclusion: HierarchicalPrune在保持感知质量的同时，显著优于先前工作，适用于设备端推理。

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-image diffusion models (DMs) achieve remarkable
quality, yet their massive parameter scale (8-11B) poses significant challenges
for inferences on resource-constrained devices. In this paper, we present
HierarchicalPrune, a novel compression framework grounded in a key observation:
DM blocks exhibit distinct functional hierarchies, where early blocks establish
semantic structures while later blocks handle texture refinements.
HierarchicalPrune synergistically combines three techniques: (1) Hierarchical
Position Pruning, which identifies and removes less essential later blocks
based on position hierarchy; (2) Positional Weight Preservation, which
systematically protects early model portions that are essential for semantic
structural integrity; and (3) Sensitivity-Guided Distillation, which adjusts
knowledge-transfer intensity based on our discovery of block-wise sensitivity
variations. As a result, our framework brings billion-scale diffusion models
into a range more suitable for on-device inference, while preserving the
quality of the output images. Specifically, when combined with INT4 weight
quantisation, HierarchicalPrune achieves 77.5-80.4% memory footprint reduction
(e.g., from 15.8 GB to 3.2 GB) and 27.9-38.0% latency reduction, measured on
server and consumer grade GPUs, with the minimum drop of 2.6% in GenEval score
and 7% in HPSv2 score compared to the original model. Last but not least, our
comprehensive user study with 85 participants demonstrates that
HierarchicalPrune maintains perceptual quality comparable to the original model
while significantly outperforming prior works.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提示调优方法对弱语义扰动（如图像或文本噪声）的脆弱性导致模型泛化能力下降，ANPrompt旨在解决这一问题。

Method: ANPrompt通过融合原始和噪声扰动的文本嵌入构建噪声提示，生成抗噪声提示并注入编码器深层，同时计算噪声抵抗视觉提示原型（NRVPP）和引入多种损失目标。

Result: 在11个基准测试中，ANPrompt表现优于现有方法，具有更强的抗噪声能力和对新类别的泛化能力。

Conclusion: ANPrompt通过噪声提示和抗噪声目标显著提升了视觉语言模型在弱语义扰动下的鲁棒性和泛化性能。

Abstract: Prompt tuning has emerged as an efficient and effective technique for
adapting vision-language models (VLMs) with low computational overhead.
However, existing methods often overlook the vulnerability of prompt-tuned VLMs
to weak semantic perturbations-such as subtle image or text noise-that degrade
their generalization to unseen classes. To address this limitation, we propose
ANPrompt, a novel prompt tuning framework designed to enhance robustness under
such perturbations. ANPrompt first constructs weak noise text features by
fusing original and noise-perturbed text embeddings, which are then clustered
to form noise prompts. These noise prompts are integrated with learnable prompt
tokens to generate anti-noise prompts, which are injected into the deeper
layers of both image and text encoders. To further capture the noise-aware
visual semantics, ANPrompt computes the Noise-Resistant Visual Prompt Prototype
(NRVPP) by averaging the output prompt tokens from the vision encoder. Finally,
ANPrompt introduces alignment, robustness, and anti-noise objectives by
computing a Weak semantic noise Alignment Loss (WALoss) alongside the standard
cross-entropy and sim loss. Experiments across 11 benchmarks demonstrate that
ANPrompt consistently outperforms existing prompt tuning approaches, achieving
superior robustness to semantic noise and improved generalization to novel
categories.

Abstract: Learning action models from real-world human-centric interaction datasets is
important towards building general-purpose intelligent assistants with
efficiency. However, most existing datasets only offer specialist interaction
category and ignore that AI assistants perceive and act based on first-person
acquisition. We urge that both the generalist interaction knowledge and
egocentric modality are indispensable. In this paper, we embed the
manual-assisted task into a vision-language-action framework, where the
assistant provides services to the instructor following egocentric vision and
commands. With our hybrid RGB-MoCap system, pairs of assistants and instructors
engage with multiple objects and the scene following GPT-generated scripts.
Under this setting, we accomplish InterVLA, the first large-scale
human-object-human interaction dataset with 11.4 hours and 1.2M frames of
multimodal data, spanning 2 egocentric and 5 exocentric videos, accurate
human/object motions and verbal commands. Furthermore, we establish novel
benchmarks on egocentric human motion estimation, interaction synthesis, and
interaction prediction with comprehensive analysis. We believe that our
InterVLA testbed and the benchmarks will foster future works on building AI
agents in the physical world.

Abstract: End-to-end training of multi-agent systems offers significant advantages in
improving multi-task performance. However, training such models remains
challenging and requires extensive manual design and monitoring. In this work,
we introduce TurboTrain, a novel and efficient training framework for
multi-agent perception and prediction. TurboTrain comprises two key components:
a multi-agent spatiotemporal pretraining scheme based on masked reconstruction
learning and a balanced multi-task learning strategy based on gradient conflict
suppression. By streamlining the training process, our framework eliminates the
need for manually designing and tuning complex multi-stage training pipelines,
substantially reducing training time and improving performance. We evaluate
TurboTrain on a real-world cooperative driving dataset, V2XPnP-Seq, and
demonstrate that it further improves the performance of state-of-the-art
multi-agent perception and prediction models. Our results highlight that
pretraining effectively captures spatiotemporal multi-agent features and
significantly benefits downstream tasks. Moreover, the proposed balanced
multi-task learning strategy enhances detection and prediction.

Motivation: BEV感知在自动驾驶中至关重要，但现有研究主要关注BEV编码器和任务特定头，而忽略了表示学习的潜力。

Method: BEVCon引入两个对比学习模块：实例特征对比模块和视角对比模块，结合检测损失进行密集对比学习。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上，BEVCon比现有基线方法性能提升最高达2.4% mAP。

Conclusion: BEVCon证明了表示学习在BEV感知中的重要性，为传统任务特定优化提供了补充途径。

Abstract: We present BEVCon, a simple yet effective contrastive learning framework
designed to improve Bird's Eye View (BEV) perception in autonomous driving. BEV
perception offers a top-down-view representation of the surrounding
environment, making it crucial for 3D object detection, segmentation, and
trajectory prediction tasks. While prior work has primarily focused on
enhancing BEV encoders and task-specific heads, we address the underexplored
potential of representation learning in BEV models. BEVCon introduces two
contrastive learning modules: an instance feature contrast module for refining
BEV features and a perspective view contrast module that enhances the image
backbone. The dense contrastive learning designed on top of detection losses
leads to improved feature representations across both the BEV encoder and the
backbone. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that BEVCon
achieves consistent performance gains, achieving up to +2.4% mAP improvement
over state-of-the-art baselines. Our results highlight the critical role of
representation learning in BEV perception and offer a complementary avenue to
conventional task-specific optimizations.

TL;DR: ST-Occ提出了一种高效学习时空特征的3D占用表示框架，通过时空记忆和注意力机制提升预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多帧输入下3D占用预测的高处理成本和时空一致性问题。

Method: 采用时空记忆捕获历史信息，并结合不确定性感知的注意力机制。

Result: 性能提升3 mIoU，时间不一致性降低29%。

Conclusion: ST-Occ通过时空依赖显著提升了3D占用预测的准确性和一致性。

Abstract: 3D occupancy becomes a promising perception representation for autonomous
driving to model the surrounding environment at a fine-grained scale. However,
it remains challenging to efficiently aggregate 3D occupancy over time across
multiple input frames due to the high processing cost and the uncertainty and
dynamics of voxels. To address this issue, we propose ST-Occ, a scene-level
occupancy representation learning framework that effectively learns the
spatiotemporal feature with temporal consistency. ST-Occ consists of two core
designs: a spatiotemporal memory that captures comprehensive historical
information and stores it efficiently through a scene-level representation and
a memory attention that conditions the current occupancy representation on the
spatiotemporal memory with a model of uncertainty and dynamic awareness. Our
method significantly enhances the spatiotemporal representation learned for 3D
occupancy prediction tasks by exploiting the temporal dependency between
multi-frame inputs. Experiments show that our approach outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods by a margin of 3 mIoU and reduces the temporal
inconsistency by 29%.

### [132] [Uncertainty-aware Accurate Elevation Modeling for Off-road Navigation via Neural Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03890)
*Sanghun Jung,Daehoon Gwak,Byron Boots,James Hays*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于神经过程（NPs）的方法，用于实时精确估计地形高程变化并量化不确定性，结合LiDAR和相机语义特征提升精度，并通过局部注意力机制降低计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如高斯过程和神经网络）无法同时满足实时性、精确性和不确定性量化的需求，特别是在复杂地形中。

Method: 结合神经过程的贝叶斯不确定性估计与神经网络效率，利用LiDAR和相机语义特征，引入局部注意力机制降低计算复杂度。

Result: 在复杂地形数据集上表现优于基线方法，计算复杂度降低17%，同时保持高程精度。

Conclusion: 神经过程为复杂地形建模提供了高效且表达力强的方法，适用于实时导航任务。

Abstract: Terrain elevation modeling for off-road navigation aims to accurately
estimate changes in terrain geometry in real-time and quantify the
corresponding uncertainties. Having precise estimations and uncertainties plays
a crucial role in planning and control algorithms to explore safe and reliable
maneuver strategies. However, existing approaches, such as Gaussian Processes
(GPs) and neural network-based methods, often fail to meet these needs. They
are either unable to perform in real-time due to high computational demands,
underestimating sharp geometry changes, or harming elevation accuracy when
learned with uncertainties. Recently, Neural Processes (NPs) have emerged as a
promising approach that integrates the Bayesian uncertainty estimation of GPs
with the efficiency and flexibility of neural networks. Inspired by NPs, we
propose an effective NP-based method that precisely estimates sharp elevation
changes and quantifies the corresponding predictive uncertainty without losing
elevation accuracy. Our method leverages semantic features from LiDAR and
camera sensors to improve interpolation and extrapolation accuracy in
unobserved regions. Also, we introduce a local ball-query attention mechanism
to effectively reduce the computational complexity of global attention by 17\%
while preserving crucial local and spatial information. We evaluate our method
on off-road datasets having interesting geometric features, collected from
trails, deserts, and hills. Our results demonstrate superior performance over
baselines and showcase the potential of neural processes for effective and
expressive terrain modeling in complex off-road environments.

TL;DR: CP-Gen利用单条专家轨迹生成包含新物体几何和姿态的机器人演示数据，训练出的策略在真实世界中零样本迁移且泛化性强。

Result: 在仿真和真实任务中，CP-Gen训练的策略平均成功率77%，优于基线50%。

Conclusion: CP-Gen能高效生成多样化数据，显著提升机器人策略的泛化能力和成功率。

Abstract: Large-scale demonstration data has powered key breakthroughs in robot
manipulation, but collecting that data remains costly and time-consuming. We
present Constraint-Preserving Data Generation (CP-Gen), a method that uses a
single expert trajectory to generate robot demonstrations containing novel
object geometries and poses. These generated demonstrations are used to train
closed-loop visuomotor policies that transfer zero-shot to the real world and
generalize across variations in object geometries and poses. Similar to prior
work using pose variations for data generation, CP-Gen first decomposes expert
demonstrations into free-space motions and robot skills. But unlike those
works, we achieve geometry-aware data generation by formulating robot skills as
keypoint-trajectory constraints: keypoints on the robot or grasped object must
track a reference trajectory defined relative to a task-relevant object. To
generate a new demonstration, CP-Gen samples pose and geometry transforms for
each task-relevant object, then applies these transforms to the object and its
associated keypoints or keypoint trajectories. We optimize robot joint
configurations so that the keypoints on the robot or grasped object track the
transformed keypoint trajectory, and then motion plan a collision-free path to
the first optimized joint configuration. Experiments on 16 simulation tasks and
four real-world tasks, featuring multi-stage, non-prehensile and
tight-tolerance manipulation, show that policies trained using CP-Gen achieve
an average success rate of 77%, outperforming the best baseline that achieves
an average of 50%.

Abstract: This paper presents a method for optimizing the sliding mode control (SMC)
parameter for a robot manipulator applying a genetic algorithm (GA). The
objective of the SMC is to achieve precise and consistent tracking of the
trajectory of the robot manipulator under uncertain and disturbed conditions.
However, the system effectiveness and robustness depend on the choice of the
SMC parameters, which is a difficult and crucial task. To solve this problem, a
genetic algorithm is used to locate the optimal values of these parameters that
gratify the capability criteria. The proposed method is efficient compared with
the conventional SMC and Fuzzy-SMC. The simulation results show that the
genetic algorithm with SMC can achieve better tracking capability and reduce
the chattering effect.

Abstract: Accurate measurement of enteric methane emissions remains a critical
bottleneck for advancing livestock sustainability through genetic selection and
precision management. Existing ambient sampling approaches suffer from low data
retention rates, environmental interference, and limited temporal resolution.
We developed SCOUT (Smart Cannula-mounted Optical Unit for Trace-methane), the
first robust in-vivo sensing system enabling continuous, high-resolution
monitoring of ruminal methane concentrations through an innovative closed-loop
gas recirculation design. We conducted comprehensive validation with two
cannulated Simmental heifers under contrasting dietary treatments, with
cross-platform comparison against established ambient sniffer systems. SCOUT
achieved exceptional performance with 82% data retention compared to 17% for
conventional sniffer systems, while capturing methane concentrations 100-1000x
higher than ambient approaches. Cross-platform validation demonstrated strong
scale-dependent correlations, with optimal correlation strength (r = -0.564
$\pm$ 0.007) at biologically relevant 40-minute windows and 100% statistical
significance. High-frequency monitoring revealed novel behavior-emission
coupling, including rapid concentration changes (14.5 $\pm$ 11.3k ppm)
triggered by postural transitions within 15 minutes, insights previously
inaccessible through existing technologies. The SCOUT system represents a
transformative advancement, enabling accurate, continuous emission phenotyping
essential for genomic selection programs and sustainable precision livestock
management. This validation framework establishes new benchmarks for
agricultural sensor performance while generating unprecedented biological
insights into ruminal methane dynamics, contributing essential tools for
sustainable livestock production in climate-conscious agricultural systems.

Conclusion: DRIVE框架高效、可解释且稳健，适合实际部署。

Abstract: Understanding and adhering to soft constraints is essential for safe and
socially compliant autonomous driving. However, such constraints are often
implicit, context-dependent, and difficult to specify explicitly. In this work,
we present DRIVE, a novel framework for Dynamic Rule Inference and Verified
Evaluation that models and evaluates human-like driving constraints from expert
demonstrations. DRIVE leverages exponential-family likelihood modeling to
estimate the feasibility of state transitions, constructing a probabilistic
representation of soft behavioral rules that vary across driving contexts.
These learned rule distributions are then embedded into a convex
optimization-based planning module, enabling the generation of trajectories
that are not only dynamically feasible but also compliant with inferred human
preferences. Unlike prior approaches that rely on fixed constraint forms or
purely reward-based modeling, DRIVE offers a unified framework that tightly
couples rule inference with trajectory-level decision-making. It supports both
data-driven constraint generalization and principled feasibility verification.
We validate DRIVE on large-scale naturalistic driving datasets, including inD,
highD, and RoundD, and benchmark it against representative inverse constraint
learning and planning baselines. Experimental results show that DRIVE achieves
0.0% soft constraint violation rates, smoother trajectories, and stronger
generalization across diverse driving scenarios. Verified evaluations further
demonstrate the efficiency, explanability, and robustness of the framework for
real-world deployment.

potential of GPU-based planning pipelines for scalable, adaptable deployment in
modern industrial workflows.

Abstract: Tactile gesture recognition systems play a crucial role in Human-Robot
Interaction (HRI) by enabling intuitive communication between humans and
robots. The literature mainly addresses this problem by applying machine
learning techniques to classify sequences of tactile images encoding the
pressure distribution generated when executing the gestures. However, some
gestures can be hard to differentiate based on the information provided by
tactile images alone. In this paper, we present a simple yet effective way to
improve the accuracy of a gesture recognition classifier. Our approach focuses
solely on processing the tactile images used as input by the classifier. In
particular, we propose to explicitly highlight the dynamics of the contact in
the tactile image by computing the dense optical flow. This additional
information makes it easier to distinguish between gestures that produce
similar tactile images but exhibit different contact dynamics. We validate the
proposed approach in a tactile gesture recognition task, showing that a
classifier trained on tactile images augmented with optical flow information
achieved a 9% improvement in gesture classification accuracy compared to one
trained on standard tactile images.

Conclusion: 触觉陪伴机器人可增强放松技术的治疗效果。

Abstract: Children diagnosed with anxiety disorders are taught a range of strategies to
navigate situations of heightened anxiety. Techniques such as deep breathing
and repetition of mantras are commonly employed, as they are known to be
calming and reduce elevated heart rates. Although these strategies are often
effective, their successful application relies on prior training of the
children for successful use when faced with challenging situations. This paper
investigates a pocket-sized companion robot designed to offer a relaxation
technique requiring no prior training, with a focus on immediate impact on the
user's heart rate. The robot utilizes a tactile game to divert the user's
attention, thereby promoting relaxation. We conducted two studies with children
who were not diagnosed with anxiety: a 14-day pilot study with two children
(age 8) and a main study with 18 children (ages 7-8). Both studies employed a
within-subjects design and focused on measuring heart rate during tactile
interaction with the robot and during non-use. Interacting with the robot was
found to significantly lower the study participants' heart rate (p$<$0.01)
compared to the non-use condition, indicating a consistent calming effect
across all participants. These results suggest that tactile companion robots
have the potential to enhance the therapeutic value of relaxation techniques.

Result: 实验显示，该方法生成的轨迹更保守，降低了预测碰撞概率，但与基线规划相比，可能减少规划成功率。

Conclusion: 将随机控制器行为纳入规划器可有效减少碰撞风险，但需权衡规划成功率。

Abstract: Mobile robot motion planners rely on theoretical models to predict how the
robot will move through the world. However, when deployed on a physical robot,
these models are subject to errors due to real-world physics and uncertainty in
how the lower-level controller follows the planned trajectory. In this work, we
address this problem by presenting three methods of incorporating stochastic
controller behavior into the recombinant search space of the Kinodynamic
Efficiently Adaptive State Lattice (KEASL) planner. To demonstrate this work,
we analyze the results of experiments performed on a Clearpath Robotics Warthog
Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) in an off-road, unstructured environment using
two different perception algorithms, and performed an ablation study using a
full spectrum of simulated environment map complexities. Analysis of the data
found that incorporating stochastic controller sampling into KEASL leads to
more conservative trajectories that decrease predicted collision likelihood
when compared to KEASL without sampling. When compared to baseline planning
with expanded obstacle footprints, the predicted likelihood of collisions
becomes more comparable, but reduces the planning success rate for baseline
search.

Abstract: Autonomous highway driving presents a high collision risk due to
fast-changing environments and limited reaction time, necessitating reliable
and efficient trajectory planning. This paper proposes a hybrid trajectory
planning framework that integrates the adaptability of learning-based methods
with the formal safety guarantees of optimization-based approaches. The
framework features a two-layer architecture: an upper layer employing a graph
neural network (GNN) trained on real-world highway data to predict human-like
longitudinal velocity profiles, and a lower layer utilizing path optimization
formulated as a mixed-integer quadratic programming (MIQP) problem. The primary
contribution is the lower-layer path optimization model, which introduces a
linear approximation of discretized vehicle geometry to substantially reduce
computational complexity, while enforcing strict spatiotemporal non-overlapping
constraints to formally guarantee collision avoidance throughout the planning
horizon. Experimental results demonstrate that the planner generates highly
smooth, collision-free trajectories in complex real-world emergency scenarios,
achieving success rates exceeding 97% with average planning times of 54 ms,
thereby confirming real-time capability.

Motivation: 解决多机器人在高风险、易失败、通信受限环境（如灾后区域、地下矿井等）中探索和绘制危险地图的挑战，需平衡信息收集与机器人存活率。

Conclusion: 行为自适应规划在复杂、高风险环境中具有显著优势，BAPP框架通过空间分区、移动基地重定位和角色异构实现高效扩展。

Abstract: We address the challenge of multi-robot autonomous hazard mapping in
high-risk, failure-prone, communication-denied environments such as
post-disaster zones, underground mines, caves, and planetary surfaces. In these
missions, robots must explore and map hazards while minimizing the risk of
failure due to environmental threats or hardware limitations. We introduce a
behavior-adaptive, information-theoretic planning framework for multi-robot
teams grounded in the concept of Behavioral Entropy (BE), that generalizes
Shannon entropy (SE) to capture diverse human-like uncertainty evaluations.
Building on this formulation, we propose the Behavior-Adaptive Path Planning
(BAPP) framework, which modulates information gathering strategies via a
tunable risk-sensitivity parameter, and present two planning algorithms:
BAPP-TID for intelligent triggering of high-fidelity robots, and BAPP-SIG for
safe deployment under high risk. We provide theoretical insights on the
informativeness of the proposed BAPP framework and validate its effectiveness
through both single-robot and multi-robot simulations. Our results show that
the BAPP stack consistently outperforms Shannon-based and random strategies:
BAPP-TID accelerates entropy reduction, while BAPP-SIG improves robot
survivability with minimal loss in information gain. In multi-agent
deployments, BAPP scales effectively through spatial partitioning, mobile base
relocation, and role-aware heterogeneity. These findings underscore the value
of behavior-adaptive planning for robust, risk-sensitive exploration in
complex, failure-prone environments.

Conclusion: $NavA^3$为通用具身导航提供了新方向，数据集和代码将公开。

Abstract: Embodied navigation is a fundamental capability of embodied intelligence,
enabling robots to move and interact within physical environments. However,
existing navigation tasks primarily focus on predefined object navigation or
instruction following, which significantly differs from human needs in
real-world scenarios involving complex, open-ended scenes. To bridge this gap,
we introduce a challenging long-horizon navigation task that requires
understanding high-level human instructions and performing spatial-aware object
navigation in real-world environments. Existing embodied navigation methods
struggle with such tasks due to their limitations in comprehending high-level
human instructions and localizing objects with an open vocabulary. In this
paper, we propose $NavA^3$, a hierarchical framework divided into two stages:
global and local policies. In the global policy, we leverage the reasoning
capabilities of Reasoning-VLM to parse high-level human instructions and
integrate them with global 3D scene views. This allows us to reason and
navigate to regions most likely to contain the goal object. In the local
policy, we have collected a dataset of 1.0 million samples of spatial-aware
object affordances to train the NaviAfford model (PointingVLM), which provides
robust open-vocabulary object localization and spatial awareness for precise
goal identification and navigation in complex environments. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that $NavA^3$ achieves SOTA results in navigation
performance and can successfully complete longhorizon navigation tasks across
different robot embodiments in real-world settings, paving the way for
universal embodied navigation. The dataset and code will be made available.

Abstract: Collecting real-world data for rare high-risk scenarios, long-tailed driving
events, and complex interactions remains challenging, leading to poor
performance of existing autonomous driving systems in these critical
situations. In this paper, we propose RoboTron-Sim that improves real-world
driving in critical situations by utilizing simulated hard cases. First, we
develop a simulated dataset called Hard-case Augmented Synthetic Scenarios
(HASS), which covers 13 high-risk edge-case categories, as well as balanced
environmental conditions such as day/night and sunny/rainy. Second, we
introduce Scenario-aware Prompt Engineering (SPE) and an Image-to-Ego Encoder
(I2E Encoder) to enable multimodal large language models to effectively learn
real-world challenging driving skills from HASS, via adapting to environmental
deviations and hardware differences between real-world and simulated scenarios.
Extensive experiments on nuScenes show that RoboTron-Sim improves driving
performance in challenging scenarios by around 50%, achieving state-of-the-art
results in real-world open-loop planning. Qualitative results further
demonstrate the effectiveness of RoboTron-Sim in better managing rare high-risk
driving scenarios. Project page: https://stars79689.github.io/RoboTron-Sim/

Abstract: How can we build general-purpose robot systems for open-world semantic
navigation, e.g., searching a novel environment for a target object specified
in natural language? To tackle this challenge, we introduce OSG Navigator, a
modular system composed of foundation models, for open-world Object-Goal
Navigation (ObjectNav). Foundation models provide enormous semantic knowledge
about the world, but struggle to organise and maintain spatial information
effectively at scale. Key to OSG Navigator is the Open Scene Graph
representation, which acts as spatial memory for OSG Navigator. It organises
spatial information hierarchically using OSG schemas, which are templates, each
describing the common structure of a class of environments. OSG schemas can be
automatically generated from simple semantic labels of a given environment,
e.g., "home" or "supermarket". They enable OSG Navigator to adapt zero-shot to
new environment types. We conducted experiments using both Fetch and Spot
robots in simulation and in the real world, showing that OSG Navigator achieves
state-of-the-art performance on ObjectNav benchmarks and generalises zero-shot

Conclusion: 研究为未来MARS的实际部署提供了改进方向，强调系统可靠性和安全性需通过边缘案例测试提升。

Abstract: Multi-agent robotic systems (MARS) build upon multi-agent systems by
integrating physical and task-related constraints, increasing the complexity of
action execution and agent coordination. However, despite the availability of
advanced multi-agent frameworks, their real-world deployment on robots remains
limited, hindering the advancement of MARS research in practice. To bridge this
gap, we conducted two studies to investigate performance trade-offs of
hierarchical multi-agent frameworks in a simulated real-world multi-robot
healthcare scenario. In Study 1, using CrewAI, we iteratively refine the
system's knowledge base, to systematically identify and categorize coordination
failures (e.g., tool access violations, lack of timely handling of failure
reports) not resolvable by providing contextual knowledge alone. In Study 2,
using AutoGen, we evaluate a redesigned bidirectional communication structure
and further measure the trade-offs between reasoning and non-reasoning models
operating within the same robotic team setting. Drawing from our empirical
findings, we emphasize the tension between autonomy and stability and the
importance of edge-case testing to improve system reliability and safety for
future real-world deployment. Supplementary materials, including codes, task
agent setup, trace outputs, and annotated examples of coordination failures and
reasoning behaviors, are available at:

Abstract: Accurate system identification is crucial for reducing trajectory drift in
bipedal locomotion, particularly in reinforcement learning and model-based
control. In this paper, we present a novel control framework that integrates
system identification into the reinforcement learning training loop using
differentiable simulation. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on direct
torque measurements, our method estimates system parameters using only
trajectory data (positions, velocities) and control inputs. We leverage the
differentiable simulator MuJoCo-XLA to optimize system parameters, ensuring
that simulated robot behavior closely aligns with real-world motion. This
framework enables scalable and flexible parameter optimization. Accurate system

*Zhan Li,Huangying Zhan,Changyang Li,Qingan Yan,Yi Xu*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: RLGS是一个基于强化学习的自适应超参数调优框架，用于3D高斯泼溅（3DGS），无需修改架构即可提升渲染质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS中的超参数调优过程繁琐且依赖专家经验，导致重建结果不一致且性能不佳。

Method: RLGS通过轻量级策略模块动态调整关键超参数（如学习率和密度化阈值），适用于多种3DGS变体。

Result: RLGS在多个数据集上表现稳健，例如在TNT数据集上将Taming-3DGS的PSNR提高了0.7dB。

Conclusion: RLGS为3DGS训练中的超参数调优提供了一种通用且高效的自动化解决方案。

Abstract: Hyperparameter tuning in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a labor-intensive
and expert-driven process, often resulting in inconsistent reconstructions and
suboptimal results. We propose RLGS, a plug-and-play reinforcement learning
framework for adaptive hyperparameter tuning in 3DGS through lightweight policy
modules, dynamically adjusting critical hyperparameters such as learning rates
and densification thresholds. The framework is model-agnostic and seamlessly
integrates into existing 3DGS pipelines without architectural modifications. We
demonstrate its generalization ability across multiple state-of-the-art 3DGS
variants, including Taming-3DGS and 3DGS-MCMC, and validate its robustness
across diverse datasets. RLGS consistently enhances rendering quality. For
example, it improves Taming-3DGS by 0.7dB PSNR on the Tanks and Temple (TNT)
dataset, under a fixed Gaussian budget, and continues to yield gains even when
baseline performance saturates. Our results suggest that RLGS provides an
effective and general solution for automating hyperparameter tuning in 3DGS
training, bridging a gap in applying reinforcement learning to 3DGS.

Abstract: The development of radiance fields (RF), such as 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
and Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), has revolutionized interactive
photorealistic view synthesis and presents enormous opportunities for XR
research and applications. However, despite the exponential growth of RF
research, RF-related contributions to the XR community remain sparse. To better
understand this research gap, we performed a systematic survey of current RF
literature to analyze (i) how RF is envisioned for XR applications, (ii) how
they have already been implemented, and (iii) the remaining research gaps. We
collected 365 RF contributions related to XR from computer vision, computer
graphics, robotics, multimedia, human-computer interaction, and XR communities,
seeking to answer the above research questions. Among the 365 papers, we
performed an analysis of 66 papers that already addressed a detailed aspect of
RF research for XR. With this survey, we extended and positioned XR-specific RF
research topics in the broader RF research field and provide a helpful resource
for the XR community to navigate within the rapid development of RF research.

### [151] [Surf3R: Rapid Surface Reconstruction from Sparse RGB Views in Seconds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04508)
*Haodong Zhu,Changbai Li,Yangyang Ren,Zichao Feng,Xuhui Liu,Hanlin Chen,Xiantong Zhen,Baochang Zhang*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: Surf3R是一种端到端的前馈方法，无需相机姿态估计即可从稀疏视图重建3D表面，并在10秒内完成整个场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的多视图3D重建方法依赖精确的相机校准和姿态估计，预处理复杂且耗时，限制了实际应用。

Method: 采用多分支多视图解码架构，通过分支处理、跨视图注意力和分支间融合捕捉几何线索，无需相机校准。引入D-Normal正则化器，基于3D高斯表示优化几何参数。

Result: 在ScanNet++和Replica数据集上达到最先进的性能，表现出优秀的泛化能力和效率。

Conclusion: Surf3R解决了传统方法的预处理瓶颈，实现了高效且高质量的3D重建。

Abstract: Current multi-view 3D reconstruction methods rely on accurate camera
calibration and pose estimation, requiring complex and time-intensive
pre-processing that hinders their practical deployment. To address this
challenge, we introduce Surf3R, an end-to-end feedforward approach that
reconstructs 3D surfaces from sparse views without estimating camera poses and
completes an entire scene in under 10 seconds. Our method employs a
multi-branch and multi-view decoding architecture in which multiple reference
views jointly guide the reconstruction process. Through the proposed
branch-wise processing, cross-view attention, and inter-branch fusion, the
model effectively captures complementary geometric cues without requiring
camera calibration. Moreover, we introduce a D-Normal regularizer based on an
explicit 3D Gaussian representation for surface reconstruction. It couples
surface normals with other geometric parameters to jointly optimize the 3D
geometry, significantly improving 3D consistency and surface detail accuracy.
Experimental results demonstrate that Surf3R achieves state-of-the-art
performance on multiple surface reconstruction metrics on ScanNet++ and Replica
datasets, exhibiting excellent generalization and efficiency.

TL;DR: 结合传统混合形状动画技术与机器学习模型，提出非实时和实时系统，提升3D风格化角色的表情动画效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改进基于性能的动画，使3D风格化角色的表情更具真实感和感知有效性。

Method: 非实时系统使用3D情感转移网络从2D图像生成3D角色参数；实时系统通过混合形状适应网络生成几何一致且时间稳定的参数。

Result: 与Faceware相比，系统的表情识别度、强度和吸引力评分显著更高。

Conclusion: 系统可集成到动画流程中，帮助动画师更快速准确地创建所需表情。

Abstract: Our purpose is to improve performance-based animation which can drive
believable 3D stylized characters that are truly perceptual. By combining
traditional blendshape animation techniques with multiple machine learning
models, we present both non-real time and real time solutions which drive
character expressions in a geometrically consistent and perceptually valid way.
For the non-real time system, we propose a 3D emotion transfer network makes
use of a 2D human image to generate a stylized 3D rig parameters. For the real
time system, we propose a blendshape adaption network which generates the
character rig parameter motions with geometric consistency and temporally
stability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our system by comparing to a
commercial product Faceware. Results reveal that ratings of the recognition,
intensity, and attractiveness of expressions depicted for animated characters
via our systems are statistically higher than Faceware. Our results may be
implemented into the animation pipeline, and provide animators with a system
for creating the expressions they wish to use more quickly and accurately.
