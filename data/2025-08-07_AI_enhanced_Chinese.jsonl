Similar to prior\nwork using pose variations for data generation, CP-Gen first decomposes expert\ndemonstrations into free-space motions and robot skills. But unlike those\nworks, we achieve geometry-aware data generation by formulating robot skills as\nkeypoint-trajectory constraints: keypoints on the robot or grasped object must\ntrack a reference trajectory defined relative to a task-relevant object. To\ngenerate a new demonstration, CP-Gen samples pose and geometry transforms for\neach task-relevant object, then applies these transforms to the object and its\nassociated keypoints or keypoint trajectories. We optimize robot joint\nconfigurations so that the keypoints on the robot or grasped object track the\ntransformed keypoint trajectory, and then motion plan a collision-free path to\nthe first optimized joint configuration.

The primary\ncontribution is the lower-layer path optimization model, which introduces a\nlinear approximation of discretized vehicle geometry to substantially reduce\ncomputational complexity, while enforcing strict spatiotemporal non-overlapping\nconstraints to formally guarantee collision avoidance throughout the planning\nhorizon. Experimental results demonstrate that the planner generates highly\nsmooth, collision-free trajectories in complex real-world emergency scenarios,\nachieving success rates exceeding 97% with average planning times of 54 ms,\nthereby confirming real-time capability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6df7\u5408\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c4\u5212\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u9ad8\u901f\u516c\u8def\u884c\u9a76\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u901f\u516c\u8def\u9a7e\u9a76\u73af\u5883\u53d8\u5316\u5feb\u3001\u53cd\u5e94\u65f6\u95f4\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u78b0\u649e\u98ce\u9669\u9ad8\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u53ef\u9760\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u5c42\u67b6\u6784\uff1a\u4e0a\u5c42\u7528\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u9884\u6d4b\u4eba\u7c7b\u9a7e\u9a76\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4e0b\u5c42\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u6574\u6570\u4e8c\u6b21\u89c4\u5212\u4f18\u5316\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u7ebf\u6027\u8fd1\u4f3c\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u590d\u6742\u7d27\u6025\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u5e73\u6ed1\u3001\u65e0\u78b0\u649e\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u7387\u8d85\u8fc797%\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u89c4\u5212\u65f6\u95f454\u6beb\u79d2\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u65f6\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u9ad8\u901f\u516c\u8def\u884c\u9a76\u3002"}}

In this paper, we propose a recommend system to assist machine\nlearning-based segmentation models, by suggesting appropriate image portions\nalong with the best modality, such that prostate cancer segmentation\nperformance can be maximised. Our approach trains a policy network that assists\ntumor localisation, by recommending both the optimal imaging modality and the\nspecific sections of interest for review. During training, a pre-trained\nsegmentation network mimics radiologist inspection on individual or variable\ncombinations of these imaging modalities and their sections - selected by the\npolicy network. Taking the locally segmented regions as an input for the next\nstep, this dynamic decision making process iterates until all cancers are best\nlocalised. We validate our method using a data set of 1325 labelled\nmultiparametric MRI images from prostate cancer patients, demonstrating its\npotential to improve annotation efficiency and segmentation accuracy,\nespecially when challenging pathology is present.

However, the use of up to billions of parameters incurs\nsignificant computational costs. Quantization offers a promising solution by\nreducing memory usage and accelerating inference.

To address these issues, we\npropose \\textbf{$\\text{S}^2$Q-VDiT}, a post-training quantization framework for\nV-DMs that leverages \\textbf{S}alient data and \\textbf{S}parse token\ndistillation. During the calibration phase, we identify that quantization\nperformance is highly sensitive to the choice of calibration data. To mitigate\nthis, we introduce \\textit{Hessian-aware Salient Data Selection}, which\nconstructs high-quality calibration datasets by considering both diffusion and\nquantization characteristics unique to V-DMs. To tackle the learning\nchallenges, we further analyze the sparse attention patterns inherent in V-DMs.\nBased on this observation, we propose \\textit{Attention-guided Sparse Token\nDistillation}, which exploits token-wise attention distributions to emphasize\ntokens that are more influential to the model's output.

However, this task\nis severely hindered by two major challenges: high intra-class variance and\nhigh inter-class similarity. Traditional methods often yield incomplete\nsegmentation results due to their inability to effectively unify class\nrepresentations and distinguish between similar features. Even emerging\nclass-guided approaches are limited by coarse class prototype representations\nand a neglect of target structural information.\n  Therefore, this paper proposes a Prototype-Driven Structure Synergy Network\n(PDSSNet).

Subsequently, the designed Semantic-Structure\nCoordination Module (SSCM) follows a hierarchical semantics-first,\nstructure-second principle. This involves first establishing a global semantic\ncognition, then leveraging structural information to constrain and refine the\nsemantic representation, thereby ensuring the integrity of class information.\nFinally, the Channel Similarity Adjustment Module (CSAM) employs a dynamic\nstep-size adjustment mechanism to focus on discriminative features between\nclasses.\n  Extensive experiments demonstrate that PDSSNet outperforms state-of-the-art\nmethods.

A particular challenge arises in\nscenarios where pedestrians suddenly appear from between parked vehicles, as\nthese parked vehicles act as temporary spatial obstructions. Furthermore, since\nparked vehicles are dynamic and may relocate over time, spatial information\nobtained from satellite maps or other predefined sources may not accurately\nreflect real-time road conditions, leading to erroneous sensor interpretations.\nTo address this limitation, we propose an NLoS pedestrian localization\nframework that integrates monocular camera image with 2D radar point cloud\n(PCD) data. The proposed method initially detects parked vehicles through image\nsegmentation, estimates depth to infer approximate spatial characteristics, and\nsubsequently refines this information using 2D radar PCD to achieve precise\nspatial inference. Experimental evaluations conducted in real-world urban road\nenvironments demonstrate that the proposed approach enhances early pedestrian\ndetection and contributes to improved road safety.

To address these limitations, we introduce VisualTrans, the first\ncomprehensive benchmark specifically designed for VTR in real-world\nhuman-object interaction scenarios. VisualTrans encompasses 12 semantically\ndiverse manipulation tasks and systematically evaluates three essential\nreasoning dimensions - spatial, procedural, and quantitative - through 6\nwell-defined subtask types. The benchmark features 472 high-quality\nquestion-answer pairs in various formats, including multiple-choice, open-ended\ncounting, and target enumeration. We introduce a scalable data construction\npipeline built upon first-person manipulation videos, which integrates task\nselection, image pair extraction, automated metadata annotation with large\nmultimodal models, and structured question generation.

While vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP offer strong\ngeneralization capabilities, their direct application to medical imaging\nanalysis is impeded by a significant domain gap. Existing approaches to bridge\nthis gap, including prompt learning and one-way modality interaction\ntechniques, typically focus on introducing domain knowledge to a single\nmodality. Although this may offer performance gains, it often causes modality\nmisalignment, thereby failing to unlock the full potential of VLMs. In this\npaper, we propose \\textbf{NEARL-CLIP} (i\\underline{N}teracted qu\\underline{E}ry\n\\underline{A}daptation with o\\underline{R}thogona\\underline{L} Regularization),\na novel cross-modality interaction VLM-based framework that contains two\ncontributions: (1) Unified Synergy Embedding Transformer (USEformer), which\ndynamically generates cross-modality queries to promote interaction between\nmodalities, thus fostering the mutual enrichment and enhancement of multi-modal\nmedical domain knowledge; (2) Orthogonal Cross-Attention Adapter (OCA). OCA\nintroduces an orthogonality technique to decouple the new knowledge from\nUSEformer into two distinct components: the truly novel information and the\nincremental knowledge.

However, there exist no\navailable datasets to evaluate the unlearning quality for security protection\nin biomedical MLLMs. To bridge this gap, we propose the first benchmark\nMultimodal Large Language Model Unlearning for BioMedicine (MLLMU-Med) built\nupon our novel data generation pipeline that effectively integrates synthetic\nprivate data and factual errors into the training set. Our benchmark targets\ntwo key scenarios: 1) Privacy protection, where patient private information is\nmistakenly included in the training set, causing models to unintentionally\nrespond with private data during inference; and 2) Incorrectness removal, where\nwrong knowledge derived from unreliable sources is embedded into the dataset,\nleading to unsafe model responses. Moreover, we propose a novel Unlearning\nEfficiency Score that directly reflects the overall unlearning performance\nacross different subsets. We evaluate five unlearning approaches on MLLMU-Med\nand find that these methods show limited effectiveness in removing harmful\nknowledge from biomedical MLLMs, indicating significant room for improvement.\nThis work establishes a new pathway for further research in this promising\nfield.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u57fa\u51c6MLLMU-Med\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u548c\u9519\u8bef\u77e5\u8bc6\u79fb\u9664\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\u3002", "motivation": "\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66MLLMs\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u80fd\u5305\u542b\u9690\u79c1\u4fe1\u606f\u6216\u9519\u8bef\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u90e8\u7f72\u540e\u51fa\u73b0\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u9732\u6216\u9519\u8bef\u8f93\u51fa\u3002\u5b8c\u5168\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u6280\u672f\u3002\u4f46\u76ee\u524d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8bc4\u4f30\u9057\u5fd8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86MLLMU-Med\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u6d41\u7a0b\u5c06\u5408\u6210\u9690\u79c1\u6570\u636e\u548c\u4e8b\u5b9e\u9519\u8bef\u6574\u5408\u5230\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u9057\u5fd8\u6548\u7387\u8bc4\u5206\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e94\u79cd\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66MLLMs\u4e2d\u79fb\u9664\u6709\u5bb3\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u4ecd\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "MLLMU-Med\u4e3a\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66MLLMs\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u6280\u672f\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002"}}

This survey offers the first focused and\nsystematic review of continual learning for VLMs (VLM-CL).

However, accurately forecasting crowd\ntrajectories remains a challenging task due to the inherently multimodal and\nuncertain nature of human motion. Recent diffusion-based models have shown\npromising results in capturing the stochasticity of pedestrian behavior for\ntrajectory prediction. However, few diffusion-based approaches explicitly\nincorporate the underlying motion intentions of pedestrians, which can limit\nthe interpretability and precision of prediction models. In this work, we\npropose a diffusion-based multimodal trajectory prediction model that\nincorporates pedestrians' motion intentions into the prediction framework. The\nmotion intentions are decomposed into lateral and longitudinal components, and\na pedestrian intention recognition module is introduced to enable the model to\neffectively capture these intentions.

One vital component often found in such document processing\nworkflows is document image classification, which, despite its widespread use,\nremains difficult to explain. While some recent works have attempted to explain\nthe decisions of document image classification models through\nfeature-importance maps, these maps are often difficult to interpret and fail\nto provide insights into the global features learned by the model. In this\npaper, we aim to bridge this research gap by introducing generative document\ncounterfactuals that provide meaningful insights into the model's\ndecision-making through actionable explanations. In particular, we propose\nDocVCE, a novel approach that leverages latent diffusion models in combination\nwith classifier guidance to first generate plausible in-distribution visual\ncounterfactual explanations, and then performs hierarchical patch-wise\nrefinement to search for a refined counterfactual that is closest to the target\nfactual image. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through a\nrigorous qualitative and quantitative assessment on 3 different document\nclassification datasets -- RVL-CDIP, Tobacco3482, and DocLayNet -- and 3\ndifferent models -- ResNet, ConvNeXt, and DiT -- using well-established\nevaluation criteria such as validity, closeness, and realism.

However, when the 3D scene contains depth variations\nand the camera baseline is significant, noticeable parallax occurs-meaning the\nrelative positions of scene elements differ substantially between views. Most\nexisting stitching methods struggle to handle such images with large parallax\neffectively. To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose an image\nstitching solution called PIS3R that is robust to very large parallax based on\nthe novel concept of deep 3D reconstruction. First, we apply visual geometry\ngrounded transformer to two input images with very large parallax to obtain\nboth intrinsic and extrinsic parameters, as well as the dense 3D scene\nreconstruction. Subsequently, we reproject reconstructed dense point cloud onto\na designated reference view using the recovered camera parameters, achieving\npixel-wise alignment and generating an initial stitched image. Finally, to\nfurther address potential artifacts such as holes or noise in the initial\nstitching, we propose a point-conditioned image diffusion module to obtain the\nrefined result.Compared with existing methods, our solution is very large\nparallax tolerant and also provides results that fully preserve the geometric\nintegrity of all pixels in the 3D photogrammetric context, enabling direct\napplicability to downstream 3D vision tasks such as SfM.

The knowledge graph explicitly models\nthe spatial and geometric relationships among vehicle parts through a\nstructured ontology, effectively encoding prior structural knowledge.\nMeanwhile, the context retrieval module enhances segmentation by identifying\nand leveraging visually similar vehicle instances from training data, providing\nrich contextual priors for improved generalization. Furthermore, we introduce a\nnew large-scale benchmark dataset for vehicle part segmentation, named\nVehicleSeg10K, which contains 11,665 high-quality pixel-level annotations\nacross diverse scenes and viewpoints. We conduct comprehensive experiments on\nthis dataset and two other datasets, benchmarking multiple representative\nbaselines to establish a solid foundation for future research and comparison. %\nBoth the dataset and source code of this paper will be released upon\nacceptance.

Recent\nadvancements in CSS have been largely driven by the adoption of Pre-trained\nVision Models (PVMs) as backbones. Among existing strategies, Direct\nFine-Tuning (DFT), which sequentially fine-tunes the model across classes,\nremains the most straightforward approach. Prior work often regards DFT as a\nperformance lower bound due to its presumed vulnerability to severe\ncatastrophic forgetting, leading to the development of numerous complex\nmitigation techniques. However, we contend that this prevailing assumption is\nflawed. In this paper, we systematically revisit forgetting in DFT across two\nstandard benchmarks, Pascal VOC 2012 and ADE20K, under eight CSS settings using\ntwo representative PVM backbones: ResNet101 and Swin-B. Through a detailed\nprobing analysis, our findings reveal that existing methods significantly\nunderestimate the inherent anti-forgetting capabilities of PVMs. Even under\nDFT, PVMs retain previously learned knowledge with minimal forgetting. Further\ninvestigation of the feature space indicates that the observed forgetting\nprimarily arises from the classifier's drift away from the PVM, rather than\nfrom degradation of the backbone representations. Based on this insight, we\npropose DFT*, a simple yet effective enhancement to DFT that incorporates\nstrategies such as freezing the PVM backbone and previously learned\nclassifiers, as well as pre-allocating future classifiers.

Benefiting from the design of learnable\nqueries, the DETR-based models have achieved substantial advancements in the\nTSG task. However, the absence of explicit supervision often causes the learned\nqueries to overlap in roles, leading to redundant predictions. Therefore, we\npropose to improve TSG by making each query fulfill its designated role,\nleveraging the length priors of the video-description pairs. In this paper, we\nintroduce the Length-Aware Transformer (LATR) for TSG, which assigns different\nqueries to handle predictions based on varying temporal lengths. Specifically,\nwe divide all queries into three groups, responsible for segments with short,\nmiddle, and long temporal durations, respectively.

The limitation arises from MLLMs'\ncontext limit and training costs, necessitating sparse frame sampling before\nfeeding videos into MLLMs. Existing video MLLMs adopt training-free uniform\nsampling or keyframe search, which may miss critical events or be constrained\nby the pre-trained models' event understanding capabilities. Meanwhile,\nbuilding a training-based method remains challenging due to the unsupervised\nand non-differentiable nature of sparse frame sampling. To address these\nproblems, we propose Temporal Sampling Policy Optimization (TSPO), advancing\nMLLMs' long-form video-language understanding via reinforcement learning.\nSpecifically, we first propose a trainable event-aware temporal agent, which\ncaptures event-query correlation for performing probabilistic keyframe\nselection. Then, we propose the TSPO reinforcement learning paradigm, which\nmodels keyframe selection and language generation as a joint decision-making\nprocess, enabling end-to-end group relative optimization with efficient\nrule-based rewards.

Our\narchitecture introduces a 1D adaptation of the Inception model, which we refer\nto as Inception1D, along with a Transformer-based framework to stage PD\nseverity according to the Hoehn and Yahr (H&Y) scale. The Inception1D component\ncaptures multi-scale temporal features by employing parallel 1D convolutional\nfilters with varying kernel sizes, thereby extracting features across multiple\ntemporal scales. The transformer component efficiently models long-range\ndependencies within gait sequences, providing a comprehensive understanding of\nboth local and global patterns. To address the issue of class imbalance in PD\nseverity staging, we propose a data structuring and preprocessing strategy\nbased on oversampling to enhance the representation of underrepresented\nseverity levels.

Unlike regular video temporal grounding, OnVTG requires the\nmodel to make predictions without observing future frames. As online videos are\nstreaming inputs and can go on indefinitely, it is impractical and inefficient\nto store all historical inputs. The existing OnVTG models employ memory to\nstore recent historical video frame features and predict scores indicating\nwhether the current frame corresponds to the start or end time of the target\nevent. However, these methods lack effective event modeling and cannot retain\nlong-term historical information, leading to low performance. To tackle these\nchallenges, we propose a hierarchical event memory for OnVTG. We propose an\nevent-based OnVTG framework that makes predictions based on event proposals\nthat model event-level information with various durations. To preserve\nhistorically valuable event information, we introduce a hierarchical event\nmemory that retains historical events, allowing the model to access both recent\nand long-term information. To enable the real-time prediction, we further\npropose a future prediction branch that predicts whether the target event will\noccur shortly and further regresses the start time of the event.

However, most existing methods remain constrained by their reliance\non exhibition garments and segmentation masks, as well as their limited ability\nto handle flexible pose variations. These limitations reduce their practicality\nin real-world scenarios-for instance, users cannot easily transfer garments\nworn by one person onto another, and the generated try-on results are typically\nrestricted to the same pose as the reference image. In this paper, we introduce\n\\textbf{OMFA} (\\emph{One Model For All}), a unified diffusion framework for\nboth virtual try-on and try-off that operates without the need for exhibition\ngarments and supports arbitrary poses. For example, OMFA enables removing\ngarments from a source person (try-off) and transferring them onto a target\nperson (try-on), while also allowing the generated target to appear in novel\nposes-even without access to multi-pose images of that person. OMFA is built\nupon a novel \\emph{partial diffusion} strategy that selectively applies noise\nand denoising to individual components of the joint input-such as the garment,\nthe person image, or the face-enabling dynamic subtask control and efficient\nbidirectional garment-person transformation. The framework is entirely\nmask-free and requires only a single portrait and a target pose as input,\nmaking it well-suited for real-world applications.

We\nconduct a comprehensive evaluation across diverse, independently acquired dMRI\ndatasets, including both synthetic and clinical data. Experiments on two\nwell-established benchmarks with ground truth (ISMRM Challenge and\nTractoInferno) demonstrate that DDTracking largely outperforms current\nstate-of-the-art tractography methods.

While generalist Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel in natural\ngrounding tasks, they often struggle in the medical domain due to rare,\ncompositional, and domain-specific terms that are poorly aligned with visual\npatterns. Specialized medical VLMs address this challenge via large-scale\ndomain pretraining, but at the cost of substantial annotation and computational\nresources. To overcome these limitations, we propose \\textbf{Knowledge to Sight\n(K2Sight)}, a framework that introduces structured semantic supervision by\ndecomposing clinical concepts into interpretable visual attributes, such as\nshape, density, and anatomical location. These attributes are distilled from\ndomain ontologies and encoded into concise instruction-style prompts, which\nguide region-text alignment during training. Unlike conventional report-level\nsupervision, our approach explicitly bridges domain knowledge and spatial\nstructure, enabling data-efficient training of compact models. We train compact\nmodels with 0.23B and 2B parameters using only 1.5\\% of the data required by\nstate-of-the-art medical VLMs. Despite their small size and limited training\ndata, these models achieve performance on par with or better than 7B+ medical\nVLMs, with up to 9.82\\% improvement in $mAP_{50}$.

To this end, we first develop\nan ear side classifier to automatically categorize ear images as either left or\nright. We then explore the impact of incorporating this side information during\nboth training and test. Cross-dataset evaluations are conducted on five\ndatasets. Our results suggest that treating left and right ears separately\nduring training and testing can lead to notable performance improvements.\nFurthermore, our ablation studies on alignment strategies, input sizes, and\nvarious hyperparameter settings provide practical insights into training\nCNN-based ear recognition systems on large-scale datasets to achieve higher\nverification rates.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u53cc\u8033\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u5bf9CNN\u8033\u90e8\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8033\u4fa7\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5206\u5f00\u5904\u7406\u5de6\u53f3\u8033\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u53cc\u8033\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u5bf9CNN\u5b66\u4e60\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5c1a\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u8033\u4fa7\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u81ea\u52a8\u533a\u5206\u5de6\u53f3\u8033\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e00\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8fdb\u884c\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5206\u5f00\u5904\u7406\u5de6\u53f3\u8033\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4f18\u5316CNN\u8033\u90e8\u8bc6\u522b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53cc\u8033\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u4fe1\u606f\u5bf9CNN\u8033\u90e8\u8bc6\u522b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u5206\u5f00\u5904\u7406\u5de6\u53f3\u8033\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

In this paper, we present\nHierarchicalPrune, a novel compression framework grounded in a key observation:\nDM blocks exhibit distinct functional hierarchies, where early blocks establish\nsemantic structures while later blocks handle texture refinements.\nHierarchicalPrune synergistically combines three techniques: (1) Hierarchical\nPosition Pruning, which identifies and removes less essential later blocks\nbased on position hierarchy; (2) Positional Weight Preservation, which\nsystematically protects early model portions that are essential for semantic\nstructural integrity; and (3) Sensitivity-Guided Distillation, which adjusts\nknowledge-transfer intensity based on our discovery of block-wise sensitivity\nvariations. As a result, our framework brings billion-scale diffusion models\ninto a range more suitable for on-device inference, while preserving the\nquality of the output images. Specifically, when combined with INT4 weight\nquantisation, HierarchicalPrune achieves 77.5-80.4% memory footprint reduction\n(e.g., from 15.8 GB to 3.2 GB) and 27.9-38.0% latency reduction, measured on\nserver and consumer grade GPUs, with the minimum drop of 2.6% in GenEval score\nand 7% in HPSv2 score compared to the original model.

Project website:\n  https://matthew-leng.github.io/stocc", "summary": "3D occupancy becomes a promising perception representation for autonomous\ndriving to model the surrounding environment at a fine-grained scale. However,\nit remains challenging to efficiently aggregate 3D occupancy over time across\nmultiple input frames due to the high processing cost and the uncertainty and\ndynamics of voxels. To address this issue, we propose ST-Occ, a scene-level\noccupancy representation learning framework that effectively learns the\nspatiotemporal feature with temporal consistency. ST-Occ consists of two core\ndesigns: a spatiotemporal memory that captures comprehensive historical\ninformation and stores it efficiently through a scene-level representation and\na memory attention that conditions the current occupancy representation on the\nspatiotemporal memory with a model of uncertainty and dynamic awareness. Our\nmethod significantly enhances the spatiotemporal representation learned for 3D\noccupancy prediction tasks by exploiting the temporal dependency between\nmulti-frame inputs. Experiments show that our approach outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art methods by a margin of 3 mIoU and reduces the temporal\ninconsistency by 29%.", "AI": {"tldr": "ST-Occ\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u65f6\u7a7a\u7279\u5f81\u76843D\u5360\u7528\u8868\u793a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u7a7a\u8bb0\u5fc6\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u5e27\u8f93\u5165\u4e0b3D\u5360\u7528\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u9ad8\u5904\u7406\u6210\u672c\u548c\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u65f6\u7a7a\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6355\u83b7\u5386\u53f2\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u53473 mIoU\uff0c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u964d\u4f4e29%\u3002", "conclusion": "ST-Occ\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u7a7a\u4f9d\u8d56\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e863D\u5360\u7528\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002"}}
