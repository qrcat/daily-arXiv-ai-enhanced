Traditional methods, such as\nextreme downsampling or transformation from the spatial to the frequency\ndomain, encounter significant drawbacks: downsampling induces irreversible\ninformation loss in UHD images, while our frequency analysis reveals that pure\nfrequency-domain approaches are ineffective for spatially confined image\nartifacts, primarily due to the loss of degradation locality. To overcome these\nlimitations, we present RetinexDual, a novel Retinex theory-based framework\ndesigned for generalized UHD IR tasks. RetinexDual leverages two complementary\nsub-networks: the Scale-Attentive maMBA (SAMBA) and the Frequency Illumination\nAdaptor (FIA). SAMBA, responsible for correcting the reflectance component,\nutilizes a coarse-to-fine mechanism to overcome the causal modeling of mamba,\nwhich effectively reduces artifacts and restores intricate details.

To verify\nthis, we created two different test setups.

The first test was conducted with two different groups\n(n=84) of human observers, a test group and a control group both interacting\nwith the robot. The second test was performed with 110 participants using\nincreasingly longer reaction delays for the robot with every ten participants.\nThe results show a statistically significant change (p$<$.05) in perceived\naffective impact for the robots when they react to an event shared with a human\nobserver rather than reacting at random. The result also shows for shared\nphysical interaction, the near-human reaction times from the robot are most\nappropriate for the scenario. The paper concludes that a delay time around\n200ms may render the biggest impact on human observers for small-sized\nnon-humanoid robots.

Teacher embeddings are\naligned to the student's space via a linear adapter and layer normalization,\nthen fused through our joint consensus gating, which weights each token by\ncombining cosine affinity with inter-teacher agreement.

Submitted to an IEEE conference", "summary": "Generative models have demonstrated significant success in anomaly detection\nand segmentation over the past decade. Recently, diffusion models have emerged\nas a powerful alternative, outperforming previous approaches such as GANs and\nVAEs. In typical diffusion-based anomaly detection, a model is trained on\nnormal data, and during inference, anomalous images are perturbed to a\npredefined intermediate step in the forward diffusion process. The\ncorresponding normal image is then reconstructed through iterative reverse\nsampling.\n  However, reconstruction-based approaches present three major challenges: (1)\nthe reconstruction process is computationally expensive due to multiple\nsampling steps, making real-time applications impractical; (2) for complex or\nsubtle patterns, the reconstructed image may correspond to a different normal\npattern rather than the original input; and (3) Choosing an appropriate\nintermediate noise level is challenging because it is application-dependent and\noften assumes prior knowledge of anomalies, an assumption that does not hold in\nunsupervised settings.\n  We introduce Reconstruction-free Anomaly Detection with Attention-based\ndiffusion models in Real-time (RADAR), which overcomes the limitations of\nreconstruction-based anomaly detection. Unlike current SOTA methods that\nreconstruct the input image, RADAR directly produces anomaly maps from the\ndiffusion model, improving both detection accuracy and computational\nefficiency. We evaluate RADAR on real-world 3D-printed material and the\nMVTec-AD dataset. Our approach surpasses state-of-the-art diffusion-based and\nstatistical machine learning models across all key metrics, including accuracy,\nprecision, recall, and F1 score. Specifically, RADAR improves F1 score by 7% on\nMVTec-AD and 13% on the 3D-printed material dataset compared to the next best\nmodel.\n  Code available at: https://github.com/mehrdadmoradi124/RADAR", "AI": {"tldr": "RADAR\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u65f6\u65e0\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u91cd\u5efa\u6548\u679c\u5dee\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u6c34\u5e73\u9009\u62e9\u56f0\u96be\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "RADAR\u76f4\u63a5\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u5f02\u5e38\u56fe\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u91cd\u5efa\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728MVTec-AD\u548c3D\u6253\u5370\u6750\u6599\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cRADAR\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3001\u7cbe\u786e\u7387\u3001\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u548cF1\u5206\u6570\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cF1\u5206\u6570\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u5347\u4e867%\u548c13%\u3002", "conclusion": "RADAR\u901a\u8fc7\u65e0\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u65f6\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

While the Deep Deterministic Policy\nGradient (DDPG) algorithm excels in control tasks, its performance in maze\nnavigation suffers from sparse rewards, inefficient exploration, and\nlong-horizon planning difficulties, often leading to low success rates and\naverage rewards, sometimes even failing to achieve effective navigation. To\naddress these limitations, this paper proposes an efficient Hierarchical DDPG\n(HDDPG) algorithm, which includes high-level and low-level policies. The\nhigh-level policy employs an advanced DDPG framework to generate intermediate\nsubgoals from a long-term perspective and on a higher temporal scale. The\nlow-level policy, also powered by the improved DDPG algorithm, generates\nprimitive actions by observing current states and following the subgoal\nassigned by the high-level policy. The proposed method enhances stability with\noff-policy correction, refining subgoal assignments by relabeling historical\nexperiences. Additionally, adaptive parameter space noise is utilized to\nimprove exploration, and a reshaped intrinsic-extrinsic reward function is\nemployed to boost learning efficiency. Further optimizations, including\ngradient clipping and Xavier initialization, are employed to improve\nrobustness. The proposed algorithm is rigorously evaluated through numerical\nsimulation experiments executed using the Robot Operating System (ROS) and\nGazebo. Regarding the three distinct final targets in autonomous maze\nnavigation tasks, HDDPG significantly overcomes the limitations of standard\nDDPG and its variants, improving the success rate by at least 56.59% and\nboosting the average reward by a minimum of 519.03 compared to baseline\nalgorithms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u5316DDPG\uff08HDDPG\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u5c42\u548c\u4f4e\u5c42\u7b56\u7565\u89e3\u51b3\u8ff7\u5bab\u5bfc\u822a\u4e2d\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u548c\u63a2\u7d22\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6210\u529f\u7387\u548c\u5e73\u5747\u5956\u52b1\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6DDPG\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u8ff7\u5bab\u5bfc\u822a\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u3001\u63a2\u7d22\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u548c\u957f\u65f6\u89c4\u5212\u56f0\u96be\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4f4e\u548c\u5956\u52b1\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "HDDPG\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u9ad8\u5c42\u7b56\u7565\u751f\u6210\u957f\u671f\u5b50\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u4f4e\u5c42\u7b56\u7565\u6267\u884c\u5177\u4f53\u52a8\u4f5c\u3002\u7ed3\u5408\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u6821\u6b63\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u53c2\u6570\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u5728ROS\u548cGazebo\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cHDDPG\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u81f3\u5c1156.59%\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u5956\u52b1\u63d0\u9ad8\u81f3\u5c11519.03\u3002", "conclusion": "HDDPG\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86DDPG\u5728\u8ff7\u5bab\u5bfc\u822a\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5bfc\u822a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

Considering the\nlack of granularity of initial prototypes, we introduce a hierarchical\nprototype disambiguation mechanism to refine ambiguous prototypes, which\ncorrespond to annotations of different classes. To further enrich contextual\nawareness, we employ a dense conditional random field (CRF) upon the refined\nprototypes to optimize their label assignments. Through iterative human\nfeedback, HOW-Seg dynamically improves its predictions, achieving high-quality\nsegmentation for both base and novel classes. Experiments demonstrate that with\nsparse annotations (e.g., one-novel-class-one-click), HOW-Seg matches or\nsurpasses the state-of-the-art generalized few-shot segmentation (GFS-Seg)\nmethod under the 5-shot setting.

Weakly\nSupervised DSGG (WS-DSGG) reduces annotation workload by using an unlocalized\nscene graph from a single frame per video for training. Existing WS-DSGG\nmethods depend on an off-the-shelf external object detector to generate pseudo\nlabels for subsequent DSGG training. However, detectors trained on static,\nobject-centric images struggle in dynamic, relation-aware scenarios required\nfor DSGG, leading to inaccurate localization and low-confidence proposals.

However, existing\nvideo-based ReID methods often overlook the necessity of identifying and\nselecting the most discriminative features from both videos in a query-gallery\npair for effective matching. To address this issue, we propose a novel\nHierarchical and Adaptive Mixture of Biometric Experts (HAMoBE) framework,\nwhich leverages multi-layer features from a pre-trained large model (e.g.,\nCLIP) and is designed to mimic human perceptual mechanisms by independently\nmodeling key biometric features--appearance, static body shape, and dynamic\ngait--and adaptively integrating them.

For incremental tasks, we propose a Margin\nPenalty-based Classifier Calibration (MPCC) strategy to refine decision\nboundaries by fine-tuning classifiers on all seen classes' embeddings with a\nmargin penalty.

This task is realized by representing the\nimage as a continuous implicit function through two fundamental modules, a\ndeep-network-based encoder and an implicit neural representation (INR) module.\nDespite achieving notable progress, a crucial challenge of such a highly\nill-posed setting is that many common geometric patterns, such as repetitive\ntextures, edges, or shapes, are seriously warped and deformed in the\nlow-resolution images, naturally leading to unexpected artifacts appearing in\ntheir high-resolution recoveries. Embedding rotation equivariance into the\nASISR network is thus necessary, as it has been widely demonstrated that this\nenhancement enables the recovery to faithfully maintain the original\norientations and structural integrity of geometric patterns underlying the\ninput image. Motivated by this, we make efforts to construct a rotation\nequivariant ASISR method in this study. Specifically, we elaborately redesign\nthe basic architectures of INR and encoder modules, incorporating intrinsic\nrotation equivariance capabilities beyond those of conventional ASISR networks.\nThrough such amelioration, the ASISR network can, for the first time, be\nimplemented with end-to-end rotational equivariance maintained from input to\noutput. We also provide a solid theoretical analysis to evaluate its intrinsic\nequivariance error, demonstrating its inherent nature of embedding such an\nequivariance structure.

To address these challenges, we propose EndoMatcher, a\ngeneralizable endoscopic image matcher via large-scale, multi-domain data\npre-training. To address difficult visual conditions, EndoMatcher employs a\ntwo-branch Vision Transformer to extract multi-scale features, enhanced by dual\ninteraction blocks for robust correspondence learning.

To address these issues, this paper proposes\nSGDFuse, a conditional diffusion model guided by the Segment Anything Model\n(SAM), to achieve high-fidelity and semantically-aware image fusion. The core\nof our method is to utilize high-quality semantic masks generated by SAM as\nexplicit priors to guide the optimization of the fusion process via a\nconditional diffusion model. Specifically, the framework operates in a\ntwo-stage process: it first performs a preliminary fusion of multi-modal\nfeatures, and then utilizes the semantic masks from SAM jointly with the\npreliminary fused image as a condition to drive the diffusion model's\ncoarse-to-fine denoising generation.

Despite the remarkable progress of\ndeep learning in recent years, most existing methods still rely on\nspatial-domain modeling, where the limited diversity of feature representations\nhinders the detection of subtle change regions. We observe that\nfrequency-domain feature modeling particularly in the wavelet domain an amplify\nfine-grained differences in frequency components, enhancing the perception of\nedge changes that are challenging to capture in the spatial domain. Thus, we\npropose a method called Wavelet-Guided Dual-Frequency Encoding (WGDF).\nSpecifically, we first apply Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) to decompose the\ninput images into high-frequency and low-frequency components, which are used\nto model local details and global structures, respectively. In the\nhigh-frequency branch, we design a Dual-Frequency Feature Enhancement (DFFE)\nmodule to strengthen edge detail representation and introduce a\nFrequency-Domain Interactive Difference (FDID) module to enhance the modeling\nof fine-grained changes. In the low-frequency branch, we exploit Transformers\nto capture global semantic relationships and employ a Progressive Contextual\nDifference Module (PCDM) to progressively refine change regions, enabling\nprecise structural semantic characterization. Finally, the high- and\nlow-frequency features are synergistically fused to unify local sensitivity\nwith global discriminability. Extensive experiments on multiple remote sensing\ndatasets demonstrate that WGDF significantly alleviates edge ambiguity and\nachieves superior detection accuracy and robustness compared to\nstate-of-the-art methods.

A critical yet\nunderexplored aspect of this task is the effective use of patient-specific\nprior knowledge -- including clinical context (e.g., symptoms, medical history)\nand the most recent prior image -- which radiologists routinely rely on for\ndiagnostic reasoning. Most existing methods generate reports from single\nimages, neglecting this essential prior information and thus failing to capture\ndiagnostic intent or disease progression. To bridge this gap, we propose\nPriorRG, a novel chest X-ray report generation framework that emulates\nreal-world clinical workflows via a two-stage training pipeline. In Stage 1, we\nintroduce a prior-guided contrastive pre-training scheme that leverages\nclinical context to guide spatiotemporal feature extraction, allowing the model\nto align more closely with the intrinsic spatiotemporal semantics in radiology\nreports. In Stage 2, we present a prior-aware coarse-to-fine decoding for\nreport generation that progressively integrates patient-specific prior\nknowledge with the vision encoder's hidden states.

However, most CVL methods\noutput only a single observation, the camera pose, and lack the redundant\nobservations required by surveying principles, making it challenging to assess\nlocalization reliability through the mutual validation of observational data.\nTo tackle this, we introduce Slice-Loc, a two-stage method featuring an\na-contrario reliability validation for CVL. Instead of using the query image as\na single input, Slice-Loc divides it into sub-images and estimates the 3-DoF\npose for each slice, creating redundant and independent observations. Then, a\ngeometric rigidity formula is proposed to filter out the erroneous 3-DoF poses,\nand the inliers are merged to generate the final camera pose. Furthermore, we\npropose a model that quantifies the meaningfulness of localization by\nestimating the number of false alarms (NFA), according to the distribution of\nthe locations of the sliced images. By eliminating gross errors, Slice-Loc\nboosts localization accuracy and effectively detects failures.

To mitigate class imbalance, we\napply data augmentation techniques that simulate the presence of surgical\ninstruments in the training data. One major challenge in pituitary anatomy\nsegmentation is the inconsistency in feature representation due to occlusions,\ncamera motion, and surgical bleeding. By incorporating a Feature Fusion module,\nF2PASeg is proposed to refine anatomical structure segmentation by leveraging\nboth high-resolution image features and deep semantic embeddings, enhancing\nrobustness against intraoperative variations. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat F2PASeg consistently segments critical anatomical structures in real time,\nproviding a reliable solution for intraoperative pituitary surgery planning.\nCode: https://github.com/paulili08/F2PASeg.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5782\u4f53\u89e3\u5256\u5206\u5272\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08PAS\uff09\u548cF2PASeg\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u65f6\u5206\u5272\u5173\u952e\u89e3\u5256\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5782\u4f53\u624b\u672f\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5782\u4f53\u80bf\u7624\u5e38\u5bfc\u81f4\u5468\u56f4\u91cd\u8981\u7ed3\u6784\u53d8\u5f62\u6216\u5305\u88f9\uff0c\u89e3\u5256\u7ed3\u6784\u5206\u5272\u53ef\u4e3a\u5916\u79d1\u533b\u751f\u63d0\u4f9b\u98ce\u9669\u533a\u57df\u9884\u8b66\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaPAS\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff087,845\u5f20\u56fe\u50cf\uff09\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u6280\u672f\u7f13\u89e3\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u63d0\u51faF2PASeg\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u8bed\u4e49\u5d4c\u5165\u3002", "result": "F2PASeg\u80fd\u5b9e\u65f6\u7a33\u5b9a\u5206\u5272\u5173\u952e\u89e3\u5256\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u9002\u5e94\u672f\u4e2d\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "F2PASeg\u4e3a\u5782\u4f53\u624b\u672f\u89c4\u5212\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Considering the ubiquity of chirality information in\ndifferent shape analysis problems and the lack of chirality-aware features\nwithin current shape descriptors, developing a chirality feature extractor\nbecomes necessary and urgent. Based on the recent Diff3F framework, we propose\nan unsupervised chirality feature extraction pipeline to decorate shape\nvertices with chirality-aware information, extracted from 2D foundation models.\nWe evaluated the extracted chirality features through quantitative and\nqualitative experiments across diverse datasets. Results from downstream tasks\nincluding left-right disentanglement, shape matching, and part segmentation\ndemonstrate their effectiveness and practical utility.

However, extending CoT to vision-language reasoning tasks remains\nchallenging, as it often requires interpreting transitions of visual states to\nsupport reasoning. Existing methods often struggle with this due to limited\ncapacity of modeling visual state transitions or incoherent visual trajectories\ncaused by fragmented architectures.\n  To overcome these limitations, we propose Uni-CoT, a Unified Chain-of-Thought\nframework that enables coherent and grounded multimodal reasoning within a\nsingle unified model. The key idea is to leverage a model capable of both image\nunderstanding and generation to reason over visual content and model evolving\nvisual states. However, empowering a unified model to achieve that is\nnon-trivial, given the high computational cost and the burden of training. To\naddress this, Uni-CoT introduces a novel two-level reasoning paradigm: A\nMacro-Level CoT for high-level task planning and A Micro-Level CoT for subtask\nexecution. This design significantly reduces the computational overhead.\nFurthermore, we introduce a structured training paradigm that combines\ninterleaved image-text supervision for macro-level CoT with multi-task\nobjectives for micro-level CoT. Together, these innovations allow Uni-CoT to\nperform scalable and coherent multi-modal reasoning. Furthermore, thanks to our\ndesign, all experiments can be efficiently completed using only 8 A100 GPUs\nwith 80GB VRAM each. Experimental results on reasoning-driven image generation\nbenchmark (WISE) and editing benchmarks (RISE and KRIS) indicates that Uni-CoT\ndemonstrates SOTA performance and strong generalization, establishing Uni-CoT\nas a promising solution for multi-modal reasoning.

Recent studies have\nexplored how to convert the colored points into Gaussians, but directly\ngenerating Gaussians from colorless 3D point clouds remains an unsolved\nchallenge. In this paper, we propose GAP, a novel approach that gaussianizes\nraw point clouds into high-fidelity 3D Gaussians with text guidance. Our key\nidea is to design a multi-view optimization framework that leverages a\ndepth-aware image diffusion model to synthesize consistent appearances across\ndifferent viewpoints. To ensure geometric accuracy, we introduce a\nsurface-anchoring mechanism that effectively constrains Gaussians to lie on the\nsurfaces of 3D shapes during optimization. Furthermore, GAP incorporates a\ndiffuse-based inpainting strategy that specifically targets at completing\nhard-to-observe regions. We evaluate GAP on the Point-to-Gaussian generation\ntask across varying complexity levels, from synthetic point clouds to\nchallenging real-world scans, and even large-scale scenes.

Existing face anonymization methods typically focus on\nobscuring identity but fail to meet the requirements of biometric template\nprotection, including revocability, unlinkability, and irreversibility. We\npropose FaceAnonyMixer, a cancelable face generation framework that leverages\nthe latent space of a pre-trained generative model to synthesize\nprivacy-preserving face images. The core idea of FaceAnonyMixer is to\nirreversibly mix the latent code of a real face image with a synthetic code\nderived from a revocable key. The mixed latent code is further refined through\na carefully designed multi-objective loss to satisfy all cancelable biometric\nrequirements. FaceAnonyMixer is capable of generating high-quality cancelable\nfaces that can be directly matched using existing FR systems without requiring\nany modifications. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that\nFaceAnonyMixer delivers superior recognition accuracy while providing\nsignificantly stronger privacy protection, achieving over an 11% gain on\ncommercial API compared to recent cancelable biometric methods.
