### [1] [HOLODECK 2.0: Vision-Language-Guided 3D World Generation with Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05899)
*Zixuan Bian,Ruohan Ren,Yue Yang,Chris Callison-Burch*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HOLODECK 2.0是一个基于视觉语言模型的3D场景生成框架，支持通过文本生成多样化的3D场景，并允许基于人类反馈的交互式编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D场景生成依赖大量人工，现有自动化方法难以生成开放域场景或支持灵活编辑，因此需要一种直接从文本生成3D场景的解决方案。

Method: HOLODECK 2.0利用视觉语言模型解析场景需求，结合先进的3D生成模型生成高质量资产，并通过空间约束实现语义一致和物理合理的布局。

Result: 实验表明，HOLODECK 2.0生成的场景在语义和视觉质量上优于基线方法，并支持灵活的编辑功能。

Conclusion: HOLODECK 2.0为3D场景生成提供了高效且灵活的解决方案，尤其在游戏建模中具有潜在应用价值。

Abstract: 3D scene generation plays a crucial role in gaming, artistic creation,
virtual reality and many other domains. However, current 3D scene design still
relies heavily on extensive manual effort from creators, and existing automated
methods struggle to generate open-domain scenes or support flexible editing. As
a result, generating 3D worlds directly from text has garnered increasing
attention. In this paper, we introduce HOLODECK 2.0, an advanced
vision-language-guided framework for 3D world generation with support for
interactive scene editing based on human feedback. HOLODECK 2.0 can generate
diverse and stylistically rich 3D scenes (e.g., realistic, cartoon, anime, and
cyberpunk styles) that exhibit high semantic fidelity to fine-grained input
descriptions, suitable for both indoor and open-domain environments. HOLODECK
2.0 leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to identify and parse the objects
required in a scene and generates corresponding high-quality assets via
state-of-the-art 3D generative models. It then iteratively applies spatial
constraints derived from the VLMs to achieve semantically coherent and
physically plausible layouts. Human evaluations and CLIP-based assessments
demonstrate that HOLODECK 2.0 effectively generates high-quality scenes closely
aligned with detailed textual descriptions, consistently outperforming
baselines across indoor and open-domain scenarios. Additionally, we provide
editing capabilities that flexibly adapt to human feedback, supporting layout
refinement and style-consistent object edits. Finally, we present a practical
application of HOLODECK 2.0 in procedural game modeling, generating visually
rich and immersive environments, potentially boosting efficiency.

### [2] [LV-Net: Anatomy-aware lateral ventricle shape modeling with a case study on Alzheimer's disease, the Australian Imaging Biomarkers and Lifestyle flagship study of ageing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06055)
*Wonjung Park,Suhyun Ahn,Jinah Park*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LV-Net是一种新型框架，通过变形联合LV-海马模板网格从脑MRI生成个性化3D LV网格，提高了重建精度和形状统计的准确性，并在阿尔茨海默病分析中识别出与疾病显著相关的LV子区域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 侧脑室（LV）形状分析作为神经系统疾病的生物标志物具有潜力，但由于个体间形状差异大和MRI分辨率限制导致的分割困难，仍存在挑战。

Method: LV-Net通过变形一个解剖学感知的联合LV-海马模板网格，利用其嵌入的解剖关系减少分割伪影并提高重建鲁棒性。同时，基于模板网格顶点的解剖邻接性分类，增强跨受试者的点对应性。

Result: LV-Net在存在分割缺陷的情况下仍实现更高的重建精度，并在不同数据集中提供更可靠的形状描述符。应用于阿尔茨海默病分析时，识别出与疾病显著相关的LV子区域。

Conclusion: LV-Net为LV形状分析提供了更准确和可靠的工具，尤其在神经系统疾病研究中具有潜在应用价值。

Abstract: Lateral ventricle (LV) shape analysis holds promise as a biomarker for
neurological diseases; however, challenges remain due to substantial shape
variability across individuals and segmentation difficulties arising from
limited MRI resolution. We introduce LV-Net, a novel framework for producing
individualized 3D LV meshes from brain MRI by deforming an anatomy-aware joint
LV-hippocampus template mesh. By incorporating anatomical relationships
embedded within the joint template, LV-Net reduces boundary segmentation
artifacts and improves reconstruction robustness. In addition, by classifying
the vertices of the template mesh based on their anatomical adjacency, our
method enhances point correspondence across subjects, leading to more accurate
LV shape statistics. We demonstrate that LV-Net achieves superior
reconstruction accuracy, even in the presence of segmentation imperfections,
and delivers more reliable shape descriptors across diverse datasets. Finally,
we apply LV-Net to Alzheimer's disease analysis, identifying LV subregions that
show significantly associations with the disease relative to cognitively normal
controls. The codes for LV shape modeling are available at
https://github.com/PWonjung/LV_Shape_Modeling.

### [3] [Boosting Adversarial Transferability via Residual Perturbation Attack](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05689)
*Jinjia Peng,Zeze Tao,Huibing Wang,Meng Wang,Yang Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为ResPA的新型攻击方法，通过残差梯度作为扰动方向，提升对抗样本的迁移性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有迁移攻击方法忽略了扰动方向的影响，导致迁移性受限。

Method: ResPA利用残差梯度作为扰动方向，结合历史梯度的参考梯度，捕捉全局扰动方向变化。

Result: 实验表明ResPA的迁移性优于现有方法，且与输入变换方法结合后效果更佳。

Conclusion: ResPA通过优化扰动方向，显著提升了对抗样本的迁移性。

Abstract: Deep neural networks are susceptible to adversarial examples while suffering
from incorrect predictions via imperceptible perturbations. Transfer-based
attacks create adversarial examples for surrogate models and transfer these
examples to target models under black-box scenarios. Recent studies reveal that
adversarial examples in flat loss landscapes exhibit superior transferability
to alleviate overfitting on surrogate models. However, the prior arts overlook
the influence of perturbation directions, resulting in limited transferability.
In this paper, we propose a novel attack method, named Residual Perturbation
Attack (ResPA), relying on the residual gradient as the perturbation direction
to guide the adversarial examples toward the flat regions of the loss function.
Specifically, ResPA conducts an exponential moving average on the input
gradients to obtain the first moment as the reference gradient, which
encompasses the direction of historical gradients. Instead of heavily relying
on the local flatness that stems from the current gradients as the perturbation
direction, ResPA further considers the residual between the current gradient
and the reference gradient to capture the changes in the global perturbation
direction. The experimental results demonstrate the better transferability of
ResPA than the existing typical transfer-based attack methods, while the
transferability can be further improved by combining ResPA with the current
input transformation methods. The code is available at
https://github.com/ZezeTao/ResPA.

### [4] [Generalized Few-Shot Out-of-Distribution Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05732)
*Pinxuan Li,Bing Cao,Changqing Zhang,Qinghua Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种广义少样本OOD检测框架（GOOD），通过引入通用知识模型（GKM）和知识动态嵌入（KDE）机制，提升模型在开放世界中的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有少样本OOD检测方法因训练数据有限，泛化能力不足，导致性能不稳定。

Method: 提出GOOD框架，利用GKM增强通用知识，并通过KDE机制动态调整通用知识指导，实现泛化与特定性的平衡。

Result: 在真实OOD基准测试中表现优越，理论分析表明GS平衡降低了泛化误差上界。

Conclusion: GOOD框架通过通用知识与动态嵌入机制，显著提升了少样本OOD检测的泛化性能。

Abstract: Few-shot Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection has emerged as a critical
research direction in machine learning for practical deployment. Most existing
Few-shot OOD detection methods suffer from insufficient generalization
capability for the open world. Due to the few-shot learning paradigm, the OOD
detection ability is often overfit to the limited training data itself, thus
degrading the performance on generalized data and performing inconsistently
across different scenarios. To address this challenge, we proposed a
Generalized Few-shot OOD Detection (GOOD) framework, which empowers the general
knowledge of the OOD detection model with an auxiliary General Knowledge Model
(GKM), instead of directly learning from few-shot data. We proceed to reveal
the few-shot OOD detection from a generalization perspective and theoretically
derive the Generality-Specificity balance (GS-balance) for OOD detection, which
provably reduces the upper bound of generalization error with a general
knowledge model. Accordingly, we propose a Knowledge Dynamic Embedding (KDE)
mechanism to adaptively modulate the guidance of general knowledge. KDE
dynamically aligns the output distributions of the OOD detection model to the
general knowledge model based on the Generalized Belief (G-Belief) of GKM,
thereby boosting the GS-balance. Experiments on real-world OOD benchmarks
demonstrate our superiority. Codes will be available.

### [5] [UnGuide: Learning to Forget with LoRA-Guided Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05755)
*Agnieszka Polowczyk,Alicja Polowczyk,Dawid Malarz,Artur Kasymov,Marcin Mazur,Jacek Tabor,Przemysław Spurek*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UnGuide是一种新型方法，通过动态推理机制UnGuidance，结合LoRA适配器，实现了对扩散模型中特定知识的精确遗忘，同时保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模文本到图像扩散模型可能被滥用生成有害或误导性内容，因此需要有效的机器遗忘方法，以在不影响整体性能的情况下移除特定知识。

Method: UnGuide结合了LoRA适配器和动态推理机制UnGuidance，通过调整引导尺度，选择性控制遗忘过程。

Result: UnGuide在概念移除任务中表现优于现有LoRA方法，同时保持了图像的真实性和模型的表达能力。

Conclusion: UnGuide提供了一种高效且精确的机器遗忘解决方案，适用于扩散模型中的知识移除任务。

Abstract: Recent advances in large-scale text-to-image diffusion models have heightened
concerns about their potential misuse, especially in generating harmful or
misleading content. This underscores the urgent need for effective machine
unlearning, i.e., removing specific knowledge or concepts from pretrained
models without compromising overall performance. One possible approach is
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), which offers an efficient means to fine-tune models
for targeted unlearning. However, LoRA often inadvertently alters unrelated
content, leading to diminished image fidelity and realism. To address this
limitation, we introduce UnGuide -- a novel approach which incorporates
UnGuidance, a dynamic inference mechanism that leverages Classifier-Free
Guidance (CFG) to exert precise control over the unlearning process. UnGuide
modulates the guidance scale based on the stability of a few first steps of
denoising processes, enabling selective unlearning by LoRA adapter. For prompts
containing the erased concept, the LoRA module predominates and is
counterbalanced by the base model; for unrelated prompts, the base model
governs generation, preserving content fidelity. Empirical results demonstrate
that UnGuide achieves controlled concept removal and retains the expressive
power of diffusion models, outperforming existing LoRA-based methods in both
object erasure and explicit content removal tasks.

### [6] [Improving Masked Style Transfer using Blended Partial Convolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05769)
*Seyed Hadi Seyed,Ayberk Cansever,David Hart*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于部分卷积的风格迁移网络，专注于对图像特定区域进行风格迁移，避免了传统方法中风格特征捕捉不准确的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法对整个图像进行风格迁移，而用户可能仅需对特定区域应用风格，现有方法在区域选择后掩码处理会导致风格特征捕捉不准确。

Method: 采用部分卷积风格迁移网络，并结合网络内部混合技术以处理区域选择中的不完美问题。

Result: 在SA-1B数据集上验证了该方法在视觉和定量上的改进效果。

Conclusion: 该方法能够更准确地针对感兴趣区域进行风格迁移，并公开了代码。

Abstract: Artistic style transfer has long been possible with the advancements of
convolution- and transformer-based neural networks. Most algorithms apply the
artistic style transfer to the whole image, but individual users may only need
to apply a style transfer to a specific region in the image. The standard
practice is to simply mask the image after the stylization. This work shows
that this approach tends to improperly capture the style features in the region
of interest. We propose a partial-convolution-based style transfer network that
accurately applies the style features exclusively to the region of interest.
Additionally, we present network-internal blending techniques that account for
imperfections in the region selection. We show that this visually and
quantitatively improves stylization using examples from the SA-1B dataset. Code
is publicly available at https://github.com/davidmhart/StyleTransferMasked.

### [7] [MAISI-v2: Accelerated 3D High-Resolution Medical Image Synthesis with Rectified Flow and Region-specific Contrastive Loss](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05772)
*Can Zhao,Pengfei Guo,Dong Yang,Yucheng Tang,Yufan He,Benjamin Simon,Mason Belue,Stephanie Harmon,Baris Turkbey,Daguang Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAISI-v2是一个加速的3D医学图像合成框架，通过整合rectified flow实现快速高质量生成，并引入区域特异性对比损失提升条件一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有扩散模型在医学图像合成中的局限性，包括泛化性差、推理速度慢和输入条件对齐弱的问题。

Method: 整合rectified flow加速生成，引入区域特异性对比损失增强条件一致性。

Result: MAISI-v2实现了33倍加速的潜在扩散模型，并达到SOTA图像质量，下游分割实验验证了合成图像的数据增强效果。

Conclusion: MAISI-v2在速度和条件一致性上显著改进，为医学图像合成提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Medical image synthesis is an important topic for both clinical and research
applications. Recently, diffusion models have become a leading approach in this
area. Despite their strengths, many existing methods struggle with (1) limited
generalizability that only work for specific body regions or voxel spacings,
(2) slow inference, which is a common issue for diffusion models, and (3) weak
alignment with input conditions, which is a critical issue for medical imaging.
MAISI, a previously proposed framework, addresses generalizability issues but
still suffers from slow inference and limited condition consistency. In this
work, we present MAISI-v2, the first accelerated 3D medical image synthesis
framework that integrates rectified flow to enable fast and high quality
generation. To further enhance condition fidelity, we introduce a novel
region-specific contrastive loss to enhance the sensitivity to region of
interest. Our experiments show that MAISI-v2 can achieve SOTA image quality
with $33 \times$ acceleration for latent diffusion model. We also conducted a
downstream segmentation experiment to show that the synthetic images can be
used for data augmentation. We release our code, training details, model
weights, and a GUI demo to facilitate reproducibility and promote further
development within the community.

*Mengyu Li,Guoyao Shen,Chad W. Farris,Xin Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于预训练MRI变换器的少样本部署框架，结合MAE预训练策略和混合架构，在数据有限条件下实现高效、稳定的医学影像任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医学影像中标注数据稀缺问题，提升预训练模型在真实场景中的适用性。

Method: 使用MAE预训练策略在大规模MRI数据集上学习可迁移表示，结合轻量级线性头或混合架构（MAE-FUnet）完成分类和分割任务。

Result: 在MRI序列识别和分割任务中达到SOTA性能，尤其在数据有限条件下表现优异。

Conclusion: 该框架高效、稳定且可扩展，适用于低资源临床环境和神经影像应用。

Abstract: Machine learning using transformers has shown great potential in medical
imaging, but its real-world applicability remains limited due to the scarcity
of annotated data. In this study, we propose a practical framework for the
few-shot deployment of pretrained MRI transformers in diverse brain imaging
tasks. By utilizing the Masked Autoencoder (MAE) pretraining strategy on a
large-scale, multi-cohort brain MRI dataset comprising over 31 million slices,
we obtain highly transferable latent representations that generalize well
across tasks and datasets. For high-level tasks such as classification, a
frozen MAE encoder combined with a lightweight linear head achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy in MRI sequence identification with minimal
supervision. For low-level tasks such as segmentation, we propose MAE-FUnet, a
hybrid architecture that fuses multiscale CNN features with pretrained MAE
embeddings. This model consistently outperforms other strong baselines in both
skull stripping and multi-class anatomical segmentation under data-limited
conditions. With extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations, our
framework demonstrates efficiency, stability, and scalability, suggesting its
suitability for low-resource clinical environments and broader neuroimaging
applications.

### [9] [Optimization-Free Style Transfer for 3D Gaussian Splats](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05813)
*Raphael Du Sablon,David Hart*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需重建或优化的3D高斯样条风格迁移方法，通过生成样条表示的隐式表面图结构实现快速风格化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要重建或优化样条，或训练特征提取网络，效率较低。

Method: 生成样条隐式表面图结构，使用前馈表面风格化方法并插值回样条。

Result: 无需额外训练或优化，支持任意风格图像和样条，速度快（2分钟内）。

Conclusion: 方法高效且质量高，代码开源。

Abstract: The task of style transfer for 3D Gaussian splats has been explored in many
previous works, but these require reconstructing or fine-tuning the splat while
incorporating style information or optimizing a feature extraction network on
the splat representation. We propose a reconstruction- and optimization-free
approach to stylizing 3D Gaussian splats. This is done by generating a graph
structure across the implicit surface of the splat representation. A
feed-forward, surface-based stylization method is then used and interpolated
back to the individual splats in the scene. This allows for any style image and
3D Gaussian splat to be used without any additional training or optimization.
This also allows for fast stylization of splats, achieving speeds under 2
minutes even on consumer-grade hardware. We demonstrate the quality results
this approach achieves and compare to other 3D Gaussian splat style transfer
methods. Code is publicly available at
https://github.com/davidmhart/FastSplatStyler.

### [10] [MZEN: Multi-Zoom Enhanced NeRF for 3-D Reconstruction with Unknown Camera Poses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05819)
*Jong-Ik Park,Carlee Joe-Wong,Gary K. Fedder*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MZEN是一种改进的NeRF框架，专门处理多缩放图像集，解决了工业检测中细节缺失的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NeRF方法在多视角2D图像重建3D场景中表现优异，但在工业检测中无法捕捉微米级细节。MZEN旨在解决这一问题。

Method: MZEN通过引入可学习的缩放标量改进相机模型，并提出新的姿态策略：先解决广角图像，再通过缩放一致的裁剪匹配处理缩放图像。

Result: 在多个场景中，MZEN显著优于基线方法，PSNR提升28%，SSIM提升10%，LPIPS降低222%。

Conclusion: MZEN扩展了NeRF在工业检测中的应用，既能保持全局精度，又能捕捉微米级细节。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) methods excel at 3D reconstruction from
multiple 2D images, even those taken with unknown camera poses. However, they
still miss the fine-detailed structures that matter in industrial inspection,
e.g., detecting sub-micron defects on a production line or analyzing chips with
Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). In these scenarios, the sensor resolution
is fixed and compute budgets are tight, so the only way to expose fine
structure is to add zoom-in images; yet, this breaks the multi-view consistency
that pose-free NeRF training relies on. We propose Multi-Zoom Enhanced NeRF
(MZEN), the first NeRF framework that natively handles multi-zoom image sets.
MZEN (i) augments the pin-hole camera model with an explicit, learnable zoom
scalar that scales the focal length, and (ii) introduces a novel pose strategy:
wide-field images are solved first to establish a global metric frame, and
zoom-in images are then pose-primed to the nearest wide-field counterpart via a
zoom-consistent crop-and-match procedure before joint refinement. Across eight
forward-facing scenes$\unicode{x2013}$synthetic TCAD models, real SEM of
micro-structures, and BLEFF objects$\unicode{x2013}$MZEN consistently
outperforms pose-free baselines and even high-resolution variants, boosting
PSNR by up to $28 \%$, SSIM by $10 \%$, and reducing LPIPS by up to $222 \%$.
MZEN, therefore, extends NeRF to real-world factory settings, preserving global
accuracy while capturing the micron-level details essential for industrial
inspection.

### [11] [TSMS-SAM2: Multi-scale Temporal Sampling Augmentation and Memory-Splitting Pruning for Promptable Video Object Segmentation and Tracking in Surgical Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05829)
*Guoping Xu,Hua-Chieh Shao,You Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TSMS-SAM2是一个针对手术视频中可提示视频对象分割与跟踪（VOST）的新框架，通过多时间尺度视频采样增强和内存分割修剪机制，解决了SAM2在复杂运动动态和内存冗余中的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手术视频分析中，复杂运动动态和内存冗余限制了现有模型（如SAM2）的有效性，需要一种更鲁棒和高效的解决方案。

Method: 提出TSMS-SAM2框架，采用多时间尺度视频采样增强和内存分割修剪机制，优化对象分割与跟踪。

Result: 在EndoVis2017和EndoVis2018数据集上分别达到95.24和86.73的Dice分数，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TSMS-SAM2在复杂手术场景中表现出高效和鲁棒的分割能力，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Promptable video object segmentation and tracking (VOST) has seen significant
advances with the emergence of foundation models like Segment Anything Model 2
(SAM2); however, their application in surgical video analysis remains
challenging due to complex motion dynamics and the redundancy of memory that
impedes effective learning. In this work, we propose TSMS-SAM2, a novel
framework that enhances promptable VOST in surgical videos by addressing
challenges of rapid object motion and memory redundancy in SAM2. TSMS-SAM2
introduces two key strategies: multi-temporal-scale video sampling augmentation
to improve robustness against motion variability, and a memory splitting and
pruning mechanism that organizes and filters past frame features for more
efficient and accurate segmentation. Evaluated on EndoVis2017 and EndoVis2018
datasets, TSMS-SAM2 achieved the highest mean Dice scores of 95.24 and 86.73,
respectively, outperforming prior SAM-based and task-specific methods.
Extensive ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of multiscale temporal
augmentation and memory splitting, highlighting the framework's potential for
robust, efficient segmentation in complex surgical scenarios. Our source code
will be available at https://github.com/apple1986/TSMS-SAM2.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为TCA的轻量级策略，通过利用帧间时间一致性优化视频分割中的令牌聚类，显著减少计算成本同时保持细节。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Swin Transformer在视频分割中计算成本高，传统令牌剪枝方法不适用，且现有聚类方法未充分利用时间冗余。

Method: 提出TCA策略，利用时间相关性优化令牌聚类，避免冗余令牌的随机丢弃。

Result: 在多个数据集上验证，TCA显著提升了现有聚类方法的精度与速度平衡。

Conclusion: TCA是一种无需微调的轻量级策略，适用于自然和特定领域视频，优化了视频分割性能。

Abstract: Vision Transformers have substantially advanced the capabilities of
segmentation models across both image and video domains. Among them, the Swin
Transformer stands out for its ability to capture hierarchical, multi-scale
representations, making it a popular backbone for segmentation in videos.
However, despite its window-attention scheme, it still incurs a high
computational cost, especially in larger variants commonly used for dense
prediction in videos. This remains a major bottleneck for real-time,
resource-constrained applications. Whilst token reduction methods have been
proposed to alleviate this, the window-based attention mechanism of Swin
requires a fixed number of tokens per window, limiting the applicability of
conventional pruning techniques. Meanwhile, training-free token clustering
approaches have shown promise in image segmentation while maintaining window
consistency. Nevertheless, they fail to exploit temporal redundancy, missing a
key opportunity to further optimize video segmentation performance. We
introduce Temporal Cluster Assignment (TCA), a lightweight and effective,
fine-tuning-free strategy that enhances token clustering by leveraging temporal
coherence across frames. Instead of indiscriminately dropping redundant tokens,
TCA refines token clusters using temporal correlations, thereby retaining
fine-grained details while significantly reducing computation. Extensive
evaluations on YouTube-VIS 2019, YouTube-VIS 2021, OVIS, and a private surgical
video dataset show that TCA consistently boosts the accuracy-speed trade-off of
existing clustering-based methods. Our results demonstrate that TCA generalizes
competently across both natural and domain-specific videos.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于视觉-语言框架的驾驶员视觉注意力预测方法，通过自然语言描述驾驶场景中的注意力变化，支持少样本和零样本学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注静态图像中的注意力分配，而忽略了动态变化的注意力景观。本文旨在通过自然语言建模驾驶员的视线变化，为自动驾驶和HCI提供更可解释的解决方案。

Method: 利用BDD-A数据集的高质量标注，通过人机反馈优化描述，并微调LLaVA模型，结合低层线索和上下文信息（如路线语义、风险预测），生成基于语言的注意力行为描述。

Result: 微调后的模型在注意力转移检测和可解释性上优于通用视觉语言模型，并在少样本和单样本训练中表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法首次通过自然语言生成驾驶员注意力分配和转移预测，为自动驾驶中的可解释AI提供了新方向，并为下游任务（如行为预测、人机协作）奠定了基础。

Abstract: Driver visual attention prediction is a critical task in autonomous driving
and human-computer interaction (HCI) research. Most prior studies focus on
estimating attention allocation at a single moment in time, typically using
static RGB images such as driving scene pictures. In this work, we propose a
vision-language framework that models the changing landscape of drivers' gaze
through natural language, using few-shot and zero-shot learning on single RGB
images. We curate and refine high-quality captions from the BDD-A dataset using
human-in-the-loop feedback, then fine-tune LLaVA to align visual perception
with attention-centric scene understanding. Our approach integrates both
low-level cues and top-down context (e.g., route semantics, risk anticipation),
enabling language-based descriptions of gaze behavior. We evaluate performance
across training regimes (few shot, and one-shot) and introduce domain-specific
metrics for semantic alignment and response diversity. Results show that our
fine-tuned model outperforms general-purpose VLMs in attention shift detection
and interpretability. To our knowledge, this is among the first attempts to
generate driver visual attention allocation and shifting predictions in natural
language, offering a new direction for explainable AI in autonomous driving.
Our approach provides a foundation for downstream tasks such as behavior
forecasting, human-AI teaming, and multi-agent coordination.

*Qiaomu Miao,Vivek Raju Golani,Jingyi Xu,Progga Paromita Dutta,Minh Hoai,Dimitris Samaras*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种多视角相机方法用于视线目标估计（GTE），通过整合不同视角信息提升准确性和适用性，解决了单视角方法中的人脸遮挡、目标模糊和视野外目标等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有单视角GTE方法存在人脸遮挡、目标模糊和视野外目标等局限性，多视角方法可以显著提升准确性和适用性。

Method: 方法包括头部信息聚合（HIA）模块、基于不确定性的视线选择（UGS）模块和基于极线的场景注意力（ESA）模块，处理双视角输入。

Result: 方法显著优于单视角基线，尤其在第二视角提供清晰人脸视图时；还能仅用第二视角图像估计第一视角的视线目标。

Conclusion: 多视角GTE方法有效解决了单视角的局限性，并引入了多视角数据集供开发和评估。

Abstract: This paper presents a method that utilizes multiple camera views for the gaze
target estimation (GTE) task. The approach integrates information from
different camera views to improve accuracy and expand applicability, addressing
limitations in existing single-view methods that face challenges such as face
occlusion, target ambiguity, and out-of-view targets. Our method processes a
pair of camera views as input, incorporating a Head Information Aggregation
(HIA) module for leveraging head information from both views for more accurate
gaze estimation, an Uncertainty-based Gaze Selection (UGS) for identifying the
most reliable gaze output, and an Epipolar-based Scene Attention (ESA) module
for cross-view background information sharing. This approach significantly
outperforms single-view baselines, especially when the second camera provides a
clear view of the person's face. Additionally, our method can estimate the gaze
target in the first view using the image of the person in the second view only,
a capability not possessed by single-view GTE methods. Furthermore, the paper
introduces a multi-view dataset for developing and evaluating multi-view GTE
methods. Data and code are available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练视觉语言模型（如CLIP）在零样本任务中表现良好，但在分布偏移下泛化能力有限。测试时适应（TTA）旨在解决这一问题，但现有方法存在存储限制和提示依赖的不足。

Method: ETTA引入递归更新模块，动态整合所有测试样本以优化决策边界，并采用自适应集成模块减少提示依赖，结合两者的互补优势。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，ETTA在计算复杂度和准确性上均优于现有TTA模型。

Conclusion: ETTA为高效、有效的测试时适应设定了新标准，代码已开源。

Abstract: Pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP show strong zero-shot
performance but struggle with generalization under distribution shifts.
Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) addresses this by adapting VLMs to unlabeled test
data in new domains. While some TTA methods rely on prompt-tuning,
training-free cache-based approaches are preferred for efficiency. However,
current cache-based TTA models store only a limited set of high-confidence
samples, restricting the decision boundary to these samples and ignoring the
influence of other incoming test data. To address this, we propose Efficient
Test-Time Adaptation (ETTA), introducing a Recursive Updating module that
integrates all incoming test samples, progressively refining the decision
boundary. This strategy mimics an unbounded cache, dynamically updating
contextual embeddings for improved accuracy with minimal memory and
computational overhead. ETTA also includes an Adaptive Ensemble module to
reduce prompt dependency in image-to-text scores by dynamically selecting
optimal prompts for each class. Furthermore, ETTA adaptively combines scores
from both modules based on confidence levels, leveraging their complementary
strengths. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks confirm that ETTA surpasses
the state-of-the-art TTA models in computational complexity and accuracy,
setting a new standard for effective, efficient test-time adaptation. The code
has been released at https://github.com/hamidreza-dastmalchi/ETTA.

*Lang Nie,Yuan Mei,Kang Liao,Yunqiu Xu,Chunyu Lin,Bin Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RopStitch是一种无监督深度图像拼接框架，通过双分支架构和虚拟最优平面概念提升鲁棒性和自然性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决图像拼接中内容对齐与结构保持的矛盾，并提升模型在多样化场景中的泛化能力。

Method: 采用双分支架构分别提取粗粒度与细粒度特征，并通过虚拟最优平面概念优化拼接过程。

Result: 在多个数据集上显著优于现有方法，尤其在场景鲁棒性和内容自然性方面表现突出。

Conclusion: RopStitch通过创新架构和优化策略，实现了高效且自然的图像拼接。

Abstract: We present \textit{RopStitch}, an unsupervised deep image stitching framework
with both robustness and naturalness. To ensure the robustness of
\textit{RopStitch}, we propose to incorporate the universal prior of content
perception into the image stitching model by a dual-branch architecture. It
separately captures coarse and fine features and integrates them to achieve
highly generalizable performance across diverse unseen real-world scenes.
Concretely, the dual-branch model consists of a pretrained branch to capture
semantically invariant representations and a learnable branch to extract
fine-grained discriminative features, which are then merged into a whole by a
controllable factor at the correlation level. Besides, considering that content
alignment and structural preservation are often contradictory to each other, we
propose a concept of virtual optimal planes to relieve this conflict. To this
end, we model this problem as a process of estimating homography decomposition
coefficients, and design an iterative coefficient predictor and minimal
semantic distortion constraint to identify the optimal plane. This scheme is
finally incorporated into \textit{RopStitch} by warping both views onto the
optimal plane bidirectionally. Extensive experiments across various datasets
demonstrate that \textit{RopStitch} significantly outperforms existing methods,
particularly in scene robustness and content naturalness. The code is available
at {\color{red}https://github.com/MmelodYy/RopStitch}.

Conclusion: 神经场模型为移动计算成像提供了高效、自适应的解决方案。

Abstract: Over the past two decades, mobile imaging has experienced a profound
transformation, with cell phones rapidly eclipsing all other forms of digital
photography in popularity. Today's cell phones are equipped with a diverse
range of imaging technologies - laser depth ranging, multi-focal camera arrays,
and split-pixel sensors - alongside non-visual sensors such as gyroscopes,
accelerometers, and magnetometers. This, combined with on-board integrated
chips for image and signal processing, makes the cell phone a versatile
pocket-sized computational imaging platform. Parallel to this, we have seen in
recent years how neural fields - small neural networks trained to map
continuous spatial input coordinates to output signals - enable the
reconstruction of complex scenes without explicit data representations such as
pixel arrays or point clouds. In this thesis, I demonstrate how carefully
designed neural field models can compactly represent complex geometry and
lighting effects. Enabling applications such as depth estimation, layer
separation, and image stitching directly from collected in-the-wild mobile
photography data. These methods outperform state-of-the-art approaches without
relying on complex pre-processing steps, labeled ground truth data, or machine
learning priors. Instead, they leverage well-constructed, self-regularized
models that tackle challenging inverse problems through stochastic gradient
descent, fitting directly to raw measurements from a smartphone.

Abstract: Monitoring construction progress is crucial yet resource-intensive, prompting
the exploration of computer-vision-based methodologies for enhanced efficiency
and scalability. Traditional data acquisition methods, primarily focusing on
indoor environments, falter in construction site's complex, cluttered, and
dynamically changing conditions. This paper critically evaluates the
application of two advanced 3D segmentation methods, Segment Anything Model
(SAM) and Mask3D, in challenging outdoor and indoor conditions. Trained
initially on indoor datasets, both models' adaptability and performance are
assessed in real-world construction settings, highlighting the gap in current
segmentation approaches due to the absence of benchmarks for outdoor scenarios.
Through a comparative analysis, this study not only showcases the relative
effectiveness of SAM and Mask3D but also addresses the critical need for
tailored segmentation workflows capable of extracting actionable insights from
construction site data, thereby advancing the field towards more automated and
precise monitoring techniques.

Conclusion: SINGAD通过自监督优化和几何误差传播，显著提升了单图像法线估计的准确性和一致性。

Abstract: The lack of spatial dimensional information remains a challenge in normal
estimation from a single image. Recent diffusion-based methods have
demonstrated significant potential in 2D-to-3D implicit mapping, they rely on
data-driven statistical priors and miss the explicit modeling of light-surface
interaction, leading to multi-view normal direction conflicts. Moreover, the
discrete sampling mechanism of diffusion models causes gradient discontinuity
in differentiable rendering reconstruction modules, preventing 3D geometric
errors from being backpropagated to the normal generation network, thereby
forcing existing methods to depend on dense normal annotations. This paper
proposes SINGAD, a novel Self-supervised framework from a single Image for
Normal estimation via 3D GAussian splatting guided Diffusion. By integrating
physics-driven light-interaction modeling and a differentiable rendering-based
reprojection strategy, our framework directly converts 3D geometric errors into
normal optimization signals, solving the challenges of multi-view geometric
inconsistency and data dependency. Specifically, the framework constructs a
light-interaction-driven 3DGS reparameterization model to generate multi-scale
geometric features consistent with light transport principles, ensuring
multi-view normal consistency. A cross-domain feature fusion module is designed
within a conditional diffusion model, embedding geometric priors to constrain
normal generation while maintaining accurate geometric error propagation.
Furthermore, a differentiable 3D reprojection loss strategy is introduced for
self-supervised optimization that minimizes geometric error between the
reconstructed and input image, eliminating dependence on annotated normal
datasets. Quantitative evaluations on the Google Scanned Objects dataset
demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across
multiple metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在将视觉合成能力集成到LLM中时，常因训练成本高而受限。Bifrost-1旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 使用patch级CLIP图像嵌入作为潜在变量，轻量级调整ControlNet，并初始化MLLM的视觉生成分支。

Result: Bifrost-1在视觉保真度和多模态理解上表现优异，且训练计算成本显著降低。

Conclusion: 该框架有效整合了MLLM和扩散模型，为高保真图像生成提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: There is growing interest in integrating high-fidelity visual synthesis
capabilities into large language models (LLMs) without compromising their
strong reasoning capabilities. Existing methods that directly train LLMs or
bridge LLMs and diffusion models usually suffer from costly training since the
backbone LLMs have not seen image representations during pretraining. We
present Bifrost-1, a unified framework that bridges pretrained multimodal LLMs
(MLLMs) and diffusion models using patch-level CLIP image embeddings as latent
variables, which are natively aligned with the MLLM's CLIP visual encoder.
These patch-level image embeddings are integrated into the diffusion model with
a lightweight adaptation of its ControlNet. To retain the original multimodal
reasoning capabilities of MLLMs, we equip the MLLM with a visual generation
branch initialized from the original MLLM parameters when predicting the
patch-level image embeddings. By seamlessly integrating pretrained MLLMs and
diffusion models with patch-level CLIP latents, our framework enables
high-fidelity controllable image generation with significant training
efficiency. Our experiments demonstrate that Bifrost-1 achieves comparable or
better performance than previous methods in terms of visual fidelity and
multimodal understanding, with substantially lower compute during training. We
also provide comprehensive ablation studies showing the effectiveness of our
design choices.

Motivation: 解决机器人操作中高级任务语义与低级几何特征之间的割裂问题，并减少对人工标注的依赖。

Result: 在多样化机器人操作任务中表现优异，性能接近人工标注水平。

Conclusion: PASG为机器人操作中几何基元与任务语义的统一提供了新范式。

Abstract: The fragmentation between high-level task semantics and low-level geometric
features remains a persistent challenge in robotic manipulation. While
vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promise in generating affordance-aware
visual representations, the lack of semantic grounding in canonical spaces and
reliance on manual annotations severely limit their ability to capture dynamic
semantic-affordance relationships. To address these, we propose Primitive-Aware
Semantic Grounding (PASG), a closed-loop framework that introduces: (1)
Automatic primitive extraction through geometric feature aggregation, enabling
cross-category detection of keypoints and axes; (2) VLM-driven semantic
anchoring that dynamically couples geometric primitives with functional
affordances and task-relevant description; (3) A spatial-semantic reasoning
benchmark and a fine-tuned VLM (Qwen2.5VL-PA). We demonstrate PASG's
effectiveness in practical robotic manipulation tasks across diverse scenarios,
achieving performance comparable to manual annotations. PASG achieves a
finer-grained semantic-affordance understanding of objects, establishing a
unified paradigm for bridging geometric primitives with task semantics in
robotic manipulation.

Conclusion: AnimateScene通过统一框架解决了3D与4D集成中的关键问题，实现了高质量的动态场景生成。

Abstract: 3D scene reconstruction and 4D human animation have seen rapid progress and
broad adoption in recent years. However, seamlessly integrating reconstructed
scenes with 4D human animation to produce visually engaging results remains
challenging. One key difficulty lies in placing the human at the correct
location and scale within the scene while avoiding unrealistic
interpenetration. Another challenge is that the human and the background may
exhibit different lighting and style, leading to unrealistic composites. In
addition, appealing character motion videos are often accompanied by camera
movements, which means that the viewpoints need to be reconstructed along a
specified trajectory. We present AnimateScene, which addresses the above issues
in a unified framework. First, we design an accurate placement module that
automatically determines a plausible 3D position for the human and prevents any
interpenetration within the scene during motion. Second, we propose a
training-free style alignment method that adapts the 4D human representation to
match the background's lighting and style, achieving coherent visual
integration. Finally, we design a joint post-reconstruction method for both the
4D human and the 3D scene that allows camera trajectories to be inserted,
enabling the final rendered video to feature visually appealing camera
movements. Extensive experiments show that AnimateScene generates dynamic scene
videos with high geometric detail and spatiotemporal coherence across various
camera and action combinations.

Motivation: 深度补全模型在从源数据转移到目标数据时，由于协变量偏移导致预测错误，需要一种无需预先了解目标分布的方法进行适应。

Result: 在三个室内和三个室外数据集上，ETA平均性能分别提升了10.23%和6.94%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ETA通过能量模型实现了测试时的高效适应，显著提升了模型在新环境下的泛化能力。

Abstract: We propose a method for test-time adaptation of pretrained depth completion
models. Depth completion models, trained on some ``source'' data, often predict
erroneous outputs when transferred to ``target'' data captured in novel
environmental conditions due to a covariate shift. The crux of our method lies
in quantifying the likelihood of depth predictions belonging to the source data
distribution. The challenge is in the lack of access to out-of-distribution
(target) data prior to deployment. Hence, rather than making assumptions
regarding the target distribution, we utilize adversarial perturbations as a
mechanism to explore the data space. This enables us to train an energy model
that scores local regions of depth predictions as in- or out-of-distribution.
We update the parameters of pretrained depth completion models at test time to
minimize energy, effectively aligning test-time predictions to those of the
source distribution. We call our method ``Energy-based Test-time Adaptation'',
or ETA for short. We evaluate our method across three indoor and three outdoor
datasets, where ETA improve over the previous state-of-the-art method by an
average of 6.94% for outdoors and 10.23% for indoors. Project Page:

Result: 在多个视频计算机视觉任务中，方法显著加速且性能损失轻微。

Conclusion: 所提系统高效且性能优越，适用于视频计算机视觉任务。

Abstract: The efficiency of video computer vision system remains a challenging task due
to the high temporal redundancy inside a video. Existing works have been
proposed for efficient vision computer vision. However, they do not fully
reduce the temporal redundancy and neglect the front end computation overhead.
In this paper, we propose an efficient video computer vision system. First,
image signal processor is removed and Bayer-format data is directly fed into
video computer vision models, thus saving the front end computation. Second,
instead of optical flow models and video codecs, a fast block matching-based
motion estimation algorithm is proposed specifically for efficient video
computer vision, with a MV refinement module. To correct the error,
context-aware block refinement network is introduced to refine regions with
large error. To further balance the accuracy and efficiency, a frame selection
strategy is employed. Experiments on multiple video computer vision tasks
demonstrate that our method achieves significant acceleration with slight
performance loss.

Conclusion: 提出的框架在多模态情感识别中表现优异，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Emotion recognition plays a vital role in enhancing human-computer
interaction. In this study, we tackle the MER-SEMI challenge of the MER2025
competition by proposing a novel multimodal emotion recognition framework. To
address the issue of data scarcity, we leverage large-scale pre-trained models
to extract informative features from visual, audio, and textual modalities.
Specifically, for the visual modality, we design a dual-branch visual encoder
that captures both global frame-level features and localized facial
representations. For the textual modality, we introduce a context-enriched
method that employs large language models to enrich emotional cues within the
input text. To effectively integrate these multimodal features, we propose a
fusion strategy comprising two key components, i.e., self-attention mechanisms
for dynamic modality weighting, and residual connections to preserve original
representations. Beyond architectural design, we further refine noisy labels in
the training set by a multi-source labeling strategy. Our approach achieves a
substantial performance improvement over the official baseline on the
MER2025-SEMI dataset, attaining a weighted F-score of 87.49% compared to
78.63%, thereby validating the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

Motivation: 现有方法因缺乏结构化配对数据，导致化妆细节粗糙且难以平衡身份与化妆保真度。

Method: 引入MakeupQuad数据集，并提出EvoMakeup框架，通过多阶段蒸馏避免图像退化。

Result: EvoMakeup在真实场景中表现优异，支持高保真、可控的多任务化妆编辑。

Conclusion: 方法在化妆保真度和身份保持上取得平衡，优于现有技术。

Abstract: Facial makeup editing aims to realistically transfer makeup from a reference
to a target face. Existing methods often produce low-quality results with
coarse makeup details and struggle to preserve both identity and makeup
fidelity, mainly due to the lack of structured paired data -- where source and
result share identity, and reference and result share identical makeup. To
address this, we introduce MakeupQuad, a large-scale, high-quality dataset with
non-makeup faces, references, edited results, and textual makeup descriptions.
Building on this, we propose EvoMakeup, a unified training framework that
mitigates image degradation during multi-stage distillation, enabling iterative
improvement of both data and model quality. Although trained solely on
synthetic data, EvoMakeup generalizes well and outperforms prior methods on
real-world benchmarks. It supports high-fidelity, controllable, multi-task
makeup editing -- including full-face and partial reference-based editing, as
well as text-driven makeup editing -- within a single model. Experimental
results demonstrate that our method achieves superior makeup fidelity and
identity preservation, effectively balancing both aspects. Code and dataset
will be released upon acceptance.

Conclusion: MathReal为MLLMs在真实教育场景中的性能评估提供了基准，并指出了未来改进方向。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in visual mathematical reasoning across various existing
benchmarks. However, these benchmarks are predominantly based on clean or
processed multimodal inputs, without incorporating the images provided by
real-world Kindergarten through 12th grade (K-12) educational users. To address
this gap, we introduce MathReal, a meticulously curated dataset comprising
2,000 mathematical questions with images captured by handheld mobile devices in
authentic scenarios. Each question is an image, containing the question text
and visual element. We systematically classify the real images into three
primary categories: image quality degradation, perspective variation, and
irrelevant content interference, which are further delineated into 14
subcategories. Additionally, MathReal spans five core knowledge and ability
categories, which encompass three question types and are divided into three
difficulty levels. To comprehensively evaluate the multimodal mathematical
reasoning abilities of state-of-the-art MLLMs in real-world scenarios, we
design six experimental settings that enable a systematic analysis of their
performance. Through extensive experimentation, we find that the
problem-solving abilities of existing MLLMs are significantly challenged in
realistic educational contexts. Based on this, we conduct a thorough analysis
of their performance and error patterns, providing insights into their
recognition, comprehension, and reasoning capabilities, and outlining
directions for future improvements. Data and code:

TL;DR: GMF-Drive提出了一种基于门控Mamba融合的端到端自动驾驶框架，通过几何增强的LiDAR表示和高效的空间感知状态空间模型（SSM），克服了传统Transformer的局限性，并在NAVSIM基准测试中取得最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散模型的自动驾驶方法依赖Transformer融合，但其二次计算复杂度和缺乏空间先验限制了高分辨率特征的使用和BEV表示的有效建模。

Method: 1. 使用几何增强的LiDAR表示（形状描述符和统计特征）；2. 提出分层门控Mamba融合（GM-Fusion）架构，用高效的空间感知SSM替代Transformer。

Result: 在NAVSIM基准测试中，GMF-Drive显著优于DiffusionDrive，达到新的最优性能。

Conclusion: 任务特定的SSM在自动驾驶中性能和效率上均优于通用Transformer，验证了GMF-Drive的创新有效性。

Abstract: Diffusion-based models are redefining the state-of-the-art in end-to-end
autonomous driving, yet their performance is increasingly hampered by a
reliance on transformer-based fusion. These architectures face fundamental
limitations: quadratic computational complexity restricts the use of
high-resolution features, and a lack of spatial priors prevents them from
effectively modeling the inherent structure of Bird's Eye View (BEV)
representations. This paper introduces GMF-Drive (Gated Mamba Fusion for
Driving), an end-to-end framework that overcomes these challenges through two
principled innovations. First, we supersede the information-limited
histogram-based LiDAR representation with a geometrically-augmented pillar
format encoding shape descriptors and statistical features, preserving critical
3D geometric details. Second, we propose a novel hierarchical gated mamba
fusion (GM-Fusion) architecture that substitutes an expensive transformer with
a highly efficient, spatially-aware state-space model (SSM). Our core BEV-SSM
leverages directional sequencing and adaptive fusion mechanisms to capture
long-range dependencies with linear complexity, while explicitly respecting the
unique spatial properties of the driving scene. Extensive experiments on the
challenging NAVSIM benchmark demonstrate that GMF-Drive achieves a new
state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming DiffusionDrive.
Comprehensive ablation studies validate the efficacy of each component,
demonstrating that task-specific SSMs can surpass a general-purpose transformer
in both performance and efficiency for autonomous driving.

Abstract: Recent advances in novel view synthesis (NVS) have enabled real-time
rendering with 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). However, existing methods struggle
with artifacts and missing regions when rendering from viewpoints that deviate
from the training trajectory, limiting seamless scene exploration. To address
this, we propose a 3DGS-based pipeline that generates additional training views
to enhance reconstruction. We introduce an information-gain-driven virtual
camera placement strategy to maximize scene coverage, followed by video
diffusion priors to refine rendered results. Fine-tuning 3D Gaussians with
these enhanced views significantly improves reconstruction quality. To evaluate

Abstract: Accurate localization represents a fundamental challenge in
  robotic navigation. Traditional methodologies, such as Lidar or QR-code based
systems, suffer from inherent scalability and adaptability con straints,
particularly in complex environments. In this work, we propose
  an innovative localization framework that harnesses flooring characteris tics

  approach successfully addresses the kidnapped robot problem in every
  frame without requiring complex filtering processes. These advancements
  open up new possibilities for robotic navigation in diverse environments.

Abstract: Sub-visible particle analysis using flow imaging microscopy combined with
deep learning has proven effective in identifying particle types, enabling the
distinction of harmless components such as silicone oil from protein particles.
However, the scarcity of available data and severe imbalance between particle
types within datasets remain substantial hurdles when applying multi-class
classifiers to such problems, often forcing researchers to rely on less
effective methods. The aforementioned issue is particularly challenging for
particle types that appear unintentionally and in lower numbers, such as
silicone oil and air bubbles, as opposed to protein particles, where obtaining
large numbers of images through controlled settings is comparatively
straightforward. In this work, we develop a state-of-the-art diffusion model to
address data imbalance by generating high-fidelity images that can augment
training datasets, enabling the effective training of multi-class deep neural
networks. We validate this approach by demonstrating that the generated samples
closely resemble real particle images in terms of visual quality and structure.
To assess the effectiveness of using diffusion-generated images in training
datasets, we conduct large-scale experiments on a validation dataset comprising
500,000 protein particle images and demonstrate that this approach improves
classification performance with no negligible downside. Finally, to promote
open research and reproducibility, we publicly release both our diffusion
models and the trained multi-class deep neural network classifiers, along with
a straightforward interface for easy integration into future studies, at

Motivation: 传统数据增强方法忽略了深度感知变换，限制了模型在真实世界深度变化中的鲁棒性。

Method: Depth-Jitter通过自适应深度偏移和深度方差阈值指导，生成合成深度扰动并保持结构完整性。

Result: 实验表明，Depth-Jitter在深度敏感环境中能稳定提升模型泛化能力，尽管绝对性能不一定优于传统方法。

Conclusion: Depth-Jitter为深度感知增强提供了新思路，支持进一步研究深度相关学习策略。

Abstract: Depth information is essential in computer vision, particularly in underwater
imaging, robotics, and autonomous navigation. However, conventional
augmentation techniques overlook depth aware transformations, limiting model
robustness in real world depth variations. In this paper, we introduce
Depth-Jitter, a novel depth-based augmentation technique that simulates natural
depth variations to improve generalization. Our approach applies adaptive depth
offsetting, guided by depth variance thresholds, to generate synthetic depth
perturbations while preserving structural integrity. We evaluate Depth-Jitter
on two benchmark datasets, FathomNet and UTDAC2020 demonstrating its impact on
model stability under diverse depth conditions. Extensive experiments compare
Depth-Jitter against traditional augmentation strategies such as ColorJitter,
analyzing performance across varying learning rates, encoders, and loss
functions. While Depth-Jitter does not always outperform conventional methods
in absolute performance, it consistently enhances model stability and
generalization in depth-sensitive environments. These findings highlight the
potential of depth-aware augmentation for real-world applications and provide a
foundation for further research into depth-based learning strategies. The
proposed technique is publicly available to support advancements in depth-aware
augmentation. The code is publicly available on

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在人体解析中常使用固定掩码类别，无法区分细粒度的衣物或身体部位。扩散模型的通用表示也不适用于详细的人体解析。

Method: Spectrum利用改进的图像到纹理（I2Tx）扩散模型提取特征，并通过提示引导生成语义有效的掩码。

Result: 实验表明，Spectrum在跨数据集评估中优于基线方法，特别是在提示分割任务中。

Conclusion: Spectrum通过结合扩散模型和纹理生成技术，实现了对人体和衣物的精细解析，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Existing methods for human parsing into body parts and clothing often use
fixed mask categories with broad labels that obscure fine-grained clothing
types. Recent open-vocabulary segmentation approaches leverage pretrained
text-to-image (T2I) diffusion model features for strong zero-shot transfer, but
typically group entire humans into a single person category, failing to
distinguish diverse clothing or detailed body parts. To address this, we
propose Spectrum, a unified network for part-level pixel parsing (body parts
and clothing) and instance-level grouping. While diffusion-based
open-vocabulary models generalize well across tasks, their internal
representations are not specialized for detailed human parsing. We observe
that, unlike diffusion models with broad representations, image-driven 3D
texture generators maintain faithful correspondence to input images, enabling
stronger representations for parsing diverse clothing and body parts. Spectrum
introduces a novel repurposing of an Image-to-Texture (I2Tx) diffusion model --
obtained by fine-tuning a T2I model on 3D human texture maps -- for improved
alignment with body parts and clothing. From an input image, we extract
human-part internal features via the I2Tx diffusion model and generate
semantically valid masks aligned to diverse clothing categories through
prompt-guided grounding. Once trained, Spectrum produces semantic segmentation
maps for every visible body part and clothing category, ignoring standalone
garments or irrelevant objects, for any number of humans in the scene. We
conduct extensive cross-dataset experiments -- separately assessing body parts,
clothing parts, unseen clothing categories, and full-body masks -- and
demonstrate that Spectrum consistently outperforms baseline methods in
prompt-based segmentation.

Result: 在PIE数据集上，InstantEdit在速度和编辑质量上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: InstantEdit通过RectifiedFlow框架和多项创新技术，实现了快速且高质量的文本引导图像编辑。

Abstract: We propose a fast text-guided image editing method called InstantEdit based
on the RectifiedFlow framework, which is structured as a few-step editing
process that preserves critical content while following closely to textual
instructions. Our approach leverages the straight sampling trajectories of
RectifiedFlow by introducing a specialized inversion strategy called PerRFI. To
maintain consistent while editable results for RectifiedFlow model, we further
propose a novel regeneration method, Inversion Latent Injection, which
effectively reuses latent information obtained during inversion to facilitate
more coherent and detailed regeneration. Additionally, we propose a
Disentangled Prompt Guidance technique to balance editability with detail
preservation, and integrate a Canny-conditioned ControlNet to incorporate
structural cues and suppress artifacts. Evaluation on the PIE image editing
dataset demonstrates that InstantEdit is not only fast but also achieves better
qualitative and quantitative results compared to state-of-the-art few-step
editing methods.

Abstract: In this paper, we present our solution for the semi-supervised learning track
(MER-SEMI) in MER2025. We propose a comprehensive framework, grounded in the
principle that "more is better," to construct a robust Mixture of Experts (MoE)
emotion recognition system. Our approach integrates a diverse range of input
modalities as independent experts, including novel signals such as knowledge
from large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and temporal Action Unit (AU)
information. To effectively utilize unlabeled data, we introduce a
consensus-based pseudo-labeling strategy, generating high-quality labels from
the agreement between a baseline model and Gemini, which are then used in a
two-stage training paradigm. Finally, we employ a multi-expert voting ensemble
combined with a rule-based re-ranking process to correct prediction bias and
better align the outputs with human preferences. Evaluated on the MER2025-SEMI
challenge dataset, our method achieves an F1-score of 0.8772 on the test set,
ranking 2nd in the track. Our code is available at

TL;DR: Fourier-VLM通过频域压缩视觉表示，显著减少计算开销和推理延迟，同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在减少视觉令牌数量时往往牺牲性能或增加额外成本。

Method: 利用离散余弦变换（DCT）对视觉特征进行低通滤波，压缩频域表示。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，推理FLOPs减少83.8%，生成速度提升31.2%。

Conclusion: Fourier-VLM在效率和实用性上具有显著优势，适用于多种架构。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) typically replace the predefined image
placeholder token (<image>) in textual instructions with visual features from
an image encoder, forming the input to a backbone Large Language Model (LLM).
However, the large number of vision tokens significantly increases the context
length, leading to high computational overhead and inference latency. While
previous efforts mitigate this by selecting only important visual features or
leveraging learnable queries to reduce token count, they often compromise
performance or introduce substantial extra costs. In response, we propose
Fourier-VLM, a simple yet efficient method that compresses visual
representations in the frequency domain. Our approach is motivated by the
observation that vision features output from the vision encoder exhibit
concentrated energy in low-frequency components. Leveraging this, we apply a
low-pass filter to the vision features using a two-dimentional Discrete Cosine
Transform (DCT). Notably, the DCT is efficiently computed via the Fast Fourier
Transform (FFT) operator with a time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(n\log n)$,
minimizing the extra computational cost while introducing no additional
parameters. Extensive experiments across various image-based benchmarks
demonstrate that Fourier-VLM achieves competitive performance with strong
generalizability across both LLaVA and Qwen-VL architectures. Crucially, it
reduce inference FLOPs by up to 83.8% and boots generation speed by 31.2%
compared to LLaVA-v1.5, highlighting the superior efficiency and practicality.

Motivation: 现有文本引导图像编辑方法会生成整个目标图像，导致计算成本高且编辑质量受限。

Result: 在广泛使用的图像编辑基准上达到新最优性能，并支持零样本测试时缩放。

Conclusion: NEP方法有效解决了现有方法的局限性，提升了编辑质量和效率。

Abstract: Text-guided image editing involves modifying a source image based on a
language instruction and, typically, requires changes to only small local
regions. However, existing approaches generate the entire target image rather
than selectively regenerate only the intended editing areas. This results in
(1) unnecessary computational costs and (2) a bias toward reconstructing
non-editing regions, which compromises the quality of the intended edits. To
resolve these limitations, we propose to formulate image editing as Next
Editing-token Prediction (NEP) based on autoregressive image generation, where
only regions that need to be edited are regenerated, thus avoiding unintended
modification to the non-editing areas. To enable any-region editing, we propose
to pre-train an any-order autoregressive text-to-image (T2I) model. Once
trained, it is capable of zero-shot image editing and can be easily adapted to
NEP for image editing, which achieves a new state-of-the-art on widely used
image editing benchmarks. Moreover, our model naturally supports test-time
scaling (TTS) through iteratively refining its generation in a zero-shot
manner. The project page is: https://nep-bigai.github.io/

Method: 采用GRPO强化学习算法，结合三种VQA特定奖励（钟形回归奖励、成对排序奖励和时间一致性奖励），模拟人类感知决策。

Result: 在域内和域外VQA基准测试中表现优异，同时在失真归因和质量描述任务中优于现有模型。

Conclusion: 强化学习为构建仅需分数级监督的泛化性和可解释性VQA模型提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Video quality assessment (VQA) aims to objectively quantify perceptual
quality degradation in alignment with human visual perception. Despite recent
advances, existing VQA models still suffer from two critical limitations:
\textit{poor generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) videos} and
\textit{limited explainability}, which restrict their applicability in
real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose
\textbf{VQAThinker}, a reasoning-based VQA framework that leverages large
multimodal models (LMMs) with reinforcement learning to jointly model video
quality understanding and scoring, emulating human perceptual decision-making.
Specifically, we adopt group relative policy optimization (GRPO), a rule-guided
reinforcement learning algorithm that enables reasoning over video quality
under score-level supervision, and introduce three VQA-specific rewards: (1) a
\textbf{bell-shaped regression reward} that increases rapidly as the prediction
error decreases and becomes progressively less sensitive near the ground truth;
(2) a \textbf{pairwise ranking reward} that guides the model to correctly
determine the relative quality between video pairs; and (3) a \textbf{temporal
consistency reward} that encourages the model to prefer temporally coherent
videos over their perturbed counterparts. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that VQAThinker achieves state-of-the-art performance on both in-domain and OOD
VQA benchmarks, showing strong generalization for video quality scoring.
Furthermore, evaluations on video quality understanding tasks validate its
superiority in distortion attribution and quality description compared to
existing explainable VQA models and LMMs. These findings demonstrate that
reinforcement learning offers an effective pathway toward building
generalizable and explainable VQA models solely with score-level supervision.

Abstract: Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is closer than ever to becoming a
reality, sparking widespread enthusiasm in the research community to collect
and work with various modalities, including text, image, video, and audio.
Despite recent efforts, satellite spectral imagery, as an additional modality,
has yet to receive the attention it deserves. This area presents unique
challenges, but also holds great promise in advancing the capabilities of AGI
in understanding the natural world. In this paper, we argue why Earth
Observation data is useful for an intelligent model, and then we review
existing benchmarks and highlight their limitations in evaluating the
generalization ability of foundation models in this domain. This paper
emphasizes the need for a more comprehensive benchmark to evaluate earth
observation models. To facilitate this, we propose a comprehensive set of tasks
that a benchmark should encompass to effectively assess a model's ability to
understand and interact with Earth observation data.

Motivation: HybridEVS相机结合Quad Bayer CFA传感器和事件像素时，去马赛克过程中会出现混叠和伪影问题，现有方法难以在资源有限的移动设备上解决这些问题。

Method: TSANet采用两阶段网络设计，分别处理事件像素修复和去马赛克，并引入轻量级的Cross-Swin State Block，利用位置先验和状态空间模型增强全局依赖。

Result: TSANet在模拟和真实HybridEVS数据上表现出色，PSNR和SSIM优于现有方法DemosaicFormer，同时参数和计算成本分别降低1.86倍和3.29倍。

Conclusion: TSANet为移动设备上的高效图像去马赛克提供了新思路，模型轻量且性能优越。

Abstract: Event cameras like the Hybrid Event-based Vision Sensor (HybridEVS) camera
capture brightness changes as asynchronous "events" instead of frames, offering
advanced application on mobile photography. However, challenges arise from
combining a Quad Bayer Color Filter Array (CFA) sensor with event pixels
lacking color information, resulting in aliasing and artifacts on the
demosaicing process before downstream application. Current methods struggle to
address these issues, especially on resource-limited mobile devices. In
response, we introduce \textbf{TSANet}, a lightweight \textbf{T}wo-stage
network via \textbf{S}tate space augmented cross-\textbf{A}ttention, which can
handle event pixels inpainting and demosaicing separately, leveraging the
benefits of dividing complex tasks into manageable subtasks. Furthermore, we
introduce a lightweight Cross-Swin State Block that uniquely utilizes
positional prior for demosaicing and enhances global dependencies through the
state space model with linear complexity. In summary, TSANet demonstrates
excellent demosaicing performance on both simulated and real data of HybridEVS
while maintaining a lightweight model, averaging better results than the
previous state-of-the-art method DemosaicFormer across seven diverse datasets
in both PSNR and SSIM, while respectively reducing parameter and computation
costs by $1.86\times$ and $3.29\times$. Our approach presents new possibilities
for efficient image demosaicing on mobile devices. Code is available in the

Result: 实验证明JoNet网络能同时捕捉显著和伪装目标，性能优越。

Conclusion: SCJoint和SBSS有效实现双任务联合学习，提升性能。

Abstract: Salient object detection (SOD) and camouflaged object detection (COD) are two
closely related but distinct computer vision tasks. Although both are
class-agnostic segmentation tasks that map from RGB space to binary space, the
former aims to identify the most salient objects in the image, while the latter
focuses on detecting perfectly camouflaged objects that blend into the
background in the image. These two tasks exhibit strong contradictory
attributes. Previous works have mostly believed that joint learning of these
two tasks would confuse the network, reducing its performance on both tasks.
However, here we present an opposite perspective: with the correct approach to
learning, the network can simultaneously possess the capability to find both
salient and camouflaged objects, allowing both tasks to benefit from joint
learning. We propose SCJoint, a joint learning scheme for SOD and COD tasks,
assuming that the decoding processes of SOD and COD have different distribution
characteristics. The key to our method is to learn the respective means and
variances of the decoding processes for both tasks by inserting a minimal
amount of task-specific learnable parameters within a fully shared network
structure, thereby decoupling the contradictory attributes of the two tasks at
a minimal cost. Furthermore, we propose a saliency-based sampling strategy
(SBSS) to sample the training set of the SOD task to balance the training set
sizes of the two tasks. In addition, SBSS improves the training set quality and
shortens the training time. Based on the proposed SCJoint and SBSS, we train a
powerful generalist network, named JoNet, which has the ability to
simultaneously capture both ``salient" and ``camouflaged". Extensive
experiments demonstrate the competitive performance and effectiveness of our
proposed method. The code is available at https://github.com/linuxsino/JoNet.

Conclusion: BioMotion Arena可作为无真实值限制的灵活评估框架，提供直观的性能可视化。

Abstract: Evaluating the abilities of large models and manifesting their gaps are
challenging. Current benchmarks adopt either ground-truth-based score-form
evaluation on static datasets or indistinct textual chatbot-style human
preferences collection, which may not provide users with immediate, intuitive,
and perceptible feedback on performance differences. In this paper, we
introduce BioMotion Arena, a novel framework for evaluating large language
models (LLMs) and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) via visual
animation. Our methodology draws inspiration from the inherent visual
perception of motion patterns characteristic of living organisms that utilizes
point-light source imaging to amplify the performance discrepancies between
models. Specifically, we employ a pairwise comparison evaluation and collect
more than 45k votes for 53 mainstream LLMs and MLLMs on 90 biological motion
variants. Data analyses show that the crowd-sourced human votes are in good
agreement with those of expert raters, demonstrating the superiority of our
BioMotion Arena in offering discriminative feedback. We also find that over
90\% of evaluated models, including the cutting-edge open-source InternVL3 and
proprietary Claude-4 series, fail to produce fundamental humanoid point-light
groups, much less smooth and biologically plausible motions. This enables
BioMotion Arena to serve as a challenging benchmark for performance
visualization and a flexible evaluation framework without restrictions on
ground-truth.

Result: 在25名TD患者中验证，显著改善了滑车角度（SA）和滑车沟深度（TGD）。

Conclusion: 该方法无需CT扫描，减少了辐射，为术前和术中提供了高分辨率3D形态目标。

Abstract: To treat Trochlear Dysplasia (TD), current approaches rely mainly on
low-resolution clinical Magnetic Resonance (MR) scans and surgical intuition.
The surgeries are planned based on surgeons experience, have limited adoption
of minimally invasive techniques, and lead to inconsistent outcomes. We propose
a pipeline that generates super-resolved, patient-specific 3D pseudo-healthy
target morphologies from conventional clinical MR scans. First, we compute an
isotropic super-resolved MR volume using an Implicit Neural Representation
(INR). Next, we segment femur, tibia, patella, and fibula with a multi-label
custom-trained network. Finally, we train a Wavelet Diffusion Model (WDM) to
generate pseudo-healthy target morphologies of the trochlear region. In
contrast to prior work producing pseudo-healthy low-resolution 3D MR images,
our approach enables the generation of sub-millimeter resolved 3D shapes
compatible for pre- and intraoperative use. These can serve as preoperative
blueprints for reshaping the femoral groove while preserving the native patella
articulation. Furthermore, and in contrast to other work, we do not require a
CT for our pipeline - reducing the amount of radiation. We evaluated our
approach on 25 TD patients and could show that our target morphologies
significantly improve the sulcus angle (SA) and trochlear groove depth (TGD).

Motivation: 基于指令的编辑（尤其是视频）因训练数据有限而受限，DreamVE旨在通过统一图像和视频编辑模型解决这一问题。

Method: 两阶段训练策略（图像到视频），拼贴和生成模型数据合成，以及基于SOTA T2V模型的编辑框架。

Result: DreamVE在关键编辑类型上表现优异，泛化和迁移能力增强，但拼贴数据在属性编辑上表现较弱。

Conclusion: DreamVE通过统一框架和多样化数据合成，显著提升了指令编辑的实用性和性能。

Abstract: Instruction-based editing holds vast potential due to its simple and
efficient interactive editing format. However, instruction-based editing,
particularly for video, has been constrained by limited training data,
hindering its practical application. To this end, we introduce DreamVE, a
unified model for instruction-based image and video editing. Specifically, We
propose a two-stage training strategy: first image editing, then video editing.
This offers two main benefits: (1) Image data scales more easily, and models
are more efficient to train, providing useful priors for faster and better
video editing training. (2) Unifying image and video generation is natural and
aligns with current trends. Moreover, we present comprehensive training data
synthesis pipelines, including collage-based and generative model-based data
synthesis. The collage-based data synthesis combines foreground objects and
backgrounds to generate diverse editing data, such as object manipulation,
background changes, and text modifications. It can easily generate billions of
accurate, consistent, realistic, and diverse editing pairs. We pretrain DreamVE
on extensive collage-based data to achieve strong performance in key editing
types and enhance generalization and transfer capabilities. However,
collage-based data lacks some attribute editing cases, leading to a relative
drop in performance. In contrast, the generative model-based pipeline, despite
being hard to scale up, offers flexibility in handling attribute editing cases.
Therefore, we use generative model-based data to further fine-tune DreamVE.
Besides, we design an efficient and powerful editing framework for DreamVE. We
build on the SOTA T2V model and use a token concatenation with early drop
approach to inject source image guidance, ensuring strong consistency and
editability. The codes and models will be released.

Method: 引入连续时间一致性蒸馏和双视角对齐（分布对齐与轨迹对齐）。

Result: 在OpenVid-1M基准测试中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SwiftVideo在少步视频生成中高效且稳定。

Abstract: Diffusion-based or flow-based models have achieved significant progress in
video synthesis but require multiple iterative sampling steps, which incurs
substantial computational overhead. While many distillation methods that are
solely based on trajectory-preserving or distribution-matching have been
developed to accelerate video generation models, these approaches often suffer
from performance breakdown or increased artifacts under few-step settings. To
address these limitations, we propose \textbf{\emph{SwiftVideo}}, a unified and
stable distillation framework that combines the advantages of
trajectory-preserving and distribution-matching strategies. Our approach
introduces continuous-time consistency distillation to ensure precise
preservation of ODE trajectories. Subsequently, we propose a dual-perspective
alignment that includes distribution alignment between synthetic and real data
along with trajectory alignment across different inference steps. Our method
maintains high-quality video generation while substantially reducing the number
of inference steps. Quantitative evaluations on the OpenVid-1M benchmark
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches in
few-step video generation.

TL;DR: 提出AdaptInfer框架，通过动态文本引导的视觉令牌剪枝和跨模态注意力分析，显著降低推理成本，同时保持高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有剪枝方法未能充分利用推理过程中的动态内部信号，导致视觉令牌处理成本高。

Method: 提出动态文本引导剪枝机制和跨模态注意力分析，优化剪枝策略。

Result: 在LLaVA-1.5-7B上，CUDA延迟降低61.3%，平均精度保持92.9%。

Conclusion: AdaptInfer高效且通用，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance on
multimodal reasoning tasks such as visual question answering (VQA), but their
inference cost remains a significant challenge due to the large number of
vision tokens processed during the prefill stage. Existing pruning methods
often rely on directly using the attention patterns or static text prompt
guidance, failing to exploit the dynamic internal signals generated during
inference. To address these issues, we propose AdaptInfer, a plug-and-play
framework for adaptive vision token pruning in VLMs. First, we introduce a
fine-grained, dynamic text-guided pruning mechanism that reuses layer-wise
text-to-text attention maps to construct soft priors over text-token
importance, allowing more informed scoring of vision tokens at each stage.
Second, we perform an offline analysis of cross-modal attention shifts and
identify consistent inflection locations in inference, which inspire us to
propose a more principled and efficient pruning schedule. Our method is
lightweight and plug-and-play, also generalizable across multi-modal tasks.
Experimental results have verified the effectiveness of the proposed method.
For example, it reduces CUDA latency by 61.3\% while maintaining an average
accuracy of 92.9\% on vanilla LLaVA-1.5-7B. Under the same token budget,
AdaptInfer surpasses SOTA in accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前VQA方法依赖大规模预训练数据集，存在语义知识转移不足和计算资源消耗大的问题，而VLM在视觉任务中表现出色，为VQA提供了新思路。

Method: 提出Q-CLIP框架，利用SCMA增强视觉和文本表示，引入质量级别提示提升模型对视频质量的敏感度，并研究帧采样策略的影响。

Result: Q-CLIP在多个VQA数据集上表现优异，帧差采样策略提升了泛化性能。

Conclusion: Q-CLIP为VQA提供了一种高效且性能优越的解决方案，展示了VLM在质量评估中的潜力。

Abstract: Accurate and efficient Video Quality Assessment (VQA) has long been a key
research challenge. Current mainstream VQA methods typically improve
performance by pretraining on large-scale classification datasets (e.g.,
ImageNet, Kinetics-400), followed by fine-tuning on VQA datasets. However, this
strategy presents two significant challenges: (1) merely transferring semantic
knowledge learned from pretraining is insufficient for VQA, as video quality
depends on multiple factors (e.g., semantics, distortion, motion, aesthetics);
(2) pretraining on large-scale datasets demands enormous computational
resources, often dozens or even hundreds of times greater than training
directly on VQA datasets. Recently, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown
remarkable generalization capabilities across a wide range of visual tasks, and
have begun to demonstrate promising potential in quality assessment. In this
work, we propose Q-CLIP, the first fully VLMs-based framework for VQA. Q-CLIP
enhances both visual and textual representations through a Shared Cross-Modal
Adapter (SCMA), which contains only a minimal number of trainable parameters
and is the only component that requires training. This design significantly
reduces computational cost. In addition, we introduce a set of five learnable
quality-level prompts to guide the VLMs in perceiving subtle quality
variations, thereby further enhancing the model's sensitivity to video quality.
Furthermore, we investigate the impact of different frame sampling strategies
on VQA performance, and find that frame-difference-based sampling leads to
better generalization performance across datasets. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Q-CLIP exhibits excellent performance on several VQA datasets.

Abstract: Emotion serves as an essential component in daily human interactions.
Existing human motion generation frameworks do not consider the impact of
emotions, which reduces naturalness and limits their application in interactive
tasks, such as human reaction synthesis. In this work, we introduce a novel
task: generating diverse reaction motions in response to different emotional
cues. However, learning emotion representation from limited motion data and
incorporating it into a motion generation framework remains a challenging
problem. To address the above obstacles, we introduce a semi-supervised emotion
prior in an actor-reactor diffusion model to facilitate emotion-driven reaction
synthesis. Specifically, based on the observation that motion clips within a
short sequence tend to share the same emotion, we first devise a
semi-supervised learning framework to train an emotion prior. With this prior,
we further train an actor-reactor diffusion model to generate reactions by
considering both spatial interaction and emotional response. Finally, given a
motion sequence of an actor, our approach can generate realistic reactions
under various emotional conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that our
model outperforms existing reaction generation methods. The code and data will
be made publicly available at https://ereact.github.io/

Motivation: 数字时代中，高级图像编辑工具威胁视觉内容的真实性，现有IML方法依赖大规模标注数据，但数据集规模不足且多样性有限，限制了模型在真实场景中的表现。

Method: 提出UGD-IML框架，利用扩散模型学习数据分布，减少对标注数据的依赖；通过类别嵌入机制和参数共享设计，实现IML和CIML任务的无缝切换。

Result: 在多个数据集上，UGD-IML在IML和CIML任务中的F1指标分别平均优于现有方法9.66和4.36，并在不确定性估计、可视化和鲁棒性方面表现优异。

Conclusion: UGD-IML通过生成模型和端到端设计，高效解决了IML和CIML任务的数据依赖和效率问题，为图像篡改检测提供了新思路。

Abstract: In the digital age, advanced image editing tools pose a serious threat to the
integrity of visual content, making image forgery detection and localization a
key research focus. Most existing Image Manipulation Localization (IML) methods
rely on discriminative learning and require large, high-quality annotated
datasets. However, current datasets lack sufficient scale and diversity,
limiting model performance in real-world scenarios. To overcome this, recent
studies have explored Constrained IML (CIML), which generates pixel-level
annotations through algorithmic supervision. However, existing CIML approaches
often depend on complex multi-stage pipelines, making the annotation process
inefficient. In this work, we propose a novel generative framework based on
diffusion models, named UGD-IML, which for the first time unifies both IML and
CIML tasks within a single framework. By learning the underlying data
distribution, generative diffusion models inherently reduce the reliance on
large-scale labeled datasets, allowing our approach to perform effectively even
under limited data conditions. In addition, by leveraging a class embedding
mechanism and a parameter-sharing design, our model seamlessly switches between
IML and CIML modes without extra components or training overhead. Furthermore,
the end-to-end design enables our model to avoid cumbersome steps in the data
annotation process. Extensive experimental results on multiple datasets
demonstrate that UGD-IML outperforms the SOTA methods by an average of 9.66 and
4.36 in terms of F1 metrics for IML and CIML tasks, respectively. Moreover, the
proposed method also excels in uncertainty estimation, visualization and
robustness.

Conclusion: MCA通过联合校正和对齐策略，显著提升了噪声标签条件下的跨模态检索性能。

Abstract: With the increasing availability of 2D and 3D data, significant advancements
have been made in the field of cross-modal retrieval. Nevertheless, the
existence of imperfect annotations presents considerable challenges, demanding
robust solutions for 2D-3D cross-modal retrieval in the presence of noisy label
conditions. Existing methods generally address the issue of noise by dividing
samples independently within each modality, making them susceptible to
overfitting on corrupted labels. To address these issues, we propose a robust
2D-3D \textbf{M}ulti-level cross-modal adaptive \textbf{C}orrection and
\textbf{A}lignment framework (MCA). Specifically, we introduce a Multimodal
Joint label Correction (MJC) mechanism that leverages multimodal historical
self-predictions to jointly model the modality prediction consistency, enabling
reliable label refinement. Additionally, we propose a Multi-level Adaptive
Alignment (MAA) strategy to effectively enhance cross-modal feature semantics
and discrimination across different levels. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the superiority of our method, MCA, which achieves state-of-the-art performance
on both conventional and realistic noisy 3D benchmarks, highlighting its
generality and effectiveness.

Result: 在CROHME基准测试中，性能优于现有自监督和全监督基线方法。

Conclusion: 渐进注意力机制有效提升手写数学表达式识别性能，自监督方法减少对标注数据的依赖。

Abstract: Recognizing handwritten mathematical expressions (HMER) is a challenging task
due to the inherent two-dimensional structure, varying symbol scales, and
complex spatial relationships among symbols. In this paper, we present a
self-supervised learning (SSL) framework for HMER that eliminates the need for
expensive labeled data. Our approach begins by pretraining an image encoder
using a combination of global and local contrastive loss, enabling the model to
learn both holistic and fine-grained representations. A key contribution of
this work is a novel self-supervised attention network, which is trained using
a progressive spatial masking strategy. This attention mechanism is designed to
learn semantically meaningful focus regions, such as operators, exponents, and
nested mathematical notation, without requiring any supervision. The
progressive masking curriculum encourages the network to become increasingly
robust to missing or occluded visual information, ultimately improving
structural understanding. Our complete pipeline consists of (1) self-supervised
pretraining of the encoder, (2) self-supervised attention learning, and (3)
supervised fine-tuning with a transformer decoder to generate LATEX sequences.
Extensive experiments on CROHME benchmarks demonstrate that our method
outperforms existing SSL and fully supervised baselines, validating the
effectiveness of our progressive attention mechanism in enhancing HMER
performance. Our codebase can be found here.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度神经网络（DNNs）因内部表示不透明而难以解释的问题，并弥补FMCE方法缺乏实验验证和闭环集成的不足。

Method: 提出FMCE-Net++框架，集成预训练的FMCE-Net作为辅助头，生成FMCS预测，并通过表示辅助损失（RAL）动态平衡分类损失和特征收敛优化。

Result: 在多个数据集上实验显示，FMCE-Net++无需架构修改或额外数据即可提升性能，如ResNet-50/CIFAR-10准确率提升1.16个百分点。

Conclusion: FMCE-Net++能有效提升模型性能，验证了其在优化特征收敛方面的有效性。

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) face interpretability challenges due to their
opaque internal representations. While Feature Map Convergence Evaluation
(FMCE) quantifies module-level convergence via Feature Map Convergence Scores
(FMCS), it lacks experimental validation and closed-loop integration. To
address this limitation, we propose FMCE-Net++, a novel training framework that
integrates a pretrained, frozen FMCE-Net as an auxiliary head. This module
generates FMCS predictions, which, combined with task labels, jointly supervise
backbone optimization through a Representation Auxiliary Loss. The RAL
dynamically balances the primary classification loss and feature convergence
optimization via a tunable \Representation Abstraction Factor. Extensive
experiments conducted on MNIST, CIFAR-10, FashionMNIST, and CIFAR-100
demonstrate that FMCE-Net++ consistently enhances model performance without
architectural modifications or additional data. Key experimental outcomes
include accuracy gains of $+1.16$ pp (ResNet-50/CIFAR-10) and $+1.08$ pp
(ShuffleNet v2/CIFAR-100), validating that FMCE-Net++ can effectively elevate
state-of-the-art performance ceilings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开放词汇语义分割面临语义类别广泛且粒度细的挑战，现有弱监督方法依赖类别特定监督和不适合对比学习的特征构建方法，导致语义对齐差和性能低下。

Method: SynSeg采用MCCL策略结合类别内和类别间对齐与分离，并通过FSS框架重构判别性特征，避免视觉编码器引入的前景偏差。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，SynSeg表现优于现有方法，例如在VOC上准确率提升4.5%，Context上提升8.9%。

Conclusion: SynSeg在弱监督下显著提升了语义定位和区分能力，为开放词汇语义分割提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation in open-vocabulary scenarios presents significant
challenges due to the wide range and granularity of semantic categories.
Existing weakly-supervised methods often rely on category-specific supervision
and ill-suited feature construction methods for contrastive learning, leading
to semantic misalignment and poor performance. In this work, we propose a novel
weakly-supervised approach, SynSeg, to address the challenges. SynSeg performs
Multi-Category Contrastive Learning (MCCL) as a stronger training signal with a
new feature reconstruction framework named Feature Synergy Structure (FSS).
Specifically, MCCL strategy robustly combines both intra- and inter-category
alignment and separation in order to make the model learn the knowledge of
correlations from different categories within the same image. Moreover, FSS
reconstructs discriminative features for contrastive learning through prior
fusion and semantic-activation-map enhancement, effectively avoiding the
foreground bias introduced by the visual encoder. In general, SynSeg
effectively improves the abilities in semantic localization and discrimination
under weak supervision. Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that
our method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. For instance,
SynSeg achieves higher accuracy than SOTA baselines by 4.5\% on VOC, 8.9\% on
Context, 2.6\% on Object and 2.0\% on City.

Conclusion: CAE高效但缺乏物理可解释性，未来可开发物理信息版本的CAE。

Abstract: This study applied representation learning algorithms to satellite images and
evaluated the learned latent spaces with classifications of various weather
events. The algorithms investigated include the classical linear
transformation, i.e., principal component analysis (PCA), state-of-the-art deep
learning method, i.e., convolutional autoencoder (CAE), and a residual network
pre-trained with large image datasets (PT). The experiment results indicated
that the latent space learned by CAE consistently showed higher threat scores
for all classification tasks. The classifications with PCA yielded high hit
rates but also high false-alarm rates. In addition, the PT performed
exceptionally well at recognizing tropical cyclones but was inferior in other
tasks. Further experiments suggested that representations learned from
higher-resolution datasets are superior in all classification tasks for
deep-learning algorithms, i.e., CAE and PT. We also found that smaller latent
space sizes had minor impact on the classification task's hit rate. Still, a
latent space dimension smaller than 128 caused a significantly higher false
alarm rate. Though the CAE can learn latent spaces effectively and efficiently,
the interpretation of the learned representation lacks direct connections to
physical attributions. Therefore, developing a physics-informed version of CAE
can be a promising outlook for the current work.

Conclusion: SC-Captioner通过强化学习和精细奖励设计，有效提升了图像描述的质量。

Abstract: We propose SC-Captioner, a reinforcement learning framework that enables the
self-correcting capability of image caption models. Our crucial technique lies
in the design of the reward function to incentivize accurate caption
corrections. Specifically, the predicted and reference captions are decomposed
into object, attribute, and relation sets using scene-graph parsing algorithms.
We calculate the set difference between sets of initial and self-corrected
captions to identify added and removed elements. These elements are matched
against the reference sets to calculate correctness bonuses for accurate
refinements and mistake punishments for wrong additions and removals, thereby
forming the final reward. For image caption quality assessment, we propose a
set of metrics refined from CAPTURE that alleviate its incomplete precision
evaluation and inefficient relation matching problems. Furthermore, we collect
a fine-grained annotated image caption dataset, RefinedCaps, consisting of 6.5K
diverse images from COCO dataset. Experiments show that applying SC-Captioner
on large visual-language models can generate better image captions across
various scenarios, significantly outperforming the direct preference
optimization training strategy.

Result: 在五个领域数据集上，VeSCA性能优于现有方法12.7%。

Conclusion: SAM的脆弱性对下游模型构成风险，需开发更鲁棒的基础模型。

Abstract: While the Segment Anything Model (SAM) transforms interactive segmentation
with zero-shot abilities, its inherent vulnerabilities present a single-point
risk, potentially leading to the failure of numerous downstream applications.
Proactively evaluating these transferable vulnerabilities is thus imperative.
Prior adversarial attacks on SAM often present limited transferability due to
insufficient exploration of common weakness across domains. To address this, we
propose Vertex-Refining Simplicial Complex Attack (VeSCA), a novel method that
leverages only the encoder of SAM for generating transferable adversarial
examples. Specifically, it achieves this by explicitly characterizing the
shared vulnerable regions between SAM and downstream models through a
parametric simplicial complex. Our goal is to identify such complexes within
adversarially potent regions by iterative vertex-wise refinement. A lightweight
domain re-adaptation strategy is introduced to bridge domain divergence using
minimal reference data during the initialization of simplicial complex.
Ultimately, VeSCA generates consistently transferable adversarial examples
through random simplicial complex sampling. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that VeSCA achieves performance improved by 12.7% compared to state-of-the-art
methods across three downstream model categories across five domain-specific
datasets. Our findings further highlight the downstream model risks posed by
SAM's vulnerabilities and emphasize the urgency of developing more robust
foundation models.

Abstract: We propose a novel 3D gaze redirection framework that leverages an explicit
3D eyeball structure. Existing gaze redirection methods are typically based on
neural radiance fields, which employ implicit neural representations via volume
rendering. Unlike these NeRF-based approaches, where the rotation and
translation of 3D representations are not explicitly modeled, we introduce a
dedicated 3D eyeball structure to represent the eyeballs with 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS). Our method generates photorealistic images that faithfully
reproduce the desired gaze direction by explicitly rotating and translating the
3D eyeball structure. In addition, we propose an adaptive deformation module
that enables the replication of subtle muscle movements around the eyes.
Through experiments conducted on the ETH-XGaze dataset, we demonstrate that our
framework is capable of generating diverse novel gaze images, achieving
superior image quality and gaze estimation accuracy compared to previous
state-of-the-art methods.

considered as a whole and transformed into a condition embedding, while the
inertial measurement is concatenated with the noisy body pose frame by frame to
construct a sequential input for the diffusion model. Firstly, we observe that
the visual information may be unavailable in some frames due to occlusions or
subjects moving out of the camera view. Thus incorporating the sequential
visual features as a whole to get a single feature embedding is robust to the
occasional degenerations of visual information in those frames. On the other
hand, the IMU measurements are robust to occlusions and always stable when
signal transmission has no problem. So incorporating them frame-wisely could
better explore the temporal information for the system. Experiments have
demonstrated the effectiveness of the system design and its state-of-the-art
performance in pose estimation compared with the previous works. Our codes are

*Hanqing Wang,Yuan Tian,Mingyu Liu,Zhenhao Zhang,Xiangyang Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SDEval是一个动态安全评估框架，通过调整安全基准的分布和复杂性来应对MLLM的安全问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有数据集因MLLM发展而可能过时及数据污染问题。

Method: 采用文本、图像和文本-图像动态策略生成新样本。

Result: SDEval显著影响安全评估，缓解数据污染，并暴露MLLM的安全限制。

Conclusion: SDEval是一个通用框架，适用于现有安全和能力基准。

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving landscape of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs), the safety concerns of their outputs have earned significant
attention. Although numerous datasets have been proposed, they may become
outdated with MLLM advancements and are susceptible to data contamination
issues. To address these problems, we propose \textbf{SDEval}, the
\textit{first} safety dynamic evaluation framework to controllably adjust the
distribution and complexity of safety benchmarks. Specifically, SDEval mainly
adopts three dynamic strategies: text, image, and text-image dynamics to
generate new samples from original benchmarks. We first explore the individual
effects of text and image dynamics on model safety. Then, we find that
injecting text dynamics into images can further impact safety, and conversely,
injecting image dynamics into text also leads to safety risks. SDEval is
general enough to be applied to various existing safety and even capability
benchmarks. Experiments across safety benchmarks, MLLMGuard and VLSBench, and
capability benchmarks, MMBench and MMVet, show that SDEval significantly
influences safety evaluation, mitigates data contamination, and exposes safety
limitations of MLLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/hq-King/SDEval

Motivation: 解决多模态视觉模型中晚期特征融合和查询选择不足的问题，以及固定词汇表的限制。

Method: 1. 早期融合机制统一文本/视觉提示和主干特征；2. 顺序对齐查询选择优化文本与视觉查询的结构对齐；3. 生成数据引擎通过双路径交叉验证减少标签噪声。

Result: Prompt-DINO在开放世界检测基准上达到最先进性能，语义覆盖范围显著扩大。

Conclusion: Prompt-DINO为开放世界场景下的可扩展多模态检测和数据生成建立了新范式。

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal vision models have highlighted limitations
in late-stage feature fusion and suboptimal query selection for hybrid prompts
open-world segmentation, alongside constraints from caption-derived
vocabularies. To address these challenges, we propose Prompt-DINO, a
text-guided visual Prompt DINO framework featuring three key innovations.
First, we introduce an early fusion mechanism that unifies text/visual prompts
and backbone features at the initial encoding stage, enabling deeper
cross-modal interactions to resolve semantic ambiguities. Second, we design
order-aligned query selection for DETR-based architectures, explicitly
optimizing the structural alignment between text and visual queries during
decoding to enhance semantic-spatial consistency. Third, we develop a
generative data engine powered by the Recognize Anything via Prompting (RAP)
model, which synthesizes 0.5B diverse training instances through a dual-path
cross-verification pipeline, reducing label noise by 80.5% compared to
conventional approaches. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Prompt-DINO
achieves state-of-the-art performance on open-world detection benchmarks while
significantly expanding semantic coverage beyond fixed-vocabulary constraints.
Our work establishes a new paradigm for scalable multimodal detection and data
generation in open-world scenarios. Data&Code are available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为DSConv的动态卷积核分割方法，结合注意力机制提升图像融合效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法多依赖标准卷积，而自适应卷积能更好利用遥感图像像素相关性。

Method: 动态分割卷积核并结合注意力机制，选择感兴趣位置，提升特征提取能力。

Result: DSConv在泛化、优化和特征表示方面表现优异，实验证明其先进性能。

Conclusion: DSConv在图像融合任务中表现出优越性和广泛适用性。

Abstract: Aiming to obtain a high-resolution image, pansharpening involves the fusion
of a multi-spectral image (MS) and a panchromatic image (PAN), the low-level
vision task remaining significant and challenging in contemporary research.
Most existing approaches rely predominantly on standard convolutions, few
making the effort to adaptive convolutions, which are effective owing to the
inter-pixel correlations of remote sensing images. In this paper, we propose a
novel strategy for dynamically splitting convolution kernels in conjunction
with attention, selecting positions of interest, and splitting the original
convolution kernel into multiple smaller kernels, named DSConv. The proposed
DSConv more effectively extracts features of different positions within the
receptive field, enhancing the network's generalization, optimization, and
feature representation capabilities. Furthermore, we innovate and enrich
concepts of dynamic splitting convolution and provide a novel network
architecture for pansharpening capable of achieving the tasks more efficiently,
building upon this methodology. Adequate fair experiments illustrate the
effectiveness and the state-of-the-art performance attained by
DSConv.Comprehensive and rigorous discussions proved the superiority and
optimal usage conditions of DSConv.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VISTAR是一个用户中心、多维度的文本到图像（T2I）评估基准，通过混合方法（确定性指标和HWPQ方案）解决现有指标的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有T2I评估指标存在不足，需更全面、用户导向的评估方法。

Method: 采用两层次混合范式：确定性指标量化物理属性，HWPQ方案评估抽象语义。基于专家研究定义用户角色和评估角度。

Result: 指标与人类评估高度一致（>75%），HWPQ在抽象语义上达85.9%准确率。评估显示无通用最优模型，角色加权分数提供领域指导。

Conclusion: VISTAR为T2I评估提供全面、可复现的基准，资源公开以促进研究。

Abstract: We present VISTAR, a user-centric, multi-dimensional benchmark for
text-to-image (T2I) evaluation that addresses the limitations of existing
metrics. VISTAR introduces a two-tier hybrid paradigm: it employs
deterministic, scriptable metrics for physically quantifiable attributes (e.g.,
text rendering, lighting) and a novel Hierarchical Weighted P/N Questioning
(HWPQ) scheme that uses constrained vision-language models to assess abstract
semantics (e.g., style fusion, cultural fidelity). Grounded in a Delphi study
with 120 experts, we defined seven user roles and nine evaluation angles to
construct the benchmark, which comprises 2,845 prompts validated by over 15,000
human pairwise comparisons. Our metrics achieve high human alignment (>75%),
with the HWPQ scheme reaching 85.9% accuracy on abstract semantics,
significantly outperforming VQA baselines. Comprehensive evaluation of
state-of-the-art models reveals no universal champion, as role-weighted scores
reorder rankings and provide actionable guidance for domain-specific
deployment. All resources are publicly released to foster reproducible T2I
assessment.

Conclusion: MPF-KANSC框架显著提升了AD诊断的准确性和可解释性，为AD研究提供了新视角。

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that
severely impairs cognitive function and quality of life. Timely intervention in
AD relies heavily on early and precise diagnosis, which remains challenging due
to the complex and subtle structural changes in the brain. Most existing deep
learning methods focus only on a single plane of structural magnetic resonance
imaging (sMRI) and struggle to accurately capture the complex and nonlinear
relationships among pathological regions of the brain, thus limiting their
ability to precisely identify atrophic features. To overcome these limitations,
we propose an innovative framework, MPF-KANSC, which integrates multi-plane
fusion (MPF) for combining features from the coronal, sagittal, and axial
planes, and a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network-guided spatial-channel attention
mechanism (KANSC) to more effectively learn and represent sMRI atrophy
features. Specifically, the proposed model enables parallel feature extraction
from multiple anatomical planes, thus capturing more comprehensive structural
information. The KANSC attention mechanism further leverages a more flexible
and accurate nonlinear function approximation technique, facilitating precise
identification and localization of disease-related abnormalities. Experiments
on the ADNI dataset confirm that the proposed MPF-KANSC achieves superior
performance in AD diagnosis. Moreover, our findings provide new evidence of
right-lateralized asymmetry in subcortical structural changes during AD
progression, highlighting the model's promising interpretability.

Result: 实验表明，PostDiff显著提升了效率与保真度的权衡，且降低每步计算成本比减少去噪步骤更有效。

Conclusion: PostDiff为资源受限环境下的扩散模型部署提供了高效且保真的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown remarkable success across generative tasks, yet
their high computational demands challenge deployment on resource-limited
platforms. This paper investigates a critical question for compute-optimal
diffusion model deployment: Under a post-training setting without fine-tuning,
is it more effective to reduce the number of denoising steps or to use a
cheaper per-step inference? Intuitively, reducing the number of denoising steps
increases the variability of the distributions across steps, making the model
more sensitive to compression. In contrast, keeping more denoising steps makes
the differences smaller, preserving redundancy, and making post-training
compression more feasible. To systematically examine this, we propose PostDiff,
a training-free framework for accelerating pre-trained diffusion models by
reducing redundancy at both the input level and module level in a post-training
manner. At the input level, we propose a mixed-resolution denoising scheme
based on the insight that reducing generation resolution in early denoising
steps can enhance low-frequency components and improve final generation
fidelity. At the module level, we employ a hybrid module caching strategy to
reuse computations across denoising steps. Extensive experiments and ablation
studies demonstrate that (1) PostDiff can significantly improve the
fidelity-efficiency trade-off of state-of-the-art diffusion models, and (2) to
boost efficiency while maintaining decent generation fidelity, reducing
per-step inference cost is often more effective than reducing the number of
denoising steps. Our code is available at

Conclusion: UW-3DGS通过结合物理模型和高效优化，显著提升了水下3D重建的精度和实用性。

Abstract: Underwater 3D scene reconstruction faces severe challenges from light
absorption, scattering, and turbidity, which degrade geometry and color
fidelity in traditional methods like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF). While NeRF
extensions such as SeaThru-NeRF incorporate physics-based models, their MLP
reliance limits efficiency and spatial resolution in hazy environments. We
introduce UW-3DGS, a novel framework adapting 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for
robust underwater reconstruction. Key innovations include: (1) a plug-and-play
learnable underwater image formation module using voxel-based regression for
spatially varying attenuation and backscatter; and (2) a Physics-Aware
Uncertainty Pruning (PAUP) branch that adaptively removes noisy floating
Gaussians via uncertainty scoring, ensuring artifact-free geometry. The
pipeline operates in training and rendering stages. During training, noisy
Gaussians are optimized end-to-end with underwater parameters, guided by PAUP
pruning and scattering modeling. In rendering, refined Gaussians produce clean
Unattenuated Radiance Images (URIs) free from media effects, while learned
physics enable realistic Underwater Images (UWIs) with accurate light
transport. Experiments on SeaThru-NeRF and UWBundle datasets show superior
performance, achieving PSNR of 27.604, SSIM of 0.868, and LPIPS of 0.104 on
SeaThru-NeRF, with ~65% reduction in floating artifacts.

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优异，提供多尺度语言监督的高质量犯罪行为数据集。

Conclusion: MA-CFP为城市公共安全风险预警提供有效解决方案。

Abstract: With the acceleration of urbanization, criminal behavior in public scenes
poses an increasingly serious threat to social security. Traditional anomaly
detection methods based on feature recognition struggle to capture high-level
behavioral semantics from historical information, while generative approaches
based on Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail to meet real-time
requirements. To address these challenges, we propose MA-CBP, a criminal
behavior prediction framework based on multi-agent asynchronous collaboration.
This framework transforms real-time video streams into frame-level semantic
descriptions, constructs causally consistent historical summaries, and fuses
adjacent image frames to perform joint reasoning over long- and short-term
contexts. The resulting behavioral decisions include key elements such as event
subjects, locations, and causes, enabling early warning of potential criminal
activity. In addition, we construct a high-quality criminal behavior dataset
that provides multi-scale language supervision, including frame-level,
summary-level, and event-level semantic annotations. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance on multiple datasets
and offers a promising solution for risk warning in urban public safety
scenarios.

Conclusion: DBIF-AUNet显著优化了复杂胸水CT图像的分割精度，为临床诊断提供了更准确的支持。

Abstract: Pleural effusion semantic segmentation can significantly enhance the accuracy
and timeliness of clinical diagnosis and treatment by precisely identifying
disease severity and lesion areas. Currently, semantic segmentation of pleural
effusion CT images faces multiple challenges. These include similar gray levels
between effusion and surrounding tissues, blurred edges, and variable
morphology. Existing methods often struggle with diverse image variations and
complex edges, primarily because direct feature concatenation causes semantic
gaps. To address these challenges, we propose the Dual-Branch Interactive
Fusion Attention model (DBIF-AUNet). This model constructs a densely nested
skip-connection network and innovatively refines the Dual-Domain Feature
Disentanglement module (DDFD). The DDFD module orthogonally decouples the
functions of dual-domain modules to achieve multi-scale feature complementarity
and enhance characteristics at different levels. Concurrently, we design a
Branch Interaction Attention Fusion module (BIAF) that works synergistically
with the DDFD. This module dynamically weights and fuses global, local, and
frequency band features, thereby improving segmentation robustness.
Furthermore, we implement a nested deep supervision mechanism with hierarchical
adaptive hybrid loss to effectively address class imbalance. Through validation
on 1,622 pleural effusion CT images from Southwest Hospital, DBIF-AUNet
achieved IoU and Dice scores of 80.1% and 89.0% respectively. These results
outperform state-of-the-art medical image segmentation models U-Net++ and
Swin-UNet by 5.7%/2.7% and 2.2%/1.5% respectively, demonstrating significant
optimization in segmentation accuracy for complex pleural effusion CT images.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 持续视觉指令调整（CVIT）中，灾难性遗忘和参数效率低是主要挑战，需要一种高效的方法来平衡新任务学习和旧任务性能。

Method: LiLoRA通过共享LoRA矩阵A、对矩阵B进行低秩分解以减少任务特定参数，并引入余弦正则化稳定性损失来保持共享表示的一致性。

Result: 实验表明，LiLoRA在连续任务学习中表现优异，同时显著提高了参数效率。

Conclusion: LiLoRA为CVIT提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案，解决了灾难性遗忘和参数效率问题。

Abstract: Continual Visual Instruction Tuning (CVIT) enables Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) to incrementally learn new tasks over time. However, this
process is challenged by catastrophic forgetting, where performance on
previously learned tasks deteriorates as the model adapts to new ones. A common
approach to mitigate forgetting is architecture expansion, which introduces
task-specific modules to prevent interference. Yet, existing methods often
expand entire layers for each task, leading to significant parameter overhead
and poor scalability. To overcome these issues, we introduce LoRA in LoRA
(LiLoRA), a highly efficient architecture expansion method tailored for CVIT in
MLLMs. LiLoRA shares the LoRA matrix A across tasks to reduce redundancy,
applies an additional low-rank decomposition to matrix B to minimize
task-specific parameters, and incorporates a cosine-regularized stability loss
to preserve consistency in shared representations over time. Extensive
experiments on a diverse CVIT benchmark show that LiLoRA consistently achieves
superior performance in sequential task learning while significantly improving
parameter efficiency compared to existing approaches.

Motivation: 现有异常检测方法过于专业化，泛化能力有限，需要一种通用框架。

Method: AnomalyMoE将问题分解为三个语义层次，分别使用专家网络处理，并引入EIR和ESB模块优化专家多样性及利用率。

Result: 在8个数据集上表现优异，超越领域专用方法。

Conclusion: AnomalyMoE是一种高效、通用的异常检测解决方案。

Abstract: Anomaly detection is a critical task across numerous domains and modalities,
yet existing methods are often highly specialized, limiting their
generalizability. These specialized models, tailored for specific anomaly types
like textural defects or logical errors, typically exhibit limited performance
when deployed outside their designated contexts. To overcome this limitation,
we propose AnomalyMoE, a novel and universal anomaly detection framework based
on a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. Our key insight is to decompose the
complex anomaly detection problem into three distinct semantic hierarchies:
local structural anomalies, component-level semantic anomalies, and global
logical anomalies. AnomalyMoE correspondingly employs three dedicated expert
networks at the patch, component, and global levels, and is specialized in
reconstructing features and identifying deviations at its designated semantic
level. This hierarchical design allows a single model to concurrently
understand and detect a wide spectrum of anomalies. Furthermore, we introduce
an Expert Information Repulsion (EIR) module to promote expert diversity and an
Expert Selection Balancing (ESB) module to ensure the comprehensive utilization
of all experts. Experiments on 8 challenging datasets spanning industrial
imaging, 3D point clouds, medical imaging, video surveillance, and logical
anomaly detection demonstrate that AnomalyMoE establishes new state-of-the-art
performance, significantly outperforming specialized methods in their
respective domains.

Conclusion: PA-HOI数据集为运动生成方法提供了真实物理感知能力，验证了其在实际应用中的潜力。

Abstract: The Human-Object Interaction (HOI) task explores the dynamic interactions
between humans and objects in physical environments, providing essential
biomechanical and cognitive-behavioral foundations for fields such as robotics,
virtual reality, and human-computer interaction. However, existing HOI data
sets focus on details of affordance, often neglecting the influence of physical
properties of objects on human long-term motion. To bridge this gap, we
introduce the PA-HOI Motion Capture dataset, which highlights the impact of
objects' physical attributes on human motion dynamics, including human posture,
moving velocity, and other motion characteristics. The dataset comprises 562
motion sequences of human-object interactions, with each sequence performed by
subjects of different genders interacting with 35 3D objects that vary in size,
shape, and weight. This dataset stands out by significantly extending the scope
of existing ones for understanding how the physical attributes of different
objects influence human posture, speed, motion scale, and interacting
strategies. We further demonstrate the applicability of the PA-HOI dataset by
integrating it with existing motion generation methods, validating its capacity
to transfer realistic physical awareness.

Abstract: The Sharp/van der Heijde (SvdH) score has been widely used in clinical trials

complexity has limited its adoption in routine clinical practice. To address
the inefficiency of manual scoring, this work proposes a two-stage pipeline for
interpretable image-level SvdH score prediction using dual-hand radiographs.
Our approach extracts disease-relevant image regions and integrates them using
attention-based multiple instance learning to generate image-level features for
prediction. We propose two region extraction schemes: 1) sampling image tiles
most likely to contain abnormalities, and 2) cropping patches containing
disease-relevant joints. With Scheme 2, our best individual score prediction
model achieved a Pearson's correlation coefficient (PCC) of 0.943 and a root
mean squared error (RMSE) of 15.73. Ensemble learning further boosted
prediction accuracy, yielding a PCC of 0.945 and RMSE of 15.57, achieving
state-of-the-art performance that is comparable to that of experienced
radiologists (PCC = 0.97, RMSE = 18.75). Finally, our pipeline effectively
identified and made decisions based on anatomical structures which clinicians
consider relevant to RA progression.

Conclusion: TEFormer通过纹理感知和边缘引导机制，显著提升了城市遥感图像的语义分割精度。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of urban remote sensing images (URSIs) is crucial for
applications such as urban planning and environmental monitoring. However,
geospatial objects often exhibit subtle texture differences and similar spatial
structures, which can easily lead to semantic ambiguity and misclassification.
Moreover, challenges such as irregular object shapes, blurred boundaries, and
overlapping spatial distributions of semantic objects contribute to complex and
diverse edge morphologies, further complicating accurate segmentation. To
tackle these issues, we propose a texture-aware and edge-guided Transformer
(TEFormer) that integrates texture awareness and edge-guidance mechanisms for
semantic segmentation of URSIs. In the encoder, a texture-aware module (TaM) is
designed to capture fine-grained texture differences between visually similar
categories to enhance semantic discrimination. Then, an edge-guided tri-branch
decoder (Eg3Head) is constructed to preserve local edges and details for
multiscale context-awareness. Finally, an edge-guided feature fusion module
(EgFFM) is to fuse contextual and detail information with edge information to
realize refined semantic segmentation. Extensive experiments show that TEFormer
achieves mIoU of 88.57%, 81.46%, and 53.55% on the Potsdam, Vaihingen, and
LoveDA datasets, respectively, shows the effectiveness in URSI semantic
segmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法针对特定模糊类型设计，缺乏通用性，需要多个模型覆盖不同模糊场景，实用性不足。

Result: 该方法性能与专用模型相当，且在未见过的模糊场景中表现出优异的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 提出了一种高效、通用的图像去模糊方法，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Image deblurring, removing blurring artifacts from images, is a fundamental
task in computational photography and low-level computer vision. Existing
approaches focus on specialized solutions tailored to particular blur types,
thus, these solutions lack generalization. This limitation in current methods
implies requiring multiple models to cover several blur types, which is not
practical in many real scenarios. In this paper, we introduce the first
all-in-one deblurring method capable of efficiently restoring images affected
by diverse blur degradations, including global motion, local motion, blur in
low-light conditions, and defocus blur. We propose a mixture-of-experts (MoE)
decoding module, which dynamically routes image features based on the
recognized blur degradation, enabling precise and efficient restoration in an
end-to-end manner. Our unified approach not only achieves performance
comparable to dedicated task-specific models, but also demonstrates remarkable
robustness and generalization capabilities on unseen blur degradation
scenarios.

Motivation: 解决深度伪造检测器对未见伪造技术泛化能力不足的问题，避免复杂架构带来的计算负担。

Method: 仅微调CLIP模型的Layer Normalization参数，结合L2归一化和潜在空间增强，构建超球面特征流形。

Result: 在13个基准数据集上取得最优性能，平均跨数据集AUROC超越复杂方法。发现训练数据配对和多样性对泛化至关重要。

Conclusion: 通过最小化调整预训练模型，实现了高效且可复现的深度伪造检测方法，证明了泛化能力的提升。

Abstract: The generalization of deepfake detectors to unseen manipulation techniques
remains a challenge for practical deployment. Although many approaches adapt
foundation models by introducing significant architectural complexity, this
work demonstrates that robust generalization is achievable through a
parameter-efficient adaptation of a pre-trained CLIP vision encoder. The
proposed method, LNCLIP-DF, fine-tunes only the Layer Normalization parameters
(0.03% of the total) and enhances generalization by enforcing a hyperspherical
feature manifold using L2 normalization and latent space augmentations.
  We conducted an extensive evaluation on 13 benchmark datasets spanning from
2019 to 2025. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance,
outperforming more complex, recent approaches in average cross-dataset AUROC.
Our analysis yields two primary findings for the field: 1) training on paired
real-fake data from the same source video is essential for mitigating shortcut
learning and improving generalization, and 2) detection difficulty on academic
datasets has not strictly increased over time, with models trained on older,
diverse datasets showing strong generalization capabilities.
  This work delivers a computationally efficient and reproducible method,
proving that state-of-the-art generalization is attainable by making targeted,
minimal changes to a pre-trained CLIP model. The code will be made publicly
available upon acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 遥感图像分类中数据分散且隐私受限，FL是合适的学习范式，但通信开销大。

Method: FedX利用反向传播解释方法估计模型组件重要性，剪枝无关部分，生成稀疏全局模型以减少通信。

Result: 在BigEarthNet-S2和EuroSAT数据集上，FedX显著减少共享参数，同时提升模型泛化能力。

Conclusion: FedX有效降低通信开销，优于未剪枝模型和现有剪枝方法。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables the collaborative training of deep neural
networks across decentralized data archives (i.e., clients), where each client
stores data locally and only shares model updates with a central server. This
makes FL a suitable learning paradigm for remote sensing (RS) image
classification tasks, where data centralization may be restricted due to legal
and privacy constraints. However, a key challenge in applying FL to RS tasks is
the communication overhead caused by the frequent exchange of large model
updates between clients and the central server. To address this issue, in this
paper we propose a novel strategy (denoted as FedX) that uses
explanation-guided pruning to reduce communication overhead by minimizing the
size of the transmitted models without compromising performance. FedX leverages
backpropagation-based explanation methods to estimate the task-specific
importance of model components and prunes the least relevant ones at the
central server. The resulting sparse global model is then sent to clients,
substantially reducing communication overhead. We evaluate FedX on multi-label
scene classification using the BigEarthNet-S2 dataset and single-label scene
classification using the EuroSAT dataset. Experimental results show the success
of FedX in significantly reducing the number of shared model parameters while
enhancing the generalization capability of the global model, compared to both
unpruned model and state-of-the-art pruning methods. The code of FedX will be
available at https://git.tu-berlin.de/rsim/FedX.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of femur structures from Magnetic Resonance Imaging
(MRI) is critical for orthopedic diagnosis and surgical planning but remains
challenging due to the limitations of existing 2D and 3D deep learning-based
segmentation approaches. In this study, we propose XAG-Net, a novel 2.5D
U-Net-based architecture that incorporates pixel-wise cross-slice attention
(CSA) and skip attention gating (AG) mechanisms to enhance inter-slice
contextual modeling and intra-slice feature refinement. Unlike previous
CSA-based models, XAG-Net applies pixel-wise softmax attention across adjacent
slices at each spatial location for fine-grained inter-slice modeling.
Extensive evaluations demonstrate that XAG-Net surpasses baseline 2D, 2.5D, and
3D U-Net models in femur segmentation accuracy while maintaining computational
efficiency. Ablation studies further validate the critical role of the CSA and
AG modules, establishing XAG-Net as a promising framework for efficient and
accurate femur MRI segmentation.

Conclusion: SIFThinker通过空间感知和动态注意力修正，显著提升了复杂视觉任务的性能。

Abstract: Current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) still face significant
challenges in complex visual tasks (e.g., spatial understanding, fine-grained
perception). Prior methods have tried to incorporate visual reasoning, however,
they fail to leverage attention correction with spatial cues to iteratively
refine their focus on prompt-relevant regions. In this paper, we introduce
SIFThinker, a spatially-aware "think-with-images" framework that mimics human
visual perception. Specifically, SIFThinker enables attention correcting and
image region focusing by interleaving depth-enhanced bounding boxes and natural
language. Our contributions are twofold: First, we introduce a
reverse-expansion-forward-inference strategy that facilitates the generation of
interleaved image-text chains of thought for process-level supervision, which
in turn leads to the construction of the SIF-50K dataset. Besides, we propose
GRPO-SIF, a reinforced training paradigm that integrates depth-informed visual
grounding into a unified reasoning pipeline, teaching the model to dynamically
correct and focus on prompt-relevant regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that SIFThinker outperforms state-of-the-art methods in spatial understanding
and fine-grained visual perception, while maintaining strong general
capabilities, highlighting the effectiveness of our method.

Result: 在三个数据集的六种跨域设置中表现良好，仅需少量无标注目标视频。

Conclusion: URPA是一种高效、实用的跨域视频时间定位方法，适用于无标注场景和实时应用。

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (TG) aims to temporally locate video segments
matching a natural language description (a query) in a long video. While
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are effective at holistic semantic matching, they
often struggle with fine-grained temporal localisation. Recently, Group
Relative Policy Optimisation (GRPO) reformulates the inference process as a
reinforcement learning task, enabling fine-grained grounding and achieving
strong in-domain performance. However, GRPO relies on labelled data, making it
unsuitable in unlabelled domains. Moreover, because videos are large and
expensive to store and process, performing full-scale adaptation introduces
prohibitive latency and computational overhead, making it impractical for
real-time deployment. To overcome both problems, we introduce a Data-Efficient
Unlabelled Cross-domain Temporal Grounding method, from which a model is first
trained on a labelled source domain, then adapted to a target domain using only
a small number of unlabelled videos from the target domain. This approach
eliminates the need for target annotation and keeps both computational and
storage overhead low enough to run in real time. Specifically, we introduce.
Uncertainty-quantified Rollout Policy Adaptation (URPA) for cross-domain
knowledge transfer in learning video temporal grounding without target labels.
URPA generates multiple candidate predictions using GRPO rollouts, averages
them to form a pseudo label, and estimates confidence from the variance across
these rollouts. This confidence then weights the training rewards, guiding the
model to focus on reliable supervision. Experiments on three datasets across
six cross-domain settings show that URPA generalises well using only a few
unlabelled target videos. Codes will be released once published.

Method: 采用高斯溅射引导的专家混合模型（GS-MoE），每个专家专注特定异常类型，并通过时序高斯损失增强监督。

Result: 在UCF-Crime、XD-Violence和MSAD数据集上取得91.58% AUC，表现最优。

Conclusion: GS-MoE通过类别特异性专家和时序指导，为弱监督视频异常检测设定了新基准。

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) is a challenging task due to the variability of
anomalous events and the limited availability of labeled data. Under the
Weakly-Supervised VAD (WSVAD) paradigm, only video-level labels are provided
during training, while predictions are made at the frame level. Although
state-of-the-art models perform well on simple anomalies (e.g., explosions),
they struggle with complex real-world events (e.g., shoplifting). This
difficulty stems from two key issues: (1) the inability of current models to
address the diversity of anomaly types, as they process all categories with a
shared model, overlooking category-specific features; and (2) the weak
supervision signal, which lacks precise temporal information, limiting the
ability to capture nuanced anomalous patterns blended with normal events. To
address these challenges, we propose Gaussian Splatting-guided Mixture of
Experts (GS-MoE), a novel framework that employs a set of expert models, each
specialized in capturing specific anomaly types. These experts are guided by a
temporal Gaussian splatting loss, enabling the model to leverage temporal
consistency and enhance weak supervision. The Gaussian splatting approach
encourages a more precise and comprehensive representation of anomalies by
focusing on temporal segments most likely to contain abnormal events. The
predictions from these specialized experts are integrated through a
mixture-of-experts mechanism to model complex relationships across diverse
anomaly patterns. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a
91.58% AUC on the UCF-Crime dataset, and demonstrates superior results on
XD-Violence and MSAD datasets. By leveraging category-specific expertise and
temporal guidance, GS-MoE sets a new benchmark for VAD under weak supervision.

Motivation: 心脏MR图像因设备和协议差异导致域偏移，限制AI模型在真实场景的应用。传统方法如数据增强或迁移学习存在局限性。

Method: 使用扩散模型生成合成图像，保持结构和空间一致性，用于域泛化和域适应。

Result: 合成数据显著提升分割性能（p < 0.01），优于仅使用真实数据的方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决域偏移问题，减少对迁移学习的需求，适用于数据稀缺场景。

Abstract: Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, including cardiac MR, is prone to domain
shift due to variations in imaging devices and acquisition protocols. This
challenge limits the deployment of trained AI models in real-world scenarios,
where performance degrades on unseen domains. Traditional solutions involve
increasing the size of the dataset through ad-hoc image augmentation or
additional online training/transfer learning, which have several limitations.
Synthetic data offers a promising alternative, but anatomical/structural
consistency constraints limit the effectiveness of generative models in
creating image-label pairs. To address this, we propose a diffusion model (DM)
trained on a source domain that generates synthetic cardiac MR images that
resemble a given reference. The synthetic data maintains spatial and structural
fidelity, ensuring similarity to the source domain and compatibility with the
segmentation mask. We assess the utility of our generative approach in
multi-centre cardiac MR segmentation, using the 2D nnU-Net, 3D nnU-Net and
vanilla U-Net segmentation networks. We explore domain generalisation, where,
domain-invariant segmentation models are trained on synthetic source domain
data, and domain adaptation, where, we shift target domain data towards the
source domain using the DM. Both strategies significantly improved segmentation
performance on data from an unseen target domain, in terms of surface-based
metrics (Welch's t-test, p < 0.01), compared to training segmentation models on
real data alone. The proposed method ameliorates the need for transfer learning
or online training to address domain shift challenges in cardiac MR image
analysis, especially useful in data-scarce settings.

Conclusion: 改进的ViPro模型解决了初始状态依赖问题，为实际应用提供了更可靠的视频帧预测方法。

Abstract: Predicting future video frames is a challenging task with many downstream
applications. Previous work has shown that procedural knowledge enables deep
models for complex dynamical settings, however their model ViPro assumed a
given ground truth initial symbolic state. We show that this approach led to
the model learning a shortcut that does not actually connect the observed
environment with the predicted symbolic state, resulting in the inability to
estimate states given an observation if previous states are noisy. In this
work, we add several improvements to ViPro that enables the model to correctly
infer states from observations without providing a full ground truth state in
the beginning. We show that this is possible in an unsupervised manner, and
extend the original Orbits dataset with a 3D variant to close the gap to real
world scenarios.

Method: 分析15个城市的2,998张街景图像，结合Mehta的社会互动分类理论，使用线性回归模型控制天气、时间等因素。

Result: 天空视野指数与三类社会互动相关，绿色视野指数预测持久性互动，地方依恋与短暂性互动正相关。

Conclusion: 街景图像可用于研究社会互动与城市环境的关系，为城市设计提供数据支持。

Abstract: Designing socially active streets has long been a goal of urban planning, yet
existing quantitative research largely measures pedestrian volume rather than
the quality of social interactions. We hypothesize that street view imagery --
an inexpensive data source with global coverage -- contains latent social
information that can be extracted and interpreted through established social
science theory. As a proof of concept, we analyzed 2,998 street view images
from 15 cities using a multimodal large language model guided by Mehta's
taxonomy of passive, fleeting, and enduring sociability -- one illustrative
example of a theory grounded in urban design that could be substituted or
complemented by other sociological frameworks. We then used linear regression
models, controlling for factors like weather, time of day, and pedestrian
counts, to test whether the inferred sociability measures correlate with
city-level place attachment scores from the World Values Survey and with
environmental predictors (e.g., green, sky, and water view indices) derived
from individual street view images. Results aligned with long-standing urban
planning theory: the sky view index was associated with all three sociability
types, the green view index predicted enduring sociability, and place
attachment was positively associated with fleeting sociability. These results
provide preliminary evidence that street view images can be used to infer
relationships between specific types of social interactions and built
environment variables. Further research could establish street view imagery as
a scalable, privacy-preserving tool for studying urban sociability, enabling
cross-cultural theory testing and evidence-based design of socially vibrant
cities.

Abstract: Understanding abnormal events in videos is a vital and challenging task that
has garnered significant attention in a wide range of applications. Although
current video understanding Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are
capable of analyzing general videos, they often struggle to handle anomalies
due to the spatial and temporal sparsity of abnormal events, where the
redundant information always leads to suboptimal outcomes. To address these
challenges, exploiting the representation and generalization capabilities of
Vison Language Models (VLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose
VA-GPT, a novel MLLM designed for summarizing and localizing abnormal events in
various videos. Our approach efficiently aligns effective tokens between visual
encoders and LLMs through two key proposed modules: Spatial Effective Token
Selection (SETS) and Temporal Effective Token Generation (TETG). These modules
enable our model to effectively capture and analyze both spatial and temporal
information associated with abnormal events, resulting in more accurate
responses and interactions. Furthermore, we construct an instruction-following
dataset specifically for fine-tuning video-anomaly-aware MLLMs, and introduce a
cross-domain evaluation benchmark based on XD-Violence dataset. Our proposed
method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on various benchmarks.

Conclusion: 该方法能够高效实现两阶段图像分割，适用于平滑边界和双均值像素值的图像。

Abstract: In this paper, we describe an implementation of the two-phase image
segmentation algorithm proposed by Goldstein, Bresson, Osher in
\cite{gold:bre}. This algorithm partitions the domain of a given 2d image into
foreground and background regions, and each pixel of the image is assigned
membership to one of these two regions. The underlying assumption for the
segmentation model is that the pixel values of the input image can be
summarized by two distinct average values, and that the region boundaries are
smooth. Accordingly, the model is defined as an energy in which the variable is
a region membership function to assign pixels to either region, originally
proposed by Chan and Vese in \cite{chan:vese}. This energy is the sum of image
data terms in the regions and a length penalty for region boundaries.
Goldstein, Bresson, Osher modify the energy of Chan-Vese in \cite{gold:bre} so
that their new energy can be minimized efficiently using the split Bregman
method to produce an equivalent two-phase segmentation. We provide a detailed
implementation of this method \cite{gold:bre}, and document its performance
with several images over a range of algorithm parameters.

Abstract: A central problem in one-to-many facial identification is that the person in
the probe image may or may not have enrolled image(s) in the gallery; that is,
may be In-gallery or Out-of-gallery. Past approaches to detect when a rank-one
result is Out-of-gallery have mostly focused on finding a suitable threshold on
the similarity score. We take a new approach, using the additional enrolled
images of the identity with the rank-one result to predict if the rank-one
result is In-gallery / Out-of-gallery. Given a gallery of identities and
images, we generate In-gallery and Out-of-gallery training data by extracting
the ranks of additional enrolled images corresponding to the rank-one identity.
We then train a classifier to utilize this feature vector to predict whether a
rank-one result is In-gallery or Out-of-gallery. Using two different datasets
and four different matchers, we present experimental results showing that our
approach is viable for mugshot quality probe images, and also, importantly, for
probes degraded by blur, reduced resolution, atmospheric turbulence and
sunglasses. We also analyze results across demographic groups, and show that
In-gallery / Out-of-gallery classification accuracy is similar across
demographics. Our approach has the potential to provide an objective estimate
of whether a one-to-many facial identification is Out-of-gallery, and thereby
to reduce false positive identifications, wrongful arrests, and wasted
investigative time. Interestingly, comparing the results of older deep
CNN-based face matchers with newer ones suggests that the effectiveness of our
Out-of-gallery detection approach emerges only with matchers trained using
advanced margin-based loss functions.

TL;DR: TaAM-CPT是一种通过一致提示调优构建通用表示模型的方法，仅需文本数据即可扩展到无限模态，无需模态特定标注数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖大量模态特定标注数据或仅适用于单一模态，限制了通用性。

Method: TaAM-CPT结合模态提示池、文本构建和模态对齐文本编码器，通过设计和跨模态学习目标实现扩展。

Result: TaAM-CPT在视频、图像和音频分类等多个任务上取得领先结果，无需模态特定数据。

Conclusion: TaAM-CPT展示了通用表示模型的潜力，具有高度可扩展性和性能优势。

Abstract: The integration of prompt tuning with multimodal learning has shown
significant generalization abilities for various downstream tasks. Despite
advancements, existing methods heavily depend on massive modality-specific
labeled data (e.g., video, audio, and image), or are customized for a single
modality. In this study, we present Text as Any-Modality by Consistent Prompt
Tuning (TaAM-CPT), a scalable approach for constructing a general
representation model toward unlimited modalities using solely text data.
TaAM-CPT comprises modality prompt pools, text construction, and
modality-aligned text encoders from pre-trained models, which allows for
extending new modalities by simply adding prompt pools and modality-aligned
text encoders. To harmonize the learning across different modalities, TaAM-CPT
designs intra- and inter-modal learning objectives, which can capture category
details within modalities while maintaining semantic consistency across
different modalities. Benefiting from its scalable architecture and pre-trained
models, TaAM-CPT can be seamlessly extended to accommodate unlimited
modalities. Remarkably, without any modality-specific labeled data, TaAM-CPT
achieves leading results on diverse datasets spanning various modalities,
including video classification, image classification, and audio classification.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FVGen框架通过蒸馏视频扩散模型，显著提升稀疏视图3D重建的速度和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏视图在3D重建中常导致未观察区域的伪影，现有方法因采样速度慢而受限。

Method: 提出FVGen框架，使用GAN和软化反向KL散度最小化，将多步去噪教师模型蒸馏为少步去噪学生模型。

Result: 实验表明，FVGen在90%的采样时间减少下，生成相同数量且视觉质量相当（或更好）的新视图。

Conclusion: FVGen显著提升稀疏视图3D重建的时间效率，适用于需要多次运行预训练VDMs的任务。

Abstract: Recent progress in 3D reconstruction has enabled realistic 3D models from
dense image captures, yet challenges persist with sparse views, often leading
to artifacts in unseen areas. Recent works leverage Video Diffusion Models
(VDMs) to generate dense observations, filling the gaps when only sparse views
are available for 3D reconstruction tasks. A significant limitation of these
methods is their slow sampling speed when using VDMs. In this paper, we present
FVGen, a novel framework that addresses this challenge by enabling fast novel
view synthesis using VDMs in as few as four sampling steps. We propose a novel
video diffusion model distillation method that distills a multi-step denoising
teacher model into a few-step denoising student model using Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs) and softened reverse KL-divergence minimization.
Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that, compared to previous
works, our framework generates the same number of novel views with similar (or
even better) visual quality while reducing sampling time by more than 90%.
FVGen significantly improves time efficiency for downstream reconstruction
tasks, particularly when working with sparse input views (more than 2) where
pre-trained VDMs need to be run multiple times to achieve better spatial
coverage.

Motivation: 低分辨率图像限制了自动化分析的准确性，传统超分辨率方法仅关注像素级质量，未充分探索超分辨率图像保真度与下游分类性能的关系。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的方法，通过优化同时考虑图像质量和分类性能的损失函数，提高合成孔径雷达图像的分辨率。

Result: 该方法不仅提升了图像质量（通过科学验证的图像质量指标衡量），还提高了分类准确性。

Conclusion: 研究表明，将分类目标融入超分辨率过程可以有效提升分类性能。

Abstract: High-resolution imagery plays a critical role in improving the performance of
visual recognition tasks such as classification, detection, and segmentation.
In many domains, including remote sensing and surveillance, low-resolution
images can limit the accuracy of automated analysis. To address this,
super-resolution (SR) techniques have been widely adopted to attempt to
reconstruct high-resolution images from low-resolution inputs. Related
traditional approaches focus solely on enhancing image quality based on
pixel-level metrics, leaving the relationship between super-resolved image
fidelity and downstream classification performance largely underexplored. This
raises a key question: can integrating classification objectives directly into
the super-resolution process further improve classification accuracy? In this
paper, we try to respond to this question by investigating the relationship
between super-resolution and classification through the deployment of a
specialised algorithmic strategy. We propose a novel methodology that increases
the resolution of synthetic aperture radar imagery by optimising loss functions
that account for both image quality and classification performance. Our
approach improves image quality, as measured by scientifically ascertained
image quality indicators, while also enhancing classification accuracy.

Abstract: SAR ship classification faces the challenge of long-tailed datasets, which
complicates the classification of underrepresented classes. Oversampling
methods have proven effective in addressing class imbalance in optical data. In
this paper, we evaluated the effect of oversampling in the feature space for
SAR ship classification. We propose two novel algorithms inspired by the
Major-to-minor (M2m) method M2m$_f$, M2m$_u$. The algorithms are tested on two
public datasets, OpenSARShip (6 classes) and FuSARShip (9 classes), using three
state-of-the-art models as feature extractors: ViT, VGG16, and ResNet50.
Additionally, we also analyzed the impact of oversampling methods on different
class sizes. The results demonstrated the effectiveness of our novel methods
over the original M2m and baselines, with an average F1-score increase of 8.82%
for FuSARShip and 4.44% for OpenSARShip.

Abstract: Deep learning has revolutionized medical imaging, but its effectiveness is
severely limited by insufficient labeled training data. This paper introduces a
novel GAN-based semi-supervised learning framework specifically designed for
low labeled-data regimes, evaluated across settings with 5 to 50 labeled
samples per class. Our approach integrates three specialized neural networks --
a generator for class-conditioned image translation, a discriminator for
authenticity assessment and classification, and a dedicated classifier --
within a three-phase training framework. The method alternates between
supervised training on limited labeled data and unsupervised learning that
leverages abundant unlabeled images through image-to-image translation rather
than generation from noise. We employ ensemble-based pseudo-labeling that
combines confidence-weighted predictions from the discriminator and classifier
with temporal consistency through exponential moving averaging, enabling
reliable label estimation for unlabeled data. Comprehensive evaluation across
eleven MedMNIST datasets demonstrates that our approach achieves statistically
significant improvements over six state-of-the-art GAN-based semi-supervised
methods, with particularly strong performance in the extreme 5-shot setting
where the scarcity of labeled data is most challenging. The framework maintains
its superiority across all evaluated settings (5, 10, 20, and 50 shots per
class). Our approach offers a practical solution for medical imaging
applications where annotation costs are prohibitive, enabling robust
classification performance even with minimal labeled data. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模自然图像-文本数据集因弱监督导致语义对齐松散，而医学数据集虽对齐强但多样性低，这限制了CLIP模型的泛化能力。

Result: 在多种下游任务中验证了CLIPin的有效性和通用性。

Conclusion: CLIPin作为即插即用组件，显著提升了CLIP架构的性能。

Abstract: Large-scale natural image-text datasets, especially those automatically
collected from the web, often suffer from loose semantic alignment due to weak
supervision, while medical datasets tend to have high cross-modal correlation
but low content diversity. These properties pose a common challenge for
contrastive language-image pretraining (CLIP): they hinder the model's ability
to learn robust and generalizable representations. In this work, we propose
CLIPin, a unified non-contrastive plug-in that can be seamlessly integrated
into CLIP-style architectures to improve multimodal semantic alignment,
providing stronger supervision and enhancing alignment robustness. Furthermore,
two shared pre-projectors are designed for image and text modalities
respectively to facilitate the integration of contrastive and non-contrastive
learning in a parameter-compromise manner. Extensive experiments on diverse
downstream tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of CLIPin as a
plug-and-play component compatible with various contrastive frameworks. Code is

Motivation: 解决复杂域偏移（如地理偏移）中传统UDA方法的不足，利用语言模态的鲁棒性改进视觉模型。

Method: 1. 从目标样本的标题生成伪标签；2. 使用归一化CLIP相似度估计伪标签的不确定性；3. 提出多模态软对比学习损失对齐视觉和语言特征空间。

Result: 在经典（DomainNet）和复杂（GeoNet）域偏移上优于现有方法，达到新SOTA。

Conclusion: TRUST通过结合语言模态和不确定性估计，显著提升了复杂域偏移下的适应性能。

Abstract: Recent unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods have shown great success
in addressing classical domain shifts (e.g., synthetic-to-real), but they still
suffer under complex shifts (e.g. geographical shift), where both the
background and object appearances differ significantly across domains. Prior
works showed that the language modality can help in the adaptation process,
exhibiting more robustness to such complex shifts. In this paper, we introduce
TRUST, a novel UDA approach that exploits the robustness of the language
modality to guide the adaptation of a vision model. TRUST generates
pseudo-labels for target samples from their captions and introduces a novel
uncertainty estimation strategy that uses normalised CLIP similarity scores to
estimate the uncertainty of the generated pseudo-labels. Such estimated
uncertainty is then used to reweight the classification loss, mitigating the
adverse effects of wrong pseudo-labels obtained from low-quality captions. To
further increase the robustness of the vision model, we propose a multimodal
soft-contrastive learning loss that aligns the vision and language feature
spaces, by leveraging captions to guide the contrastive training of the vision
model on target images. In our contrastive loss, each pair of images acts as
both a positive and a negative pair and their feature representations are
attracted and repulsed with a strength proportional to the similarity of their
captions. This solution avoids the need for hardly determining positive and
negative pairs, which is critical in the UDA setting. Our approach outperforms
previous methods, setting the new state-of-the-art on classical (DomainNet) and
complex (GeoNet) domain shifts. The code will be available upon acceptance.

Conclusion: Text-Swin-UMamba模型在病灶分割任务中表现优异，显著优于纯图像或LLM驱动的方法。

Abstract: Segmentation of lesions on CT enables automatic measurement for clinical

Motivation: 城市化、气候变化和农业压力增加了对环境监测的需求，而现有遥感系统在空间和时间分辨率之间存在权衡。

Method: WGAST采用条件生成对抗网络架构，包括特征提取、融合、LST重建和噪声抑制四个阶段，并使用弱监督策略训练。

Result: WGAST在定量和定性评估中均优于现有方法，平均降低RMSE 17.18%，提高SSIM 11.00%，并能有效捕捉精细热模式。

Conclusion: WGAST是首个端到端深度学习框架，成功解决了高时空分辨率LST估计问题，代码已开源。

Abstract: Urbanization, climate change, and agricultural stress are increasing the
demand for precise and timely environmental monitoring. Land Surface
Temperature (LST) is a key variable in this context and is retrieved from
remote sensing satellites. However, these systems face a trade-off between
spatial and temporal resolution. While spatio-temporal fusion methods offer
promising solutions, few have addressed the estimation of daily LST at 10 m
resolution. In this study, we present WGAST, a Weakly-Supervised Generative
Network for Daily 10 m LST Estimation via Spatio-Temporal Fusion of Terra
MODIS, Landsat 8, and Sentinel-2. WGAST is the first end-to-end deep learning
framework designed for this task. It adopts a conditional generative
adversarial architecture, with a generator composed of four stages: feature
extraction, fusion, LST reconstruction, and noise suppression. The first stage
employs a set of encoders to extract multi-level latent representations from
the inputs, which are then fused in the second stage using cosine similarity,
normalization, and temporal attention mechanisms. The third stage decodes the
fused features into high-resolution LST, followed by a Gaussian filter to
suppress high-frequency noise. Training follows a weakly supervised strategy
based on physical averaging principles and reinforced by a PatchGAN
discriminator. Experiments demonstrate that WGAST outperforms existing methods
in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. Compared to the
best-performing baseline, on average, WGAST reduces RMSE by 17.18% and improves
SSIM by 11.00%. Furthermore, WGAST is robust to cloud-induced LST and
effectively captures fine-scale thermal patterns, as validated against 33
ground-based sensors. The code is available at

Conclusion: 模块化和多样化方法有效提升图表理解能力，ECD数据集为未来研究提供资源。

Abstract: Being able to effectively read scientific plots, or chart understanding, is a
central part toward building effective agents for science. However, existing
multimodal large language models (MLLMs), especially open-source ones, are
still falling behind with a typical success rate of 30%-50% on challenging
benchmarks. Previous studies on fine-tuning MLLMs with synthetic charts are
often restricted by their inadequate similarity to the real charts, which could
compromise model training and performance on complex real-world charts. In this
study, we show that modularizing chart generation and diversifying visual
details improves chart understanding capabilities. In particular, we design a
five-step data synthesis pipeline, where we separate data and function creation
for single plot generation, condition the generation of later subplots on
earlier ones for multi-subplot figures, visually diversify the generated
figures, filter out low quality data, and finally generate the question-answer
(QA) pairs with GPT-4o. This approach allows us to streamline the generation of
fine-tuning datasets and introduce the effective chart dataset (ECD), which
contains 10k+ chart images and 300k+ QA pairs, covering 25 topics and featuring
250+ chart type combinations with high visual complexity. We show that ECD
consistently improves the performance of various MLLMs on a range of real-world
and synthetic test sets. Code, data and models are available at:

Conclusion: LightSwitch在效率和效果上均优于现有方法，适用于多样材质物体的重光照。

Abstract: Recent approaches for 3D relighting have shown promise in integrating 2D
image relighting generative priors to alter the appearance of a 3D
representation while preserving the underlying structure. Nevertheless,
generative priors used for 2D relighting that directly relight from an input
image do not take advantage of intrinsic properties of the subject that can be
inferred or cannot consider multi-view data at scale, leading to subpar
relighting. In this paper, we propose Lightswitch, a novel finetuned
material-relighting diffusion framework that efficiently relights an arbitrary
number of input images to a target lighting condition while incorporating cues
from inferred intrinsic properties. By using multi-view and material
information cues together with a scalable denoising scheme, our method
consistently and efficiently relights dense multi-view data of objects with
diverse material compositions. We show that our 2D relighting prediction
quality exceeds previous state-of-the-art relighting priors that directly
relight from images. We further demonstrate that LightSwitch matches or
outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion inverse rendering methods in relighting
synthetic and real objects in as little as 2 minutes.

Conclusion: DogFit为扩散模型迁移学习提供了一种高效可控的解决方案。

Abstract: Transfer learning of diffusion models to smaller target domains is
challenging, as naively fine-tuning the model often results in poor
generalization. Test-time guidance methods help mitigate this by offering
controllable improvements in image fidelity through a trade-off with sample
diversity. However, this benefit comes at a high computational cost, typically
requiring dual forward passes during sampling. We propose the Domain-guided
Fine-tuning (DogFit) method, an effective guidance mechanism for diffusion
transfer learning that maintains controllability without incurring additional
computational overhead. DogFit injects a domain-aware guidance offset into the
training loss, effectively internalizing the guided behavior during the
fine-tuning process. The domain-aware design is motivated by our observation
that during fine-tuning, the unconditional source model offers a stronger
marginal estimate than the target model. To support efficient controllable
fidelity-diversity trade-offs at inference, we encode the guidance strength
value as an additional model input through a lightweight conditioning
mechanism. We further investigate the optimal placement and timing of the
guidance offset during training and propose two simple scheduling strategies,
i.e., late-start and cut-off, which improve generation quality and training
stability. Experiments on DiT and SiT backbones across six diverse target
domains show that DogFit can outperform prior guidance methods in transfer
learning in terms of FID and FDDINOV2 while requiring up to 2x fewer sampling
TFLOPS.

Conclusion: 该方法为草显示的颜色特性模拟提供了一种高效且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent research has focused on incorporating media into living environments
via color-controlled materials and image display. In particular, grass-based
displays have drawn attention as landscape-friendly interactive interfaces. To
develop the grass display, it is important to obtain the grass color change
characteristics that depend on the real environment. However, conventional
methods require experiments on actual equipment every time the lighting or
viewpoint changes, which is time-consuming and costly. Although research has
begun on simulating grass colors, this approach still faces significant issues
as it takes many hours for a single measurement. In this paper, we explore an
interactive simulation of a grass display color change characteristic based on
real-world conditions in a virtual environment. We evaluated our method's
accuracy by simulating grass color characteristics across multiple viewpoints
and environments, and then compared the results against prior work. The results
indicated that our method tended to simulate the grass color characteristics
similar to the actual characteristics and showed the potential to do so more
quickly and with comparable accuracy to the previous study.

Result: 在CarMaker模拟器中，BR-MPPI在12米拖车的倒车和前进停车任务中表现优于标准MPPI和带碰撞成本的MPPI基线，计算速度超过100Hz。

Conclusion: BR-MPPI显著提升了MPPI在复杂环境中的导航能力，具有高效性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Articulated vehicles such as tractor-trailers, yard trucks, and similar
platforms must often reverse and maneuver in cluttered spaces where pedestrians
are present. We present how Barrier-Rate guided Model Predictive Path Integral
(BR-MPPI) control can solve navigation in such challenging environments.
BR-MPPI embeds Control Barrier Function (CBF) constraints directly into the
path-integral update. By steering the importance-sampling distribution toward
collision-free, dynamically feasible trajectories, BR-MPPI enhances the
exploration strength of MPPI and improves robustness of resulting trajectories.
The method is evaluated in the high-fidelity CarMaker simulator on a 12 [m]
tractor-trailer tasked with reverse and forward parking in a parking lot.
BR-MPPI computes control inputs in above 100 [Hz] on a single GPU (for
scenarios with eight obstacles) and maintains better parking clearance than a
standard MPPI baseline and an MPPI with collision cost baseline.

Abstract: The disassembly of small household appliances poses significant challenges
due to their complex and curved geometries, which render traditional rigid
fixtures inadequate. In this paper, we propose a modular vacuum-based fixturing
system that leverages commercially available balloon-type soft grippers to
conform to arbitrarily shaped surfaces and provide stable support during
screw-removal tasks. To enable a reliable deployment of the system, we develop
a stability-aware planning framework that samples the bottom surface of the
target object, filters candidate contact points based on geometric continuity,
and evaluates support configurations using convex hull-based static stability
criteria. We compare the quality of object placement under different numbers
and configurations of balloon hands. In addition, real-world experiments were
conducted to compare the success rates of traditional rigid fixtures with our
proposed system. The results demonstrate that our method consistently achieves
higher success rates and superior placement stability during screw removal
tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 行为克隆训练的视觉运动策略对协变量偏移敏感，现有方法如人工校正或数据增强成本高或效果有限。

Method: LPB将专家模仿和OOD恢复解耦为两个模块：基于专家数据的扩散策略和基于专家与次优数据的动态模型。

Result: 实验表明LPB提升了策略鲁棒性和数据效率，无需额外人工校正。

Conclusion: LPB为有限专家数据下的可靠操作提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Visuomotor policies trained via behavior cloning are vulnerable to covariate
shift, where small deviations from expert trajectories can compound into
failure. Common strategies to mitigate this issue involve expanding the
training distribution through human-in-the-loop corrections or synthetic data
augmentation. However, these approaches are often labor-intensive, rely on
strong task assumptions, or compromise the quality of imitation. We introduce
Latent Policy Barrier, a framework for robust visuomotor policy learning.
Inspired by Control Barrier Functions, LPB treats the latent embeddings of
expert demonstrations as an implicit barrier separating safe, in-distribution
states from unsafe, out-of-distribution (OOD) ones. Our approach decouples the
role of precise expert imitation and OOD recovery into two separate modules: a
base diffusion policy solely on expert data, and a dynamics model trained on
both expert and suboptimal policy rollout data. At inference time, the dynamics
model predicts future latent states and optimizes them to stay within the
expert distribution. Both simulated and real-world experiments show that LPB
improves both policy robustness and data efficiency, enabling reliable
manipulation from limited expert data and without additional human correction
or annotation.

Traditions. The project explores two main applications for robots: as guides
supporting inclusive visits for foreign or disabled visitors, and as
telepresence tools allowing people with limited mobility to access museums
remotely. From a research perspective, key topics include storytelling, robot
personality, empathy, personalization, and, in the case of telepresence,
collaboration between the robot and the person, with clearly defined roles and
autonomy.

Abstract: Air-land bimodal vehicles provide a promising solution for navigating complex
environments by combining the flexibility of aerial locomotion with the energy
efficiency of ground mobility. To enhance the robustness of trajectory planning
under environmental disturbances, this paper presents a disturbance-aware
planning framework that incorporates real-time disturbance estimation into both
path searching and trajectory optimization. A key component of the framework is
a disturbance-adaptive safety boundary adjustment mechanism, which dynamically
modifies the vehicle's feasible dynamic boundaries based on estimated
disturbances to ensure trajectory feasibility. Leveraging the dynamics model of
the bimodal vehicle, the proposed approach achieves adaptive and reliable
motion planning across different terrains and operating conditions. A series of
real-world experiments and benchmark comparisons on a custom-built platform
validate the effectiveness and robustness of the method, demonstrating
improvements in tracking accuracy, task efficiency, and energy performance
under both ground and aerial disturbances.

Conclusion: ReNiL为移动和IoT定位提供了可扩展且具有不确定性感知的基础，适用于下一代定位系统。

Abstract: Pedestrian inertial localization is key for mobile and IoT services because
it provides infrastructure-free positioning. Yet most learning-based methods
depend on fixed sliding-window integration, struggle to adapt to diverse motion
scales and cadences, and yield inconsistent uncertainty, limiting real-world
use. We present ReNiL, a Bayesian deep-learning framework for accurate,
efficient, and uncertainty-aware pedestrian localization. ReNiL introduces
Inertial Positioning Demand Points (IPDPs) to estimate motion at contextually
meaningful waypoints instead of dense tracking, and supports inference on IMU
sequences at any scale so cadence can match application needs. It couples a
motion-aware orientation filter with an Any-Scale Laplace Estimator (ASLE), a
dual-task network that blends patch-based self-supervision with Bayesian
regression. By modeling displacements with a Laplace distribution, ReNiL
provides homogeneous Euclidean uncertainty that integrates cleanly with other
sensors. A Bayesian inference chain links successive IPDPs into consistent
trajectories. On RoNIN-ds and a new WUDataset covering indoor and outdoor
motion from 28 participants, ReNiL achieves state-of-the-art displacement
accuracy and uncertainty consistency, outperforming TLIO, CTIN, iMoT, and RoNIN
variants while reducing computation. Application studies further show
robustness and practicality for mobile and IoT localization, making ReNiL a
scalable, uncertainty-aware foundation for next-generation positioning.

Abstract: Human-robot interaction requires robots to process language incrementally,
adapting their actions in real-time based on evolving speech input. Existing
approaches to language-guided robot motion planning typically assume fully
specified instructions, resulting in inefficient stop-and-replan behavior when
corrections or clarifications occur. In this paper, we introduce a novel
reasoning-based incremental parser which integrates an online motion planning
algorithm within the cognitive architecture. Our approach enables continuous
adaptation to dynamic linguistic input, allowing robots to update motion plans
without restarting execution. The incremental parser maintains multiple
candidate parses, leveraging reasoning mechanisms to resolve ambiguities and
revise interpretations when needed. By combining symbolic reasoning with online
motion planning, our system achieves greater flexibility in handling speech
corrections and dynamically changing constraints. We evaluate our framework in
real-world human-robot interaction scenarios, demonstrating online adaptions of
goal poses, constraints, or task objectives. Our results highlight the
advantages of integrating incremental language understanding with real-time
motion planning for natural and fluid human-robot collaboration. The
experiments are demonstrated in the accompanying video at

Result: 在模拟机器人环境中的实验表明，该方法在数据效率上优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了模型预测控制策略的鲁棒性和数据效率。

Abstract: Recent work on visual world models shows significant promise in latent state
dynamics obtained from pre-trained image backbones. However, most of the
current approaches are sensitive to training quality, requiring near-complete
coverage of the action and state space during training to prevent divergence
during inference. To make a model-based planning algorithm more robust to the
quality of the learned world model, we propose in this work to use a
variational autoencoder as a novelty detector to ensure that proposed action
trajectories during planning do not cause the learned model to deviate from the
training data distribution. To evaluate the effectiveness of this approach, a
series of experiments in challenging simulated robot environments was carried
out, with the proposed method incorporated into a model-predictive control
policy loop extending the DINO-WM architecture. The results clearly show that
the proposed method improves over state-of-the-art solutions in terms of data
efficiency.

Conclusion: HyperPM在保持计算效率的同时，提升了动态预测能力，为机器人控制提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Model Predictive Control (MPC) is among the most widely adopted and reliable
methods for robot control, relying critically on an accurate dynamics model.
However, existing dynamics models used in the gradient-based MPC are limited by
computational complexity and state representation. To address this limitation,
we propose the Hyper Prediction Model (HyperPM) - a novel approach in which we
project the unmodeled dynamics onto a time-dependent dynamics model. This
time-dependency is captured through time-varying model parameters, whose
evolution over the MPC prediction horizon is learned using a neural network.
Such formulation preserves the computational efficiency and robustness of the
base model while equipping it with the capacity to anticipate previously
unmodeled phenomena. We evaluated the proposed approach on several challenging
systems, including real-world F1TENTH autonomous racing, and demonstrated that
it significantly reduces long-horizon prediction errors. Moreover, when
integrated within the MPC framework (HyperMPC), our method consistently
outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques.

Conclusion: Affordance-R1首次将GRPO强化学习与推理结合，推动了affordance推理领域的发展。

Abstract: Affordance grounding focuses on predicting the specific regions of objects
that are associated with the actions to be performed by robots. It plays a
vital role in the fields of human-robot interaction, human-object interaction,
embodied manipulation, and embodied perception. Existing models often neglect
the affordance shared among different objects because they lack the
Chain-of-Thought(CoT) reasoning abilities, limiting their out-of-domain (OOD)
generalization and explicit reasoning capabilities. To address these
challenges, we propose Affordance-R1, the first unified affordance grounding
framework that integrates cognitive CoT guided Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) within a reinforcement learning paradigm. Specifically, we
designed a sophisticated affordance function, which contains format,
perception, and cognition rewards to effectively guide optimization directions.
Furthermore, we constructed a high-quality affordance-centric reasoning
dataset, ReasonAff, to support training. Trained exclusively via reinforcement
learning with GRPO and without explicit reasoning data, Affordance-R1 achieves
robust zero-shot generalization and exhibits emergent test-time reasoning
capabilities. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms
well-established methods and exhibits open-world generalization. To the best of
our knowledge, Affordance-R1 is the first to integrate GRPO-based RL with
reasoning into affordance reasoning. The code of our method and our dataset is
released on https://github.com/hq-King/Affordance-R1.

Abstract: Back exoskeletons can reduce musculoskeletal strain, but their effectiveness
depends on support modulation and adaptive control. This study addresses two
challenges: defining optimal support strategies and developing adaptive control
based on payload estimation. We introduce an optimization space based on muscle
activity reduction, perceived discomfort, and user preference, constructing
functions to identify optimal strategies. Experiments with 12 subjects revealed
optimal operating regions, highlighting the need for dynamic modulation. Based
on these insights, we developed a vision-based adaptive control pipeline that
estimates payloads in real-time by enhancing exoskeleton contextual
understanding, minimising latency and enabling support adaptation within the
defined optimisation space. Validation with 12 more subjects showed over 80%
accuracy and improvements across all metrics. Compared to static control,
adaptive modulation reduced peak back muscle activation by up to 23% while
preserving user preference and minimising discomfort. These findings validate
the proposed framework and highlight the potential of intelligent,
context-aware control in industrial exoskeletons.

Abstract: Dynamic obstacle avoidance (DOA) is critical for quadrupedal robots operating
in environments with moving obstacles or humans. Existing approaches typically
rely on navigation-based trajectory replanning, which assumes sufficient
reaction time and leading to fails when obstacles approach rapidly. In such
scenarios, quadrupedal robots require reflexive evasion capabilities to perform
instantaneous, low-latency maneuvers. This paper introduces Reflexive Evasion
Robot (REBot), a control framework that enables quadrupedal robots to achieve
real-time reflexive obstacle avoidance. REBot integrates an avoidance policy
and a recovery policy within a finite-state machine. With carefully designed
learning curricula and by incorporating regularization and adaptive rewards,
REBot achieves robust evasion and rapid stabilization in instantaneous DOA
tasks. We validate REBot through extensive simulations and real-world
experiments, demonstrating notable improvements in avoidance success rates,
energy efficiency, and robustness to fast-moving obstacles. Videos and appendix

Conclusion: ADP无需重新训练即可适配预训练扩散策略，为机器人操作提供了高效且泛化能力强的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion policies have recently emerged as a powerful class of visuomotor
controllers for robot manipulation, offering stable training and expressive
multi-modal action modeling. However, existing approaches typically treat
action generation as an unconstrained denoising process, ignoring valuable a
priori knowledge about geometry and control structure. In this work, we propose
the Adaptive Diffusion Policy (ADP), a test-time adaptation method that
introduces two key inductive biases into the diffusion. First, we embed a
geometric manifold constraint that aligns denoising updates with task-relevant
subspaces, leveraging the fact that the relative pose between the end-effector
and target scene provides a natural gradient direction, and guiding denoising
along the geodesic path of the manipulation manifold. Then, to reduce
unnecessary exploration and accelerate convergence, we propose an analytically
guided initialization: rather than sampling from an uninformative prior, we
compute a rough registration between the gripper and target scenes to propose a
structured initial noisy action. ADP is compatible with pre-trained diffusion
policies and requires no retraining, enabling test-time adaptation that tailors
the policy to specific tasks, thereby enhancing generalization across novel
tasks and environments. Experiments on RLBench, CALVIN, and real-world dataset
show that ADPro, an implementation of ADP, improves success rates,
generalization, and sampling efficiency, achieving up to 25% faster execution
and 9% points over strong diffusion baselines.

Abstract: Existing literature proposes models for estimating the electrical power of

often lack accuracy. To address these issues, we introduce an open source
Matlab-based library designed to automatically generate \ac{ec} models for

validated our methodology by testing on four lightweight robots sourced from

robotic workcells face significant challenges in the analysis of undesired
conditions due to the flexibility of Industry 4.0 that disrupts traditional
quality assurance mechanisms. This paper presents a novel industry-oriented
semantic model called Product-Process-Resource Asset Knowledge Graph (PPR-AKG),
which is designed to analyze and mitigate undesired conditions in flexible
CPPS. Built on top of the well-proven Product-Process-Resource (PPR) model
originating from ISA-95 and VDI-3682, a comprehensive OWL ontology addresses
shortcomings of conventional model-driven engineering for CPPS, particularly
inadequate undesired condition and error handling representation. The
integration of semantic technologies with large language models (LLMs) provides
intuitive interfaces for factory operators, production planners, and engineers
to interact with the entire model using natural language. Evaluation with the
use case addressing electric vehicle battery remanufacturing demonstrates that
the PPR-AKG approach efficiently supports resource allocation based on
explicitly represented capabilities as well as identification and mitigation of
undesired conditions in production. The key contributions include (1) a
holistic PPR-AKG model capturing multi-dimensional production knowledge, and
(2) the useful combination of the PPR-AKG with LLM-based chatbots for human
interaction.

TL;DR: S-Path利用3D场景图的语义结构提升路径规划效率和可解释性，通过两阶段规划和子问题并行求解，显著减少规划时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D场景图的语义结构未被充分利用以提升路径规划效率和可解释性。

Method: 两阶段规划：先在语义图上搜索高层路径，再分解为并行子问题；引入重规划机制。

Result: 实验显示规划时间平均减少5.7倍，路径最优性与传统方法相当，复杂场景表现更优。

Conclusion: S-Path是高效且可解释的路径规划方法，适用于3D场景图环境。

Abstract: 3D Scene Graphs integrate both metric and semantic information, yet their
structure remains underutilized for improving path planning efficiency and
interpretability. In this work, we present S-Path, a situationally-aware path
planner that leverages the metric-semantic structure of indoor 3D Scene Graphs
to significantly enhance planning efficiency. S-Path follows a two-stage
process: it first performs a search over a semantic graph derived from the
scene graph to yield a human-understandable high-level path. This also
identifies relevant regions for planning, which later allows the decomposition
of the problem into smaller, independent subproblems that can be solved in
parallel. We also introduce a replanning mechanism that, in the event of an
infeasible path, reuses information from previously solved subproblems to
update semantic heuristics and prioritize reuse to further improve the
efficiency of future planning attempts. Extensive experiments on both
real-world and simulated environments show that S-Path achieves average
reductions of 5.7x in planning time while maintaining comparable path
optimality to classical sampling-based planners and surpassing them in complex
scenarios, making it an efficient and interpretable path planner for
environments represented by indoor 3D Scene Graphs.

Abstract: A metric-accurate semantic 3D representation is essential for many robotic
tasks. This work proposes a simple, yet powerful, way to integrate the 2D
embeddings of a Vision-Language Model in a metric-accurate 3D representation at
real-time. We combine a local embedding masking strategy, for a more distinct
embedding distribution, with a confidence-weighted 3D integration for more
reliable 3D embeddings. The resulting metric-accurate embedding representation
is task-agnostic and can represent semantic concepts on a global multi-room, as
well as on a local object-level. This enables a variety of interactive robotic
applications that require the localisation of objects-of-interest via natural
language. We evaluate our approach on a variety of real-world sequences and
demonstrate that these strategies achieve a more accurate object-of-interest
localisation while improving the runtime performance in order to meet our
real-time constraints. We further demonstrate the versatility of our approach
in a variety of interactive handheld, mobile robotics and manipulation tasks,
requiring only raw image data.

Abstract: The code performance of industrial robots is typically analyzed through CPU
metrics, which overlook the physical impact of code on robot behavior. This
study introduces a novel framework for assessing robot program performance from
an embodiment perspective by analyzing the robot's electrical power profile.
Our approach diverges from conventional CPU based evaluations and instead
leverages a suite of normalized metrics, namely, the energy utilization
coefficient, the energy conversion metric, and the reliability coefficient, to
capture how efficiently and reliably energy is used during task execution.
Complementing these metrics, the established robot wear metric provides further
insight into long term reliability. Our approach is demonstrated through an
experimental case study in machine tending, comparing four programs with
diverse strategies using a UR5e robot. The proposed metrics directly compare
and categorize different robot programs, regardless of the specific task, by
linking code performance to its physical manifestation through power
consumption patterns. Our results reveal the strengths and weaknesses of each
strategy, offering actionable insights for optimizing robot programming
practices. Enhancing energy efficiency and reliability through this embodiment
centric approach not only improves individual robot performance but also
supports broader industrial objectives such as sustainable manufacturing and
cost reduction.

Conclusion: 研究表明，基于VDC的增强EMLA模型能够实现全电动HDRM的模块化实时控制，为其在下一代移动工作机器中的应用提供了支持。

Abstract: This paper presents a unified system-level modeling and control framework for
an all-electric heavy-duty robotic manipulator (HDRM) driven by
electromechanical linear actuators (EMLAs). A surrogate-enhanced actuator
model, combining integrated electromechanical dynamics with a neural network
trained on a dedicated testbed, is integrated into an extended virtual
decomposition control (VDC) architecture augmented by a natural adaptation law.
The derived analytical HDRM model supports a hierarchical control structure
that seamlessly maps high-level force and velocity objectives to real-time
actuator commands, accompanied by a Lyapunov-based stability proof. In
multi-domain simulations of both cubic and a custom planar triangular
trajectory, the proposed adaptive modular controller achieves sub-centimeter
Cartesian tracking accuracy. Experimental validation of the same 1-DoF platform
under realistic load emulation confirms the efficacy of the proposed control
strategy. These findings demonstrate that a surrogate-enhanced EMLA model
embedded in the VDC approach can enable modular, real-time control of an
all-electric HDRM, supporting its deployment in next-generation mobile working
machines.

Conclusion: 重新平衡数据集是提升模仿学习性能的有效方法，但不同方法各有利弊，需根据场景选择。

Abstract: Robots should be able to learn complex behaviors from human demonstrations.
In practice, these human-provided datasets are inevitably imbalanced: i.e., the
human demonstrates some subtasks more frequently than others. State-of-the-art
methods default to treating each element of the human's dataset as equally
important. So if -- for instance -- the majority of the human's data focuses on
reaching a goal, and only a few state-action pairs move to avoid an obstacle,
the learning algorithm will place greater emphasis on goal reaching. More
generally, misalignment between the relative amounts of data and the importance
of that data causes fundamental problems for imitation learning approaches. In
this paper we analyze and develop learning methods that automatically account
for mixed datasets. We formally prove that imbalanced data leads to imbalanced
policies when each state-action pair is weighted equally; these policies
emulate the most represented behaviors, and not the human's complex, multi-task
demonstrations. We next explore algorithms that rebalance offline datasets
(i.e., reweight the importance of different state-action pairs) without human
oversight. Reweighting the dataset can enhance the overall policy performance.
However, there is no free lunch: each method for autonomously rebalancing
brings its own pros and cons. We formulate these advantages and disadvantages,
helping other researchers identify when each type of approach is most
appropriate. We conclude by introducing a novel meta-gradient rebalancing
algorithm that addresses the primary limitations behind existing approaches.
Our experiments show that dataset rebalancing leads to better downstream
learning, improving the performance of general imitation learning algorithms
without requiring additional data collection. See our project website:

Motivation: 现有外参标定方法依赖结构化目标或完全激励数据，限制了实际应用；在线标定因弱激励导致估计不可靠。

Result: 在无人机、地面机器人和手持设备上验证，优于传统优化方法，弱激励下仍能高精度标定。

Conclusion: 框架简化了多样化机器人平台的部署，无需高质量初始外参，可从常规操作数据中完成标定。

Abstract: Extrinsic calibration is essential for multi-sensor fusion, existing methods
rely on structured targets or fully-excited data, limiting real-world
applicability. Online calibration further suffers from weak excitation, leading
to unreliable estimates. To address these limitations, we propose a
reinforcement learning (RL)-based extrinsic calibration framework that
formulates extrinsic calibration as a decision-making problem, directly
optimizes $SE(3)$ extrinsics to enhance odometry accuracy. Our approach
leverages a probabilistic Bingham distribution to model 3D rotations, ensuring
stable optimization while inherently retaining quaternion symmetry. A
trajectory alignment reward mechanism enables robust calibration without
structured targets by quantitatively evaluating estimated tightly-coupled
trajectory against a reference trajectory. Additionally, an automated data
selection module filters uninformative samples, significantly improving
efficiency and scalability for large-scale datasets. Extensive experiments on
UAVs, UGVs, and handheld platforms demonstrate that our method outperforms
traditional optimization-based approaches, achieving high-precision calibration
even under weak excitation conditions. Our framework simplifies deployment on
diverse robotic platforms by eliminating the need for high-quality initial
extrinsics and enabling calibration from routine operating data. The code is

Conclusion: V*通过直接整合动态约束和高维搜索优化，实现了无需后处理的动态可行轨迹规划。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicle navigation in structured environments requires planners
capable of generating time-optimal, collision-free trajectories that satisfy
dynamic and kinematic constraints. We introduce V*, a graph-based motion
planner that represents speed and direction as explicit state variables within
a discretised space-time-velocity lattice. Unlike traditional methods that
decouple spatial search from dynamic feasibility or rely on post-hoc smoothing,
V* integrates both motion dimensions directly into graph construction through
dynamic graph generation during search expansion. To manage the complexity of
high-dimensional search, we employ a hexagonal discretisation strategy and
provide formal mathematical proofs establishing optimal waypoint spacing and
minimal node redundancy under constrained heading transitions for
velocity-aware motion planning. We develop a mathematical formulation for
transient steering dynamics in the kinematic bicycle model, modelling steering
angle convergence with exponential behaviour, and deriving the relationship for
convergence rate parameters. This theoretical foundation, combined with
geometric pruning strategies that eliminate expansions leading to infeasible
steering configurations, enables V* to evaluate dynamically admissible
manoeuvres, ensuring each trajectory is physically realisable without further
refinement. We further demonstrate V*'s performance in simulation studies with
cluttered and dynamic environments involving moving obstacles, showing its
ability to avoid conflicts, yield proactively, and generate safe, efficient
trajectories with temporal reasoning capabilities for waiting behaviours and
dynamic coordination.

Abstract: Generalist robot policies trained on large-scale datasets such as Open
X-Embodiment (OXE) demonstrate strong performance across a wide range of tasks.
However, they often struggle to generalize beyond the distribution of their
training data. In this paper, we investigate the underlying cause of this
limited generalization capability. We identify shortcut learning -- the
reliance on task-irrelevant features -- as a key impediment to generalization.
Through comprehensive theoretical and empirical analysis, we uncover two
primary contributors to shortcut learning: (1) limited diversity within
individual sub-datasets, and (2) significant distributional disparities across
sub-datasets, leading to dataset fragmentation. These issues arise from the
inherent structure of large-scale datasets like OXE, which are typically
composed of multiple sub-datasets collected independently across varied
environments and embodiments. Our findings provide critical insights into
dataset collection strategies that can reduce shortcut learning and enhance the
generalization ability of generalist robot policies. Moreover, in scenarios
where acquiring new large-scale data is impractical, we demonstrate that
carefully selected robotic data augmentation strategies can effectively reduce
shortcut learning in existing offline datasets, thereby improving
generalization capabilities of generalist robot policies, e.g., $\pi_0$, in
both simulation and real-world environments. More information at
