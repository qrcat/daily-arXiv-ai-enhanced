Second, we analyze\nthe internal behavior of vision reflection and find that the vision-language\nconnector maps visual features into explicit textual concepts, allowing the\nlanguage model to reason about prediction plausibility using commonsense\nknowledge. We further observe that replacing a large number of vision tokens\nwith only a few text tokens still enables LLaVA to generate similar answers,\nsuggesting that LMMs may rely primarily on a compact set of distilled textual\nrepresentations rather than raw vision features. Third, we show that a\ntraining-free connector can enhance LMM performance in fine-grained recognition\ntasks, without extensive feature-alignment training. Together, these findings\noffer new insights into the explainability of vision-language models and\nsuggest that vision reflection is a promising strategy for achieving robust and\ninterpretable visual recognition."}

(ii) we propose\nGrasp-LLaVA, a Grasp Vision Language Model enabling human-like reasoning to\ninfer the suitable grasp type estimate based on the object's physical\ncharacteristics resulting in a significant 50.2% accuracy over unseen object\ntypes compared to 36.7% accuracy of an SOTA grasp estimation model.\n  Lastly, to bridge the performance-latency gap, we propose Hybrid Grasp\nNetwork (HGN), an edge-cloud deployment infrastructure enabling fast grasp\nestimation on edge and accurate cloud inference as a fail-safe, effectively\nexpanding the latency vs. accuracy Pareto. HGN with confidence calibration (DC)\nenables dynamic switching between edge and cloud models, improving semantic\nprojection accuracy by 5.6% (to 42.3%) with 3.5x speedup over the unseen object\ntypes. Over a real-world sample mix, it reaches 86% average accuracy (12.2%\ngain over edge-only), and 2.2x faster inference than Grasp-LLaVA alone."}

Conversely, robots may seek human\nconfirmation for anomalous events or require help recovering from motion or\nplanning failures. To enable such bilateral, context-aware interactions under\nrestricted communication, this work proposes MoRoCo, a unified framework for\nonline coordination and exploration in multi-operator, multi-robot systems.\nMoRoCo enables the team to adaptively switch among three coordination modes:\nspread mode for parallelized exploration with intermittent data sharing,\nmigrate mode for coordinated relocation, and chain mode for maintaining\nhigh-bandwidth connectivity through multi-hop links.

These words are then incorporate into predefined\nprompt templates and encoded as prompt embeddings. Next, a Mamba-based mapping\nnetwork is designed to quickly map image embeddings extracted by CLIP to\nvisual-text embeddings. Finally, the resulting prompt embeddings and\nvisual-text embeddings are concatenated to form textual-enriched feature\nembeddings, which are fed into a GPT-2 model for caption generation. Extensive\nexperiments conducted on the widely used MS-COCO dataset show that the RORPCap\nrequires only 2.6 hours under cross-entropy loss training, achieving 120.5%\nCIDEr score and 22.0% SPICE score on the \"Karpathy\" test split. RORPCap\nachieves comparable performance metrics to detector-based and GCN-based models\nwith the shortest training time and demonstrates its potential as an\nalternative for image captioning."}

We propose\nSOFA (Simulating and Optimizing Atrial Fibrillation Ablation), a novel\ndeep-learning framework that addresses these questions.

To our best knowledge, it is the first comprehensive dataset\ndesigned for unified SVG generation (from textual prompts and images) and SVG\nunderstanding (color, category, usage, etc.). As expected, learning on the\nproposed dataset boosts open-source MLLMs' performance on various SVG U&G\ntasks, surpassing SOTA close-source MLLMs like GPT-4V. We release dataset,\nbenchmark, weights, codes and experiment details on\nhttps://ryanlijinke.github.io/."}

We argue that an effective defense\nnot only distorts forged content but also blocks the model's ability to adapt,\nwhich occurs when attackers retrain their models on protected images. To\nachieve this, we propose an innovative Two-Stage Defense Framework (TSDF).\nBenefiting from the intensity separation mechanism designed in this paper, the\nframework uses dual-function adversarial perturbations to perform two roles.\nFirst, it can directly distort the forged results.

To bridge this, we introduce Next Shot Generation\n(NSG): synthesizing a subsequent, high-quality shot that critically conforms to\nprofessional editing patterns while upholding rigorous cinematic continuity.\nOur framework, Cut2Next, leverages a Diffusion Transformer (DiT). It employs\nin-context tuning guided by a novel Hierarchical Multi-Prompting strategy. This\nstrategy uses Relational Prompts to define overall context and inter-shot\nediting styles. Individual Prompts then specify per-shot content and\ncinematographic attributes. Together, these guide Cut2Next to generate\ncinematically appropriate next shots. Architectural innovations, Context-Aware\nCondition Injection (CACI) and Hierarchical Attention Mask (HAM), further\nintegrate these diverse signals without introducing new parameters. We\nconstruct RawCuts (large-scale) and CuratedCuts (refined) datasets, both with\nhierarchical prompts, and introduce CutBench for evaluation. Experiments show\nCut2Next excels in visual consistency and text fidelity. Crucially, user\nstudies reveal a strong preference for Cut2Next, particularly for its adherence\nto intended editing patterns and overall cinematic continuity, validating its\nability to generate high-quality, narratively expressive, and cinematically\ncoherent subsequent shots."}

This paper presents StableAvatar, the first end-to-end video\ndiffusion transformer that synthesizes infinite-length high-quality videos\nwithout post-processing. Conditioned on a reference image and audio,\nStableAvatar integrates tailored training and inference modules to enable\ninfinite-length video generation. We observe that the main reason preventing\nexisting models from generating long videos lies in their audio modeling. They\ntypically rely on third-party off-the-shelf extractors to obtain audio\nembeddings, which are then directly injected into the diffusion model via\ncross-attention. Since current diffusion backbones lack any audio-related\npriors, this approach causes severe latent distribution error accumulation\nacross video clips, leading the latent distribution of subsequent segments to\ndrift away from the optimal distribution gradually. To address this,\nStableAvatar introduces a novel Time-step-aware Audio Adapter that prevents\nerror accumulation via time-step-aware modulation. During inference, we propose\na novel Audio Native Guidance Mechanism to further enhance the audio\nsynchronization by leveraging the diffusion's own evolving joint audio-latent\nprediction as a dynamic guidance signal. To enhance the smoothness of the\ninfinite-length videos, we introduce a Dynamic Weighted Sliding-window Strategy\nthat fuses latent over time. Experiments on benchmarks show the effectiveness\nof StableAvatar both qualitatively and quantitatively."}

However, inherent challenges such as\nspeckle noise, needle-like artifacts, and low image resolution make robust\nneedle detection difficult, particularly when visibility is reduced or lost. In\nthis paper, we propose a method to restore needle alignment when the ultrasound\nimaging plane and the needle insertion plane are misaligned. Unlike many\nexisting approaches that rely heavily on needle visibility in ultrasound\nimages, our method uses a more robust feature by periodically vibrating the\nneedle using a mechanical system. Specifically, we propose a vibration-based\nenergy metric that remains effective even when the needle is fully out of\nplane. Using this metric, we develop a control strategy to reposition the\nultrasound probe in response to misalignments between the imaging plane and the\nneedle insertion plane in both translation and rotation.
