### [1] [Med-GRIM: Enhanced Zero-Shot Medical VQA using prompt-embedded Multimodal Graph RAG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06496)
*Rakesh Raj Madavan,Akshat Kaimal,Hashim Faisal,Chandrakala S*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BIND和Med-GRIM通过密集编码和图检索技术提升医疗VQA任务的精度和效率，避免了高计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VQA模型在复杂领域（如医疗）中缺乏精确性，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 结合密集编码和对比预训练技术，设计Med-GRIM模型，采用图检索和提示工程集成领域知识。

Result: Med-GRIM以低计算成本实现高性能，并发布DermaGraph数据集支持零样本研究。

Conclusion: BIND和Med-GRIM为医疗VQA提供了高效、精确的解决方案，并推动了相关研究。

Abstract: An ensemble of trained multimodal encoders and vision-language models (VLMs)
has become a standard approach for visual question answering (VQA) tasks.
However, such models often fail to produce responses with the detailed
precision necessary for complex, domain-specific applications such as medical
VQA. Our representation model, BIND: BLIVA Integrated with Dense Encoding,
extends prior multimodal work by refining the joint embedding space through
dense, query-token-based encodings inspired by contrastive pretraining
techniques. This refined encoder powers Med-GRIM, a model designed for medical
VQA tasks that leverages graph-based retrieval and prompt engineering to
integrate domain-specific knowledge. Rather than relying on compute-heavy
fine-tuning of vision and language models on specific datasets, Med-GRIM
applies a low-compute, modular workflow with small language models (SLMs) for
efficiency. Med-GRIM employs prompt-based retrieval to dynamically inject
relevant knowledge, ensuring both accuracy and robustness in its responses. By
assigning distinct roles to each agent within the VQA system, Med-GRIM achieves
large language model performance at a fraction of the computational cost.
Additionally, to support scalable research in zero-shot multimodal medical
applications, we introduce DermaGraph, a novel Graph-RAG dataset comprising
diverse dermatological conditions. This dataset facilitates both multimodal and
unimodal querying. The code and dataset are available at:

### [2] [DiTalker: A Unified DiT-based Framework for High-Quality and Speaking Styles Controllable Portrait Animation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06511)
*He Feng,Yongjia Ma,Donglin Di,Lei Fan,Tonghua Su,Xiangqian Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiTalker是一个基于DiT的统一框架，用于可控说话风格的人像动画，通过分离音频和风格特征，优化唇同步和细节保留。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注唇同步或静态情感转换，忽略了动态风格（如头部运动），且双U-Net架构计算开销大。

Method: 设计了风格-情感编码模块和音频-风格融合模块，通过并行交叉注意力层解耦音频与风格，并采用优化约束提升结果质量。

Result: 实验表明DiTalker在唇同步和说话风格可控性上表现优越。

Conclusion: DiTalker通过统一框架解决了动态风格和计算效率问题，实现了高质量的人像动画。

Abstract: Portrait animation aims to synthesize talking videos from a static reference
face, conditioned on audio and style frame cues (e.g., emotion and head poses),
while ensuring precise lip synchronization and faithful reproduction of
speaking styles. Existing diffusion-based portrait animation methods primarily
focus on lip synchronization or static emotion transformation, often
overlooking dynamic styles such as head movements. Moreover, most of these
methods rely on a dual U-Net architecture, which preserves identity consistency
but incurs additional computational overhead. To this end, we propose DiTalker,
a unified DiT-based framework for speaking style-controllable portrait
animation. We design a Style-Emotion Encoding Module that employs two separate
branches: a style branch extracting identity-specific style information (e.g.,
head poses and movements), and an emotion branch extracting identity-agnostic
emotion features. We further introduce an Audio-Style Fusion Module that
decouples audio and speaking styles via two parallel cross-attention layers,
using these features to guide the animation process. To enhance the quality of
results, we adopt and modify two optimization constraints: one to improve lip
synchronization and the other to preserve fine-grained identity and background
details. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of DiTalker in terms
of lip synchronization and speaking style controllability. Project Page:

### [3] [VOccl3D: A Video Benchmark Dataset for 3D Human Pose and Shape Estimation under real Occlusions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06757)
*Yash Garg,Saketh Bachu,Arindam Dutta,Rohit Lal,Sarosij Bose,Calvin-Khang Ta,M. Salman Asif,Amit Roy-Chowdhury*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出VOccl3D数据集，填补现有遮挡数据集的不足，通过改进HPS方法在遮挡场景下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有HPS方法在复杂姿势或严重遮挡下表现不佳，且现有遮挡数据集缺乏真实性。

Method: 使用计算机图形渲染技术构建VOccl3D数据集，并微调CLIFF和BEDLAM-CLIFF方法。

Result: 在多个公共数据集及自建测试集上显著提升性能，并改进YOLO11检测器。

Conclusion: VOccl3D为遮挡研究提供了更真实的基准资源。

Abstract: Human pose and shape (HPS) estimation methods have been extensively studied,
with many demonstrating high zero-shot performance on in-the-wild images and
videos. However, these methods often struggle in challenging scenarios
involving complex human poses or significant occlusions. Although some studies
address 3D human pose estimation under occlusion, they typically evaluate
performance on datasets that lack realistic or substantial occlusions, e.g.,
most existing datasets introduce occlusions with random patches over the human
or clipart-style overlays, which may not reflect real-world challenges. To
bridge this gap in realistic occlusion datasets, we introduce a novel benchmark
dataset, VOccl3D, a Video-based human Occlusion dataset with 3D body pose and
shape annotations. Inspired by works such as AGORA and BEDLAM, we constructed
this dataset using advanced computer graphics rendering techniques,
incorporating diverse real-world occlusion scenarios, clothing textures, and
human motions. Additionally, we fine-tuned recent HPS methods, CLIFF and
BEDLAM-CLIFF, on our dataset, demonstrating significant qualitative and
quantitative improvements across multiple public datasets, as well as on the
test split of our dataset, while comparing its performance with other
state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we leveraged our dataset to enhance
human detection performance under occlusion by fine-tuning an existing object
detector, YOLO11, thus leading to a robust end-to-end HPS estimation system
under occlusions. Overall, this dataset serves as a valuable resource for
future research aimed at benchmarking methods designed to handle occlusions,
offering a more realistic alternative to existing occlusion datasets. See the

### [4] [BigTokDetect: A Clinically-Informed Vision-Language Model Framework for Detecting Pro-Bigorexia Videos on TikTok](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06515)
*Minh Duc Chu,Kshitij Pawar,Zihao He,Roxanna Sharifi,Ross Sonnenblick,Magdalayna Curry,Laura D'Adamo,Lindsay Young,Stuart B Murray,Kristina Lerman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出BigTokDetect框架，用于检测TikTok上促进肌肉变形行为的危害内容，通过多模态融合提升检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体难以检测伪装成健身内容的肌肉变形行为危害内容，传统文本检测方法效果有限。

Method: 开发BigTokDetect框架，使用专家标注的多模态数据集BigTok（2200+视频），结合视觉语言模型进行检测。

Result: 在多模态融合下，主分类准确率达82.9%，子分类达69%，视频特征表现最佳。

Conclusion: 研究为心理健康领域的内容审核提供了新工具和方法框架。

Abstract: Social media platforms increasingly struggle to detect harmful content that
promotes muscle dysmorphic behaviors, particularly pro-bigorexia content that
disproportionately affects adolescent males. Unlike traditional eating disorder
detection focused on the "thin ideal," pro-bigorexia material masquerades as
legitimate fitness content through complex multimodal combinations of visual
displays, coded language, and motivational messaging that evade text-based
detection systems. We address this challenge by developing BigTokDetect, a
clinically-informed detection framework for identifying pro-bigorexia content
on TikTok. We introduce BigTok, the first expert-annotated multimodal dataset
of over 2,200 TikTok videos labeled by clinical psychologists and psychiatrists
across five primary categories spanning body image, nutrition, exercise,
supplements, and masculinity. Through a comprehensive evaluation of
state-of-the-art vision language models, we achieve 0.829% accuracy on primary
category classification and 0.690% on subcategory detection via domain-specific
finetuning. Our ablation studies demonstrate that multimodal fusion improves
performance by 5-10% over text-only approaches, with video features providing
the most discriminative signals. These findings establish new benchmarks for
multimodal harmful content detection and provide both the computational tools
and methodological framework needed for scalable content moderation in
specialized mental health domains.

### [5] [DiffUS: Differentiable Ultrasound Rendering from Volumetric Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06768)
*Noe Bertramo,Gabriel Duguey,Vivek Gopalakrishnan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiffUS是一种基于物理的可微分超声渲染器，用于从MRI/CT数据生成逼真的B模式超声图像，以解决术中超声与术前影像对齐问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 术中超声成像存在噪声、伪影和与术前MRI/CT对齐困难的问题，DiffUS旨在填补术前规划与术中引导之间的差距。

Method: DiffUS通过机器学习将MRI 3D扫描转换为声阻抗体积，利用射线追踪模拟超声束传播，并通过稀疏线性系统捕捉多次内部反射，最终生成包含噪声和伪影的B模式图像。

Result: 在ReMIND数据集上验证，DiffUS能够从脑部MRI数据生成解剖学准确的超声图像。

Conclusion: DiffUS作为一种可微分工具，为下游应用（如切片到体积配准）提供了优化潜力。

Abstract: Intraoperative ultrasound imaging provides real-time guidance during numerous
surgical procedures, but its interpretation is complicated by noise, artifacts,
and poor alignment with high-resolution preoperative MRI/CT scans. To bridge
the gap between reoperative planning and intraoperative guidance, we present
DiffUS, a physics-based, differentiable ultrasound renderer that synthesizes
realistic B-mode images from volumetric imaging. DiffUS first converts MRI 3D
scans into acoustic impedance volumes using a machine learning approach. Next,
we simulate ultrasound beam propagation using ray tracing with coupled
reflection-transmission equations. DiffUS formulates wave propagation as a
sparse linear system that captures multiple internal reflections. Finally, we
reconstruct B-mode images via depth-resolved echo extraction across fan-shaped
acquisition geometry, incorporating realistic artifacts including speckle noise
and depth-dependent degradation. DiffUS is entirely implemented as
differentiable tensor operations in PyTorch, enabling gradient-based
optimization for downstream applications such as slice-to-volume registration
and volumetric reconstruction. Evaluation on the ReMIND dataset demonstrates
DiffUS's ability to generate anatomically accurate ultrasound images from brain
MRI data.

### [6] [Frequency Prior Guided Matching: A Data Augmentation Approach for Generalizable Semi-Supervised Polyp Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06517)
*Haoran Xi,Chen Liu,Xiaolin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FPGM是一种基于频率先验的半监督学习方法，通过利用息肉边缘的频率特征，显著提升了跨域分割的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决息肉分割中标注数据不足和域适应性能下降的问题。

Method: 提出FPGM框架，分两阶段：学习域不变频率先验，并对未标注图像进行频谱扰动对齐。

Result: 在六个公开数据集上表现最优，零样本泛化能力显著提升。

Conclusion: FPGM为临床部署提供了高效且鲁棒的息肉分割解决方案。

Abstract: Automated polyp segmentation is essential for early diagnosis of colorectal
cancer, yet developing robust models remains challenging due to limited
annotated data and significant performance degradation under domain shift.
Although semi-supervised learning (SSL) reduces annotation requirements,
existing methods rely on generic augmentations that ignore polyp-specific
structural properties, resulting in poor generalization to new imaging centers
and devices. To address this, we introduce Frequency Prior Guided Matching
(FPGM), a novel augmentation framework built on a key discovery: polyp edges
exhibit a remarkably consistent frequency signature across diverse datasets.
FPGM leverages this intrinsic regularity in a two-stage process. It first
learns a domain-invariant frequency prior from the edge regions of labeled
polyps. Then, it performs principled spectral perturbations on unlabeled
images, aligning their amplitude spectra with this learned prior while
preserving phase information to maintain structural integrity. This targeted
alignment normalizes domain-specific textural variations, thereby compelling
the model to learn the underlying, generalizable anatomical structure.
Validated on six public datasets, FPGM establishes a new state-of-the-art
against ten competing methods. It demonstrates exceptional zero-shot
generalization capabilities, achieving over 10% absolute gain in Dice score in
data-scarce scenarios. By significantly enhancing cross-domain robustness, FPGM
presents a powerful solution for clinically deployable polyp segmentation under
limited supervision.

### [7] [Evaluating Fisheye-Compatible 3D Gaussian Splatting Methods on Real Images Beyond 180 Degree Field of View](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06968)
*Ulas Gunes,Matias Turkulainen,Juho Kannala,Esa Rahtu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 评估了Fisheye-GS和3DGUT在超过180度视场的真实图像上的表现，分析了极端畸变的处理能力，并提出了一种基于深度的初始化策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究鱼眼相机在极端畸变下的3D高斯泼溅方法性能，解决SfM初始化在高畸变场景中的局限性。

Method: 通过不同视场（200度、160度、120度）评估性能，提出基于UniK3D预测的深度初始化策略。

Result: Fisheye-GS在160度视场表现最佳，3DGUT在200度视场保持稳定；UniK3D策略在困难场景中表现与SfM相当。

Conclusion: 鱼眼3DGS方法在稀疏和畸变严重的图像输入下具有实际可行性。

Abstract: We present the first evaluation of fisheye-based 3D Gaussian Splatting
methods, Fisheye-GS and 3DGUT, on real images with fields of view exceeding 180
degree. Our study covers both indoor and outdoor scenes captured with 200
degree fisheye cameras and analyzes how each method handles extreme distortion
in real world settings. We evaluate performance under varying fields of view
(200 degree, 160 degree, and 120 degree) to study the tradeoff between
peripheral distortion and spatial coverage. Fisheye-GS benefits from field of
view (FoV) reduction, particularly at 160 degree, while 3DGUT remains stable
across all settings and maintains high perceptual quality at the full 200
degree view. To address the limitations of SfM-based initialization, which
often fails under strong distortion, we also propose a depth-based strategy
using UniK3D predictions from only 2-3 fisheye images per scene. Although
UniK3D is not trained on real fisheye data, it produces dense point clouds that
enable reconstruction quality on par with SfM, even in difficult scenes with
fog, glare, or sky. Our results highlight the practical viability of
fisheye-based 3DGS methods for wide-angle 3D reconstruction from sparse and
distortion-heavy image inputs.

### [8] [Large Language Models Facilitate Vision Reflection in Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06525)
*Guoyuan An,JaeYoon Kim,SungEui Yoon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型多模态模型（LMMs）中视觉反射的可解释性，发现通过提示LMM验证专用视觉模型的预测可提高准确性，并分析了其内部行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LMMs在视觉任务中的表现及其可解释性，探索如何通过视觉反射提升模型性能。

Method: 通过提示LMM验证视觉模型的预测，分析其内部行为，并测试训练无关的连接器在细粒度识别任务中的效果。

Result: LMMs通过将视觉特征映射为文本概念进行推理，少量文本标记即可生成相似答案，训练无关连接器可提升性能。

Conclusion: 视觉反射是实现稳健且可解释视觉识别的有效策略，为LMMs的可解释性提供了新见解。

Abstract: This paper presents several novel findings on the explainability of vision
reflection in large multimodal models (LMMs). First, we show that prompting an
LMM to verify the prediction of a specialized vision model can improve
recognition accuracy, even on benchmarks like ImageNet, despite prior evidence
that LMMs typically underperform dedicated vision encoders. Second, we analyze
the internal behavior of vision reflection and find that the vision-language
connector maps visual features into explicit textual concepts, allowing the
language model to reason about prediction plausibility using commonsense
knowledge. We further observe that replacing a large number of vision tokens
with only a few text tokens still enables LLaVA to generate similar answers,
suggesting that LMMs may rely primarily on a compact set of distilled textual
representations rather than raw vision features. Third, we show that a
training-free connector can enhance LMM performance in fine-grained recognition
tasks, without extensive feature-alignment training. Together, these findings
offer new insights into the explainability of vision-language models and
suggest that vision reflection is a promising strategy for achieving robust and
interpretable visual recognition.

### [9] [HiMat: DiT-based Ultra-High Resolution SVBRDF Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07011)
*Zixiong Wang,Jian Yang,Yiwei Hu,Milos Hasan,Beibei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HiMat是一个高效扩散框架，用于生成4K分辨率的SVBRDF，通过轻量级CrossStitch模块保持多图一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率文本到图像生成模型（如DiT）的兴起为SVBRDF生成提供了机会，但如何高效生成多图对齐的SVBRDF仍具挑战。

Method: 提出HiMat框架，引入轻量级CrossStitch模块捕捉图间依赖，不显著改变DiT主干。

Result: 实验证明HiMat能生成结构一致且高频细节丰富的4K SVBRDF，并可推广至本征分解任务。

Conclusion: HiMat通过轻量级设计高效生成高质量SVBRDF，展示了扩散模型在复杂生成任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Creating highly detailed SVBRDFs is essential for 3D content creation. The
rise of high-resolution text-to-image generative models, based on diffusion
transformers (DiT), suggests an opportunity to finetune them for this task.
However, retargeting the models to produce multiple aligned SVBRDF maps instead
of just RGB images, while achieving high efficiency and ensuring consistency
across different maps, remains a challenge. In this paper, we introduce HiMat:
a memory- and computation-efficient diffusion-based framework capable of
generating native 4K-resolution SVBRDFs. A key challenge we address is
maintaining consistency across different maps in a lightweight manner, without
relying on training new VAEs or significantly altering the DiT backbone (which
would damage its prior capabilities). To tackle this, we introduce the
CrossStitch module, a lightweight convolutional module that captures inter-map
dependencies through localized operations. Its weights are initialized such
that the DiT backbone operation is unchanged before finetuning starts. HiMat
enables generation with strong structural coherence and high-frequency details.
Results with a large set of text prompts demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach for 4K SVBRDF generation. Further experiments suggest generalization
to tasks such as intrinsic decomposition.

### [10] [A Framework Combining 3D CNN and Transformer for Video-Based Behavior Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06528)
*Xiuliang Zhang,Tadiwa Elisha Nyamasvisva,Chuntao Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合3D CNN和Transformer的混合框架，用于视频行为识别，解决了传统方法在长程依赖和高计算成本上的不足，并在基准数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频行为识别在公共安全等领域至关重要，但传统3D CNN难以建模长程依赖，而Transformer计算成本高，需结合两者优势。

Method: 设计混合框架：3D CNN提取局部时空特征，Transformer捕获长程依赖，通过融合机制整合两种表示。

Result: 在基准数据集上优于传统3D CNN和单独Transformer，识别精度更高且复杂度可控。

Conclusion: 混合框架为视频行为识别提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案，验证了两种模块的互补性。

Abstract: Video-based behavior recognition is essential in fields such as public
safety, intelligent surveillance, and human-computer interaction. Traditional
3D Convolutional Neural Network (3D CNN) effectively capture local
spatiotemporal features but struggle with modeling long-range dependencies.
Conversely, Transformers excel at learning global contextual information but
face challenges with high computational costs. To address these limitations, we
propose a hybrid framework combining 3D CNN and Transformer architectures. The
3D CNN module extracts low-level spatiotemporal features, while the Transformer
module captures long-range temporal dependencies, with a fusion mechanism
integrating both representations. Evaluated on benchmark datasets, the proposed
model outperforms traditional 3D CNN and standalone Transformers, achieving
higher recognition accuracy with manageable complexity. Ablation studies
further validate the complementary strengths of the two modules. This hybrid
framework offers an effective and scalable solution for video-based behavior
recognition.

TL;DR: Matrix-3D是一个利用全景表示生成可探索3D世界的框架，结合了条件视频生成和全景3D重建，解决了现有方法生成场景范围有限的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在生成3D场景时范围有限，Matrix-3D旨在通过全景表示实现更广泛的覆盖范围。

Method: 1. 训练轨迹引导的全景视频扩散模型；2. 提出两种方法将全景视频提升为3D世界：前馈式大范围重建模型和基于优化的重建流程。

Result: 实验表明，Matrix-3D在全景视频生成和3D世界生成方面达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: Matrix-3D通过全景表示和两种重建方法，实现了高质量、几何一致的3D世界生成。

Abstract: Explorable 3D world generation from a single image or text prompt forms a
cornerstone of spatial intelligence. Recent works utilize video model to
achieve wide-scope and generalizable 3D world generation. However, existing
approaches often suffer from a limited scope in the generated scenes. In this
work, we propose Matrix-3D, a framework that utilize panoramic representation
for wide-coverage omnidirectional explorable 3D world generation that combines
conditional video generation and panoramic 3D reconstruction. We first train a
trajectory-guided panoramic video diffusion model that employs scene mesh
renders as condition, to enable high-quality and geometrically consistent scene
video generation. To lift the panorama scene video to 3D world, we propose two
separate methods: (1) a feed-forward large panorama reconstruction model for
rapid 3D scene reconstruction and (2) an optimization-based pipeline for
accurate and detailed 3D scene reconstruction. To facilitate effective
training, we also introduce the Matrix-Pano dataset, the first large-scale
synthetic collection comprising 116K high-quality static panoramic video
sequences with depth and trajectory annotations. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance
in panoramic video generation and 3D world generation. See more in

TL;DR: RMT-PPAD是一种基于Transformer的多任务模型，用于实时自动驾驶感知，包括目标检测、可行驶区域分割和车道线分割。通过轻量级模块和自适应解码器优化性能，并在BDD100K数据集上取得领先结果。


<details>

Motivation: 自动驾驶系统需要高精度且实时的全景感知能力，而现有方法在多任务协同和性能优化上存在不足。

Method: 提出RMT-PPAD模型，结合轻量级门控模块和自适应分割解码器，解决任务间负迁移问题，并自动学习多尺度特征权重。

Result: 在BDD100K数据集上，目标检测mAP50为84.9%，召回率95.4%；可行驶区域分割mIoU为92.6%；车道线分割IoU为56.8%，准确率84.7%。推理速度达32.6 FPS。

Conclusion: RMT-PPAD在多任务协同和实时性能上表现优异，适用于实际自动驾驶场景。

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems rely on panoptic driving perception that requires
both precision and real-time performance. In this work, we propose RMT-PPAD, a
real-time, transformer-based multi-task model that jointly performs object
detection, drivable area segmentation, and lane line segmentation. We introduce
a lightweight module, a gate control with an adapter to adaptively fuse shared
and task-specific features, effectively alleviating negative transfer between
tasks. Additionally, we design an adaptive segmentation decoder to learn the
weights over multi-scale features automatically during the training stage. This
avoids the manual design of task-specific structures for different segmentation
tasks. We also identify and resolve the inconsistency between training and
testing labels in lane line segmentation. This allows fairer evaluation.
Experiments on the BDD100K dataset demonstrate that RMT-PPAD achieves
state-of-the-art results with mAP50 of 84.9% and Recall of 95.4% for object
detection, mIoU of 92.6% for drivable area segmentation, and IoU of 56.8% and
accuracy of 84.7% for lane line segmentation. The inference speed reaches 32.6
FPS. Moreover, we introduce real-world scenarios to evaluate RMT-PPAD
performance in practice. The results show that RMT-PPAD consistently delivers
stable performance. The source codes and pre-trained models are released at

*Ming-Kun Xie,Jia-Hao Xiao,Gang Niu,Lei Feng,Zhiqiang Kou,Min-Ling Zhang,Masashi Sugiyama*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出HOPE基准，通过生成误导性干扰项更严格评估大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）的幻觉问题，优于现有POPE基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有POPE基准在评估LVLMs的幻觉问题时效果下降，因其忽略图像特定信息且仅限制于负类别。

Method: HOPE利用CLIP选择高预测似然的负对象作为干扰项，并通过配对真实对象与错误描述生成误导性干扰项。

Result: HOPE使多种LVLMs的精度下降9%至23%，显著优于POPE。

Conclusion: HOPE为评估LVLMs的幻觉问题提供了更严格的基准。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), empowered by the success of Large
Language Models (LLMs), have achieved impressive performance across domains.
Despite the great advances in LVLMs, they still suffer from the unavailable
object hallucination issue, which tends to generate objects inconsistent with
the image content. The most commonly used Polling-based Object Probing
Evaluation (POPE) benchmark evaluates this issue by sampling negative
categories according to category-level statistics, \textit{e.g.}, category
frequencies and co-occurrence. However, with the continuous advancement of
LVLMs, the POPE benchmark has shown diminishing effectiveness in assessing
object hallucination, as it employs a simplistic sampling strategy that
overlooks image-specific information and restricts distractors to negative
object categories only. In this paper, we introduce the Hallucination
searching-based Object Probing Evaluation (HOPE) benchmark, aiming to generate
the most misleading distractors (\textit{i.e.}, non-existent objects or
incorrect image descriptions) that can trigger hallucination in LVLMs, which
serves as a means to more rigorously assess their immunity to hallucination. To
explore the image-specific information, the content-aware hallucination
searching leverages Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) to
approximate the predictive behavior of LVLMs by selecting negative objects with
the highest predicted likelihood as distractors. To expand the scope of
hallucination assessment, the description-based hallucination searching
constructs highly misleading distractors by pairing true objects with false
descriptions. Experimental results show that HOPE leads to a precision drop of
at least 9\% and up to 23\% across various state-of-the-art LVLMs,
significantly outperforming POPE in exposing hallucination vulnerabilities. The
code is available at https://github.com/xiemk/HOPE.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有目标检测数据集（如ImageNet、COCO）主要关注日常物体，缺乏非商业领域的信号稀疏性，MobilTelesco填补了这一空白。

Method: 使用MobilTelesco数据集对多个目标检测模型进行基准测试。

Result: 研究揭示了模型在特征不足条件下的挑战。

Conclusion: MobilTelesco数据集为目标检测在稀疏信号场景下的研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Object detection models are typically trained on datasets like ImageNet,
COCO, and PASCAL VOC, which focus on everyday objects. However, these lack
signal sparsity found in non-commercial domains. MobilTelesco, a
smartphone-based astrophotography dataset, addresses this by providing sparse
night-sky images. We benchmark several detection models on it, highlighting
challenges under feature-deficient conditions.

*Jinghan Yu,Zhiyuan Ma,Yue Ma,Kaiqi Liu,Yuhan Wang,Jianjun Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为MILD的新方法，用于解决复杂多IP场景下的人像擦除问题，通过分层扩散和人体形态引导显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在复杂多IP场景（如人-人遮挡、人-物纠缠和背景干扰）中表现不佳，主要由于数据集限制和缺乏空间解耦能力。

Method: 提出Multi-Layer Diffusion (MILD)策略，将生成过程分解为语义分离的路径，并引入人体形态引导和空间调制注意力机制。

Result: MILD在挑战性的人像擦除基准测试中优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: MILD通过分层生成和人体形态引导有效解决了复杂场景下的人像擦除问题。

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the success of diffusion models in
image-customized tasks. Prior works have achieved notable progress on
human-oriented erasing using explicit mask guidance and semantic-aware
inpainting. However, they struggle under complex multi-IP scenarios involving
human-human occlusions, human-object entanglements, and background
interferences. These challenges are mainly due to: 1) Dataset limitations, as
existing datasets rarely cover dense occlusions, camouflaged backgrounds, and
diverse interactions; 2) Lack of spatial decoupling, where foreground instances
cannot be effectively disentangled, limiting clean background restoration. In
this work, we introduce a high-quality multi-IP human erasing dataset with
diverse pose variations and complex backgrounds. We then propose Multi-Layer
Diffusion (MILD), a novel strategy that decomposes generation into semantically
separated pathways for each instance and the background. To enhance
human-centric understanding, we introduce Human Morphology Guidance,
integrating pose, parsing, and spatial relations. We further present
Spatially-Modulated Attention to better guide attention flow. Extensive
experiments show that MILD outperforms state-of-the-art methods on challenging
human erasing benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种仅使用多视角RGB图像进行3D语义场景图估计的方法，通过语义掩码和邻居节点信息提升特征鲁棒性，实验表明其优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在缺乏3D标注数据的情况下，探索仅利用多视角RGB图像完成3D语义场景图估计任务。

Method: 利用语义掩码指导特征聚合以减少背景噪声，设计新方法结合邻居节点信息，并利用统计先验优化节点和边的预测。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在仅使用多视角图像作为输入时优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 通过语义和空间信息增强节点与边特征，结合邻居关系和统计先验，显著提升了场景图估计的准确性。

Abstract: Modern 3D semantic scene graph estimation methods utilize ground truth 3D
annotations to accurately predict target objects, predicates, and
relationships. In the absence of given 3D ground truth representations, we
explore leveraging only multi-view RGB images to tackle this task. To attain
robust features for accurate scene graph estimation, we must overcome the noisy
reconstructed pseudo point-based geometry from predicted depth maps and reduce
the amount of background noise present in multi-view image features. The key is
to enrich node and edge features with accurate semantic and spatial information
and through neighboring relations. We obtain semantic masks to guide feature
aggregation to filter background features and design a novel method to
incorporate neighboring node information to aid robustness of our scene graph
estimates. Furthermore, we leverage on explicit statistical priors calculated
from the training summary statistics to refine node and edge predictions based
on their one-hop neighborhood. Our experiments show that our method outperforms
current methods purely using multi-view images as the initial input. Our

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NNObfuscator是一种新型实用控制机制，允许AI模型根据预设条件动态调整性能，避免传统多模型方案的资源浪费。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度神经网络训练资源消耗大、多版本模型维护困难的问题，支持单一模型适应多样化需求。

Method: 提出NNObfuscator机制，通过动态调整模型性能实现多级访问控制，实验验证了其在多种任务中的有效性。

Result: 实验表明，NNObfuscator能显著提升模型适应性，单一模型可满足不同性能需求，减少计算资源浪费。

Conclusion: NNObfuscator为AI模型部署提供了高效、可持续的解决方案，支持分层业务模型。

Abstract: Training deep neural networks (DNNs) has become an increasingly
resource-intensive task, requiring large volumes of labeled data, substantial
computational power, and considerable fine-tuning efforts to achieve optimal
performance across diverse use cases. Although pre-trained models offer a
useful starting point, adapting them to meet specific user needs often demands
extensive customization, and infrastructure overhead. This challenge grows when
a single model must support diverse appli-cations with differing requirements
for performance. Traditional solutions often involve training multiple model
versions to meet varying requirements, which can be inefficient and difficult
to maintain. In order to overcome this challenge, we propose NNObfuscator, a
novel utility control mechanism that enables AI models to dynamically modify
their performance according to predefined conditions. It is different from
traditional methods that need separate models for each user. Instead,
NNObfuscator allows a single model to be adapted in real time, giving you
controlled access to multiple levels of performance. This mechanism enables
model owners set up tiered access, ensuring that free-tier users receive a
baseline level of performance while premium users benefit from enhanced
capabilities. The approach improves resource allocation, reduces unnecessary
computation, and supports sustainable business models in AI deployment. To
validate our approach, we conducted experiments on multiple tasks, including
image classification, semantic segmentation, and text to image generation,
using well-established models such as ResNet, DeepLab, VGG16, FCN and Stable
Diffusion. Experimental results show that NNObfuscator successfully makes model
more adaptable, so that a single trained model can handle a broad range of
tasks without requiring a lot of changes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度伪造检测模型存在年龄偏见问题，缺乏多样化的数据集。本文旨在通过构建年龄多样化的数据集来解决这一问题。

Method: 通过整合Celeb-DF、FaceForensics++和UTKFace数据集，并生成合成数据填补年龄分布空白，构建了一个年龄多样化的数据集。使用XceptionNet、EfficientNet和LipForensics三种模型进行评估。

Conclusion: 本文贡献了一个可重复的、公平性强的深度伪造数据集和模型流程，为未来研究提供了基础。

Abstract: The challenges associated with deepfake detection are increasing
significantly with the latest advancements in technology and the growing
popularity of deepfake videos and images. Despite the presence of numerous
detection models, demographic bias in the deepfake dataset remains largely
unaddressed. This paper focuses on the mitigation of age-specific bias in the
deepfake dataset by introducing an age-diverse deepfake dataset that will
improve fairness across age groups. The dataset is constructed through a
modular pipeline incorporating the existing deepfake datasets Celeb-DF,
FaceForensics++, and UTKFace datasets, and the creation of synthetic data to
fill the age distribution gaps. The effectiveness and generalizability of this
dataset are evaluated using three deepfake detection models: XceptionNet,
EfficientNet, and LipForensics. Evaluation metrics, including AUC, pAUC, and
EER, revealed that models trained on the age-diverse dataset demonstrated
fairer performance across age groups, improved overall accuracy, and higher
generalization across datasets. This study contributes a reproducible,
fairness-aware deepfake dataset and model pipeline that can serve as a
foundation for future research in fairer deepfake detection. The complete
dataset and implementation code are available at

spanning individual items, complete outfits, and try-on efficacy.
Counterexamples are aggregated into negative prompts, forming a closed-loop

visual quality, face similarity, and artistic appraisal. Extensive experiments
demonstrate StyleTailor's superior performance in delivering personalized
designs and recommendations, outperforming strong baselines without negative
feedback and establishing a new benchmark for intelligent fashion systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种半自动化的标签错误校正框架REC$\checkmark$D，通过结合现有检测器和众包微任务，系统性修正对象检测数据集中的标签错误。在KITTI数据集上验证，发现原始标注中至少24%的错误率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对象检测数据集中标签错误（如缺失标签、分类错误或定位不准确）严重影响训练和评估效果，但目前缺乏系统性修正方法。

Method: 结合现有错误检测器和众包微任务，通过多标注者独立验证候选边界框，聚合响应以估计模糊性并提升标签质量。

Result: 在KITTI数据集中，发现至少24%的标签错误，并生成高质量修正标注。当前最佳方法仍遗漏66%的真实错误。

Conclusion: REC$\checkmark$D框架有效提升了标签质量，但现有方法仍有改进空间，需进一步研究。发布的基准数据集将推动相关研究。

Abstract: Object detection has advanced rapidly in recent years, driven by increasingly
large and diverse datasets. However, label errors, defined as missing labels,
incorrect classification or inaccurate localization, often compromise the
quality of these datasets. This can have a significant impact on the outcomes
of training and benchmark evaluations. Although several methods now exist for
detecting label errors in object detection datasets, they are typically
validated only on synthetic benchmarks or limited manual inspection. How to
correct such errors systemically and at scale therefore remains an open
problem. We introduce a semi-automated framework for label-error correction
called REC$\checkmark$D (Rechecked). Building on existing detectors, the
framework pairs their error proposals with lightweight, crowd-sourced
microtasks. These tasks enable multiple annotators to independently verify each
candidate bounding box, and their responses are aggregated to estimate
ambiguity and improve label quality. To demonstrate the effectiveness of
REC$\checkmark$D, we apply it to the class pedestrian in the KITTI dataset. Our
crowdsourced review yields high-quality corrected annotations, which indicate a
rate of at least 24% of missing and inaccurate annotations in original
annotations. This validated set will be released as a new real-world benchmark
for label error detection and correction. We show that current label error
detection methods, when combined with our correction framework, can recover
hundreds of errors in the time it would take a human to annotate bounding boxes
from scratch. However, even the best methods still miss up to 66% of the true
errors and with low quality labels introduce more errors than they find. This
highlights the urgent need for further research, now enabled by our released
benchmark.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种多模态特权知识蒸馏（MMPKD）方法，利用训练时额外的模态数据指导单模态视觉模型，提升注意力图的零样本定位能力，但效果不跨域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床实践中部署深度学习模型常需多模态数据，但推理时并非所有模态都可用，需利用训练时额外模态提升模型性能。

Method: 提出MMPKD方法，通过文本和表格元数据教师模型（分别用于胸片和乳腺X光）向视觉Transformer学生模型蒸馏知识。

Result: MMPKD提升了注意力图的零样本定位能力，但效果不跨域。

Conclusion: MMPKD能有效利用训练时额外模态提升单模态模型性能，但跨域泛化能力有限。

Abstract: Deploying deep learning models in clinical practice often requires leveraging
multiple data modalities, such as images, text, and structured data, to achieve
robust and trustworthy decisions. However, not all modalities are always
available at inference time. In this work, we propose multimodal privileged
knowledge distillation (MMPKD), a training strategy that utilizes additional
modalities available solely during training to guide a unimodal vision model.
Specifically, we used a text-based teacher model for chest radiographs
(MIMIC-CXR) and a tabular metadata-based teacher model for mammography
(CBIS-DDSM) to distill knowledge into a vision transformer student model. We
show that MMPKD can improve the resulting attention maps' zero-shot
capabilities of localizing ROI in input images, while this effect does not
generalize across domains, as contrarily suggested by prior research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态情感识别任务由于文本、声学和视觉信号的复杂交互而具有挑战性，现有模型缺乏心理学上有意义的先验来指导多模态对齐。

Method: 提出VEGA机制，利用CLIP的图像编码器构建情感特定的视觉锚点，结合随机锚点采样和自蒸馏的双分支架构。

Result: 在IEMOCAP和MELD数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: VEGA机制通过心理学对齐的表示空间提升了多模态情感识别的性能，代码已开源。

Abstract: Multimodal Emotion Recognition in Conversations remains a challenging task
due to the complex interplay of textual, acoustic and visual signals. While
recent models have improved performance via advanced fusion strategies, they
often lack psychologically meaningful priors to guide multimodal alignment. In
this paper, we revisit the use of CLIP and propose a novel Visual Emotion
Guided Anchoring (VEGA) mechanism that introduces class-level visual semantics
into the fusion and classification process. Distinct from prior work that
primarily utilizes CLIP's textual encoder, our approach leverages its image
encoder to construct emotion-specific visual anchors based on facial exemplars.
These anchors guide unimodal and multimodal features toward a perceptually
grounded and psychologically aligned representation space, drawing inspiration
from cognitive theories (prototypical emotion categories and multisensory
integration). A stochastic anchor sampling strategy further enhances robustness
by balancing semantic stability and intra-class diversity. Integrated into a
dual-branch architecture with self-distillation, our VEGA-augmented model
achieves sota performance on IEMOCAP and MELD. Code is available at:

Abstract: Integrating brain imaging data with clinical reports offers a valuable
opportunity to leverage complementary multimodal information for more effective
and timely diagnosis in practical clinical settings. This approach has gained
significant attention in brain disorder research, yet a key challenge remains:
how to effectively link objective imaging data with subjective text-based
reports, such as doctors' notes. In this work, we propose a novel framework
that aligns brain connectomes with clinical reports in a shared cross-modal
latent space at both the subject and connectome levels, thereby enhancing
representation learning. The key innovation of our approach is that we treat
brain subnetworks as tokens of imaging data, rather than raw image patches, to
align with word tokens in clinical reports. This enables a more efficient
identification of system-level associations between neuroimaging findings and
clinical observations, which is critical since brain disorders often manifest
as network-level abnormalities rather than isolated regional alterations. We
applied our method to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) using the ADNI dataset.
Our approach not only achieves state-of-the-art predictive performance but also
identifies clinically meaningful connectome-text pairs, offering new insights
into the early mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease and supporting the development
of clinically useful multimodal biomarkers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 表面材料识别是机器人感知和物理交互的关键，结合触觉和视觉输入能提升性能。

Method: 提出Surformer v1，结合结构化触觉特征和PCA降维的视觉嵌入，使用模态特定编码器和跨模态注意力层。

Result: Surformer v1在触觉分类中表现最佳，多模态融合下达到99.4%准确率，推理时间仅0.77毫秒。

Conclusion: Surformer v1在准确性、效率和计算成本之间提供了理想平衡，适用于实时应用。

Abstract: Surface material recognition is a key component in robotic perception and
physical interaction, particularly when leveraging both tactile and visual
sensory inputs. In this work, we propose Surformer v1, a transformer-based
architecture designed for surface classification using structured tactile
features and PCA-reduced visual embeddings extracted via ResNet-50. The model
integrates modality-specific encoders with cross-modal attention layers,
enabling rich interactions between vision and touch. Currently,
state-of-the-art deep learning models for vision tasks have achieved remarkable
performance. With this in mind, our first set of experiments focused
exclusively on tactile-only surface classification. Using feature engineering,
we trained and evaluated multiple machine learning models, assessing their
accuracy and inference time. We then implemented an encoder-only Transformer
model tailored for tactile features. This model not only achieved the highest
accuracy but also demonstrated significantly faster inference time compared to
other evaluated models, highlighting its potential for real-time applications.
To extend this investigation, we introduced a multimodal fusion setup by
combining vision and tactile inputs. We trained both Surformer v1 (using
structured features) and Multimodal CNN (using raw images) to examine the
impact of feature-based versus image-based multimodal learning on
classification accuracy and computational efficiency. The results showed that
Surformer v1 achieved 99.4% accuracy with an inference time of 0.77 ms, while
the Multimodal CNN achieved slightly higher accuracy but required significantly
more inference time. These findings suggest Surformer v1 offers a compelling
balance between accuracy, efficiency, and computational cost for surface
material recognition.

Abstract: The existing research has primarily focused on text and image-based hate
speech detection, video-based approaches remain underexplored. In this work, we
introduce a novel dataset, ImpliHateVid, specifically curated for implicit hate
speech detection in videos. ImpliHateVid consists of 2,009 videos comprising
509 implicit hate videos, 500 explicit hate videos, and 1,000 non-hate videos,
making it one of the first large-scale video datasets dedicated to implicit
hate detection. We also propose a novel two-stage contrastive learning
framework for hate speech detection in videos. In the first stage, we train
modality-specific encoders for audio, text, and image using contrastive loss by
concatenating features from the three encoders. In the second stage, we train
cross-encoders using contrastive learning to refine multimodal representations.
Additionally, we incorporate sentiment, emotion, and caption-based features to
enhance implicit hate detection. We evaluate our method on two datasets,
ImpliHateVid for implicit hate speech detection and another dataset for general
hate speech detection in videos, HateMM dataset, demonstrating the
effectiveness of the proposed multimodal contrastive learning for hateful
content detection in videos and the significance of our dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字新闻媒体的普及需要验证内容真实性，尤其是视觉与文本信息的细粒度一致性。传统方法难以解决FCCC问题。

Method: 基于Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs)，结合多阶段上下文推理机制，并通过强化/对抗学习增强模型。

Result: ContextGuard-LVLM在细粒度一致性任务中显著优于InstructBLIP和LLaVA 1.5，且在复杂逻辑推理和上下文理解上表现更优。

Conclusion: 模型在检测复杂上下文分离方面表现出色，并具有更高的鲁棒性和与人类专家判断的一致性。

Abstract: The proliferation of digital news media necessitates robust methods for
verifying content veracity, particularly regarding the consistency between
visual and textual information. Traditional approaches often fall short in
addressing the fine-grained cross-modal contextual consistency (FCCC) problem,
which encompasses deeper alignment of visual narrative, emotional tone, and
background information with text, beyond mere entity matching. To address this,
we propose ContextGuard-LVLM, a novel framework built upon advanced
Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs) and integrating a multi-stage contextual
reasoning mechanism. Our model is uniquely enhanced through reinforced or
adversarial learning paradigms, enabling it to detect subtle contextual
misalignments that evade zero-shot baselines. We extend and augment three
established datasets (TamperedNews-Ent, News400-Ent, MMG-Ent) with new
fine-grained contextual annotations, including "contextual sentiment," "visual
narrative theme," and "scene-event logical coherence," and introduce a
comprehensive CTXT (Contextual Coherence) entity type. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that ContextGuard-LVLM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
zero-shot LVLM baselines (InstructBLIP and LLaVA 1.5) across nearly all
fine-grained consistency tasks, showing significant improvements in complex
logical reasoning and nuanced contextual understanding. Furthermore, our model
exhibits superior robustness to subtle perturbations and a higher agreement
rate with human expert judgments on challenging samples, affirming its efficacy
in discerning sophisticated forms of context detachment.

Method: 采用两阶段框架：多模态概念感知模块（识别并描述视觉特征）和可解释疾病推理模块（结合视觉信息进行诊断并提供透明解释）。

Result: 在Derm7pt数据集上，疾病诊断（83.55% BACC）和概念检测（76.10% BACC）表现优异，超越基线模型。

Conclusion: VL-MedGuide不仅性能优越，还能生成清晰、完整的解释，提升临床实用性。

Abstract: Accurate diagnosis of skin diseases remains a significant challenge due to
the complex and diverse visual features present in dermatoscopic images, often
compounded by a lack of interpretability in existing purely visual diagnostic
models. To address these limitations, this study introduces VL-MedGuide
(Visual-Linguistic Medical Guide), a novel framework leveraging the powerful
multi-modal understanding and reasoning capabilities of Visual-Language Large
Models (LVLMs) for intelligent and inherently interpretable auxiliary diagnosis
of skin conditions. VL-MedGuide operates in two interconnected stages: a
Multi-modal Concept Perception Module, which identifies and linguistically
describes dermatologically relevant visual features through sophisticated
prompt engineering, and an Explainable Disease Reasoning Module, which
integrates these concepts with raw visual information via Chain-of-Thought
prompting to provide precise disease diagnoses alongside transparent
rationales. Comprehensive experiments on the Derm7pt dataset demonstrate that
VL-MedGuide achieves state-of-the-art performance in both disease diagnosis
(83.55% BACC, 80.12% F1) and concept detection (76.10% BACC, 67.45% F1),
surpassing existing baselines. Furthermore, human evaluations confirm the high
clarity, completeness, and trustworthiness of its generated explanations,
bridging the gap between AI performance and clinical utility by offering
actionable, explainable insights for dermatological practice.

diffusion models to learn the image translation process, allowing for more
coverable modeling of the data distribution and performance improvement of the
cross-domain translation. However, incorporating the translation process within
the diffusion process is still challenging since the two processes are not
aligned exactly, i.e., the diffusion process is applied to the noisy signal
while the translation process is conducted on the clean signal. As a result,
recent diffusion-based studies employ separate training or shallow integration
to learn the two processes, yet this may cause the local minimal of the
translation optimization, constraining the effectiveness of diffusion models.
To address the problem, we propose a novel joint learning framework that aligns
the diffusion and the translation process, thereby improving the global
optimality. Specifically, we propose to extract the image components with
diffusion models to represent the clean signal and employ the translation
process with the image components, enabling an end-to-end joint learning
manner. On the other hand, we introduce a time-dependent translation network to
learn the complex translation mapping, resulting in effective translation
learning and significant performance improvement. Benefiting from the design of
joint learning, our method enables global optimization of both processes,
enhancing the optimality and achieving improved fidelity and structural
consistency. We have conducted extensive experiments on RGB$\leftrightarrow$RGB
and diverse cross-modality translation tasks including
RGB$\leftrightarrow$Edge, RGB$\leftrightarrow$Semantics and
RGB$\leftrightarrow$Depth, showcasing better generative performances than the
state of the arts.

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have shown impressive performance in novel view
synthesis, but challenges remain in rendering scenes with complex specular
reflections and highlights. Existing approaches may produce blurry reflections
due to entanglement between lighting and material properties, or encounter
optimization instability when relying on physically-based inverse rendering. In
this work, we present a neural rendering framework based on dynamic coefficient
decomposition, aiming to improve the modeling of view-dependent appearance. Our
approach decomposes complex appearance into a shared, static neural basis that
encodes intrinsic material properties, and a set of dynamic coefficients
generated by a Coefficient Network conditioned on view and illumination. A
Dynamic Radiance Integrator then combines these components to synthesize the
final radiance. Experimental results on several challenging benchmarks suggest
that our method can produce sharper and more realistic specular highlights
compared to existing techniques. We hope that this decomposition paradigm can
provide a flexible and effective direction for modeling complex appearance in
neural scene representations.

Abstract: Micro-expression recognition (MER) is a highly challenging task in affective
computing. With the reduced-sized micro-expression (ME) input that contains key
information based on key-frame indexes, key-frame-based methods have
significantly improved the performance of MER. However, most of these methods
focus on improving the performance with relatively accurate key-frame indexes,
while ignoring the difficulty of obtaining accurate key-frame indexes and the
objective existence of key-frame index errors, which impedes them from moving
towards practical applications. In this paper, we propose CausalNet, a novel
framework to achieve robust MER facing key-frame index errors while maintaining
accurate recognition. To enhance robustness, CausalNet takes the representation
of the entire ME sequence as the input. To address the information redundancy
brought by the complete ME range input and maintain accurate recognition,
first, the Causal Motion Position Learning Module (CMPLM) is proposed to help
the model locate the muscle movement areas related to Action Units (AUs),
thereby reducing the attention to other redundant areas. Second, the Causal
Attention Block (CAB) is proposed to deeply learn the causal relationships
between the muscle contraction and relaxation movements in MEs. Empirical
experiments have demonstrated that on popular ME benchmarks, the CausalNet has
achieved robust MER under different levels of key-frame index noise. Meanwhile,
it has surpassed state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on several standard MER
benchmarks when using the provided annotated key-frames. Code is available at

Conclusion: 聚类级水印方法在抗干扰性和检测能力上表现优异，且验证速度快，适用于自回归图像模型。

Abstract: In-generation watermarking for detecting and attributing generated content
has recently been explored for latent diffusion models (LDMs), demonstrating
high robustness. However, the use of in-generation watermarks in autoregressive
(AR) image models has not been explored yet. AR models generate images by
autoregressively predicting a sequence of visual tokens that are then decoded
into pixels using a vector-quantized decoder. Inspired by red-green watermarks
for large language models, we examine token-level watermarking schemes that
bias the next-token prediction based on prior tokens. We find that a direct
transfer of these schemes works in principle, but the detectability of the
watermarks decreases considerably under common image perturbations. As a
remedy, we propose two novel watermarking methods that rely on visual token
clustering to assign similar tokens to the same set. Firstly, we investigate a
training-free approach that relies on a cluster lookup table, and secondly, we
finetune VAE encoders to predict token clusters directly from perturbed images.
Overall, our experiments show that cluster-level watermarks improve robustness
against perturbations and regeneration attacks while preserving image quality.
Cluster classification further boosts watermark detectability, outperforming a
set of baselines. Moreover, our methods offer fast verification runtime,
comparable to lightweight post-hoc watermarking methods.

Conclusion: 结构优先的视觉学习能提升效率、泛化能力和人类对齐的归纳偏置，为构建更鲁棒的视觉系统提供策略。

Abstract: Despite remarkable progress in computer vision, modern recognition systems
remain limited by their dependence on rich, redundant visual inputs. In
contrast, humans can effortlessly understand sparse, minimal representations
like line drawings - suggesting that structure, rather than appearance,
underlies efficient visual understanding. In this work, we propose using line
drawings as a structure-first pretraining modality to induce more compact and
generalizable visual representations. We show that models pretrained on line
drawings develop stronger shape bias, more focused attention, and greater data
efficiency across classification, detection, and segmentation tasks. Notably,
these models also exhibit lower intrinsic dimensionality, requiring
significantly fewer principal components to capture representational variance -
echoing the similar observation in low dimensional efficient representation in
the brain. Beyond performance improvements, line drawing pretraining produces
more compressible representations, enabling better distillation into
lightweight student models. Students distilled from line-pretrained teachers
consistently outperform those trained from color-supervised teachers,
highlighting the benefits of structurally compact knowledge. Finally, we
demonstrate that the pretraining with line-drawing can also be extended to
unsupervised setting via our proposed method "learning to draw". Together, our
results support the view that structure-first visual learning fosters
efficiency, generalization, and human-aligned inductive biases - offering a
simple yet powerful strategy for building more robust and adaptable vision
systems.

Conclusion: MMFformer在多模态抑郁症检测中优于现有方法，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Depression is a serious mental health illness that significantly affects an
individual's well-being and quality of life, making early detection crucial for
adequate care and treatment. Detecting depression is often difficult, as it is
based primarily on subjective evaluations during clinical interviews. Hence,
the early diagnosis of depression, thanks to the content of social networks,
has become a prominent research area. The extensive and diverse nature of
user-generated information poses a significant challenge, limiting the accurate
extraction of relevant temporal information and the effective fusion of data
across multiple modalities. This paper introduces MMFformer, a multimodal
depression detection network designed to retrieve depressive spatio-temporal
high-level patterns from multimodal social media information. The transformer
network with residual connections captures spatial features from videos, and a
transformer encoder is exploited to design important temporal dynamics in
audio. Moreover, the fusion architecture fused the extracted features through
late and intermediate fusion strategies to find out the most relevant
intermodal correlations among them. Finally, the proposed network is assessed
on two large-scale depression detection datasets, and the results clearly
reveal that it surpasses existing state-of-the-art approaches, improving the
F1-Score by 13.92% for D-Vlog dataset and 7.74% for LMVD dataset. The code is

user-defined waveforms with digital holograms. An efficient and fast pipeline
framework is proposed to synthesize CGH using initial point cloud and MRI data.
This input data is reconstructed into volumetric objects that are then input
into non-convex Fourier optics optimization algorithms for phase-only hologram
(POH) and complex-hologram (CH) generation using alternating projection, SGD,
and quasi-Netwton methods. Comparison of reconstruction performance of these
algorithms as measured by MSE, RMSE, and PSNR is analyzed as well as to HoloNet
deep learning CGH. Performance metrics are shown to be improved by using 2D
median filtering to remove artifacts and speckled noise during optimization.

Abstract: Creating deformable 3D content has gained increasing attention with the rise
of text-to-image and image-to-video generative models. While these models
provide rich semantic priors for appearance, they struggle to capture the
physical realism and motion dynamics needed for authentic 4D scene synthesis.
In contrast, real-world videos can provide physically grounded geometry and
articulation cues that are difficult to hallucinate. One question is raised:
\textit{Can we generate physically consistent 4D content by leveraging the
motion priors of the real-world video}? In this work, we explore the task of
reanimating deformable 3D scenes from a single video, using the original
sequence as a supervisory signal to correct artifacts from synthetic motion. We
introduce \textbf{Restage4D}, a geometry-preserving pipeline for
video-conditioned 4D restaging. Our approach uses a video-rewinding training
strategy to temporally bridge a real base video and a synthetic driving video
via a shared motion representation. We further incorporate an occlusion-aware
rigidity loss and a disocclusion backtracing mechanism to improve structural
and geometry consistency under challenging motion. We validate Restage4D on
DAVIS and PointOdyssey, demonstrating improved geometry consistency, motion
quality, and 3D tracking performance. Our method not only preserves deformable
structure under novel motion, but also automatically corrects errors introduced
by generative models, revealing the potential of video prior in 4D restaging
task. Source code and trained models will be released.

Abstract: Accurate, noninvasive detection of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation is
essential for effective glioma management. Traditional methods rely on invasive
tissue sampling, which may fail to capture a tumor's spatial heterogeneity.
While deep learning models have shown promise in molecular profiling, their
performance is often limited by scarce annotated data. In contrast, foundation
deep learning models offer a more generalizable approach for glioma imaging
biomarkers. We propose a Foundation-based Biomarker Network (FoundBioNet) that
utilizes a SWIN-UNETR-based architecture to noninvasively predict IDH mutation
status from multi-parametric MRI. Two key modules are incorporated: Tumor-Aware
Feature Encoding (TAFE) for extracting multi-scale, tumor-focused features, and
Cross-Modality Differential (CMD) for highlighting subtle T2-FLAIR mismatch
signals associated with IDH mutation. The model was trained and validated on a
diverse, multi-center cohort of 1705 glioma patients from six public datasets.
Our model achieved AUCs of 90.58%, 88.08%, 65.41%, and 80.31% on independent
test sets from EGD, TCGA, Ivy GAP, RHUH, and UPenn, consistently outperforming
baseline approaches (p <= 0.05). Ablation studies confirmed that both the TAFE
and CMD modules are essential for improving predictive accuracy. By integrating
large-scale pretraining and task-specific fine-tuning, FoundBioNet enables
generalizable glioma characterization. This approach enhances diagnostic
accuracy and interpretability, with the potential to enable more personalized
patient care.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress
across a range of vision-language tasks and demonstrate strong potential for
traffic accident understanding. However, existing MLLMs in this domain
primarily focus on coarse-grained image-level or video-level comprehension and
often struggle to handle fine-grained visual details or localized scene
components, limiting their applicability in complex accident scenarios. To
address these limitations, we propose SafePLUG, a novel framework that empowers
MLLMs with both Pixel-Level Understanding and temporal Grounding for
comprehensive traffic accident analysis. SafePLUG supports both
arbitrary-shaped visual prompts for region-aware question answering and
pixel-level segmentation based on language instructions, while also enabling
the recognition of temporally anchored events in traffic accident scenarios. To
advance the development of MLLMs for traffic accident understanding, we curate
a new dataset containing multimodal question-answer pairs centered on diverse
accident scenarios, with detailed pixel-level annotations and temporal event
boundaries. Experimental results show that SafePLUG achieves strong performance
on multiple tasks, including region-based question answering, pixel-level
segmentation, temporal event localization, and accident event understanding.
These capabilities lay a foundation for fine-grained understanding of complex
traffic scenes, with the potential to improve driving safety and enhance
situational awareness in smart transportation systems. The code, dataset, and
model checkpoints will be made publicly available at:

Abstract: Accurate localization of organ boundaries is critical in medical imaging for
segmentation, registration, surgical planning, and radiotherapy. While deep
convolutional networks (ConvNets) have advanced general-purpose edge detection
to near-human performance on natural images, their outputs often lack precise
localization, a limitation that is particularly harmful in medical applications
where millimeter-level accuracy is required. Building on a systematic analysis
of ConvNet edge outputs, we propose a medically focused crisp edge detector
that adapts a novel top-down backward refinement architecture to medical images
(2D and volumetric). Our method progressively upsamples and fuses high-level
semantic features with fine-grained low-level cues through a backward
refinement pathway, producing high-resolution, well-localized organ boundaries.
We further extend the design to handle anisotropic volumes by combining 2D
slice-wise refinement with light 3D context aggregation to retain computational
efficiency. Evaluations on several CT and MRI organ datasets demonstrate
substantially improved boundary localization under strict criteria (boundary
F-measure, Hausdorff distance) compared to baseline ConvNet detectors and
contemporary medical edge/contour methods. Importantly, integrating our crisp
edge maps into downstream pipelines yields consistent gains in organ
segmentation (higher Dice scores, lower boundary errors), more accurate image
registration, and improved delineation of lesions near organ interfaces. The
proposed approach produces clinically valuable, crisp organ edges that
materially enhance common medical-imaging tasks.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of melanocytic tumors in dermoscopic images is a
critical step for automated skin cancer screening and clinical decision
support. Unlike natural scene segmentation, lesion delineation must reconcile
subtle texture and color variations, frequent artifacts (hairs, rulers,
bubbles), and a strong need for precise boundary localization to support
downstream diagnosis. In this paper we introduce Our method, a novel ResNet
inspired dual resolution architecture specifically designed for melanocytic
tumor segmentation. Our method maintains a full resolution stream that
preserves fine grained boundary information while a complementary pooled stream
aggregates multi scale contextual cues for robust lesion recognition. The
streams are tightly coupled by boundary aware residual connections that inject
high frequency edge information into deep feature maps, and by a channel
attention module that adapts color and texture sensitivity to dermoscopic
appearance. To further address common imaging artifacts and the limited size of
clinical datasets, we propose a lightweight artifact suppression block and a
multi task training objective that combines a Dice Tversky segmentation loss
with an explicit boundary loss and a contrastive regularizer for feature
stability. The combined design yields pixel accurate masks without requiring
heavy post processing or complex pre training protocols. Extensive experiments
on public dermoscopic benchmarks demonstrate that Our method significantly
improves boundary adherence and clinically relevant segmentation metrics
compared to standard encoder decoder baselines, making it a practical building
block for automated melanoma assessment systems.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of subcutaneous vessels from clinical images is
hampered by scarce, expensive ground truth and by low contrast, noisy
appearance of vessels across patients and modalities. We present a novel weakly
supervised training framework tailored for subcutaneous vessel segmentation
that leverages inexpensive sparse annotations (e.g., centerline traces, dot
markers, or short scribbles). Sparse labels are expanded into dense,
probabilistic supervision via a differentiable random walk label propagation
model whose transition weights incorporate image driven vesselness cues and
tubular continuity priors. The propagation yields per-pixel hitting
probabilities together with calibrated uncertainty estimates; these are
incorporated into an uncertainty weighted loss to avoid over fitting to
ambiguous regions. Crucially, the label-propagator is learned jointly with a
CNN based segmentation predictor, enabling the system to discover vessel edges
and continuity constraints without explicit edge supervision. We further
introduce a topology aware regularizer that encourages centerline connectivity
and penalizes spurious branches, improving clinical usability. In experiments
on clinical subcutaneous imaging datasets, our method consistently outperforms
naive training on sparse labels and conventional dense pseudo-labeling,
producing more complete vascular maps and better calibrated uncertainty for
downstream decision making. The approach substantially reduces annotation
burden while preserving clinically relevant vessel topology.

Abstract: Adapting person re-identification (reID) models to new target environments
remains a challenging problem that is typically addressed using unsupervised
domain adaptation (UDA) methods. Recent works show that when labeled data
originates from several distinct sources (e.g., datasets and cameras),
considering each source separately and applying multi-source domain adaptation
(MSDA) typically yields higher accuracy and robustness compared to blending the
sources and performing conventional UDA. However, state-of-the-art MSDA methods
learn domain-specific backbone models or require access to source domain data
during adaptation, resulting in significant growth in training parameters and
computational cost. In this paper, a Source-free Adaptive Gated Experts
(SAGE-reID) method is introduced for person reID. Our SAGE-reID is a
cost-effective, source-free MSDA method that first trains individual
source-specific low-rank adapters (LoRA) through source-free UDA. Next, a
lightweight gating network is introduced and trained to dynamically assign
optimal merging weights for fusion of LoRA experts, enabling effective
cross-domain knowledge transfer. While the number of backbone parameters
remains constant across source domains, LoRA experts scale linearly but remain
negligible in size (<= 2% of the backbone), reducing both the memory
consumption and risk of overfitting. Extensive experiments conducted on three
challenging benchmarks: Market-1501, DukeMTMC-reID, and MSMT17 indicate that
SAGE-reID outperforms state-of-the-art methods while being computationally
efficient.

Abstract: This study addresses the challenge of accurately forecasting geometric
deviations in manufactured components using advanced 3D surface analysis.
Despite progress in modern manufacturing, maintaining dimensional precision
remains difficult, particularly for complex geometries. We present a
methodology that employs a high-resolution 3D scanner to acquire multi-angle
surface data from 237 components produced across different batches. The data
were processed through precise alignment, noise reduction, and merging
techniques to generate accurate 3D representations. A hybrid machine learning
framework was developed, combining convolutional neural networks for feature
extraction with gradient-boosted decision trees for predictive modeling. The
proposed system achieved a prediction accuracy of 0.012 mm at a 95% confidence
level, representing a 73% improvement over conventional statistical process
control methods. In addition to improved accuracy, the model revealed hidden
correlations between manufacturing parameters and geometric deviations. This
approach offers significant potential for automated quality control, predictive
maintenance, and design optimization in precision manufacturing, and the
resulting dataset provides a strong foundation for future predictive modeling
research.

performance across multiple evaluation metrics, offering a scalable and
interpretable solution for image captioning.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的联合稀疏自表示学习模型，用于多视图聚类，通过引入基数约束提取局部信息，并开发了全局收敛的交替二次惩罚方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多视图聚类中，子空间聚类是关键技术，但现有方法在提取局部信息和保证收敛性方面存在不足。

Method: 使用基数约束替代图拉普拉斯正则化，提取视图特定局部信息；低秩约束用于揭示全局一致结构；开发了交替二次惩罚方法保证收敛。

Result: 在六个标准数据集上优于八种现有算法。

Conclusion: 提出的模型和方法在多视图聚类中表现出优越性能，解决了收敛性和局部信息提取问题。

Abstract: Multiview clustering (MC) aims to group samples using consistent and
complementary information across various views. The subspace clustering, as a
fundamental technique of MC, has attracted significant attention. In this
paper, we propose a novel joint sparse self-representation learning model for
MC, where a featured difference is the extraction of view-specific local
information by introducing cardinality (i.e., $\ell_0$-norm) constraints
instead of Graph-Laplacian regularization. Specifically, under each view,
cardinality constraints directly restrict the samples used in the
self-representation stage to extract reliable local and global structure
information, while the low-rank constraint aids in revealing a global coherent
structure in the consensus affinity matrix during merging. The attendant
challenge is that Augmented Lagrange Method (ALM)-based alternating
minimization algorithms cannot guarantee convergence when applied directly to
our nonconvex, nonsmooth model, thus resulting in poor generalization ability.
To address it, we develop an alternating quadratic penalty (AQP) method with
global convergence, where two subproblems are iteratively solved by closed-form
solutions. Empirical results on six standard datasets demonstrate the
superiority of our model and AQP method, compared to eight state-of-the-art
algorithms.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为VSI的多模态关键帧搜索方法，通过整合字幕和时间戳等信息，显著提升了长视频理解任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长视频理解任务因数据规模庞大而具有挑战性，传统关键帧检索方法因多模态对齐不足和无法捕捉复杂时间语义信息而效果有限。

Method: 提出VSI方法，通过双流搜索机制（视频搜索流和字幕匹配流）整合视觉和文本信息，提升关键帧搜索精度。

Result: 在LongVideoBench上，VSI的关键帧定位准确率达40.00%，视频问答任务准确率达68.48%，显著超越基线方法。

Conclusion: VSI在长视频理解任务中表现出色，验证了多模态搜索策略的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Long video understanding presents a significant challenge to multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) primarily due to the immense data scale. A critical and
widely adopted strategy for making this task computationally tractable is
keyframe retrieval, which seeks to identify a sparse set of video frames that
are most salient to a given textual query. However, the efficacy of this
approach is hindered by weak multimodal alignment between textual queries and
visual content and fails to capture the complex temporal semantic information
required for precise reasoning. To address this, we propose Visual-Subtitle
Integeration(VSI), a multimodal keyframe search method that integrates
subtitles, timestamps, and scene boundaries into a unified multimodal search
process. The proposed method captures the visual information of video frames as
well as the complementary textual information through a dual-stream search
mechanism by Video Search Stream as well as Subtitle Match Stream,
respectively, and improves the keyframe search accuracy through the interaction
of the two search streams. Experimental results show that VSI achieve 40.00%
key frame localization accuracy on the text-relevant subset of LongVideoBench
and 68.48% accuracy on downstream long Video-QA tasks, surpassing competitive
baselines by 20.35% and 15.79%, respectively. Furthermore, on the
LongVideoBench, VSI achieved state-of-the-art(SOTA) in medium-to-long video-QA
tasks, demonstrating the robustness and generalizability of the proposed
multimodal search strategy.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新型噪声抑制特征金字塔网络（NS-FPN），通过低频引导特征净化（LFP）模块和螺旋感知特征采样（SFS）模块，显著降低了红外小目标检测与分割（IRSTDS）任务中的误报率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 红外小目标检测与分割任务因目标暗淡、形状模糊及背景干扰严重而极具挑战性。现有CNN方法虽提升了特征表示，但未能有效抑制噪声，导致误报率增加。

Method: 提出NS-FPN，结合LFP模块（通过净化高频成分抑制噪声）和SFS模块（螺旋采样融合目标相关特征），轻量且易于集成到现有框架。

Result: 在公开数据集上，NS-FPN显著降低误报率，性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 从频域噪声抑制角度改进IRSTDS任务，NS-FPN为轻量高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Infrared small target detection and segmentation (IRSTDS) is a critical yet
challenging task in defense and civilian applications, owing to the dim,
shapeless appearance of targets and severe background clutter. Recent CNN-based
methods have achieved promising target perception results, but they only focus
on enhancing feature representation to offset the impact of noise, which
results in the increased false alarms problem. In this paper, through analyzing
the problem from the frequency domain, we pioneer in improving performance from
noise suppression perspective and propose a novel noise-suppression feature
pyramid network (NS-FPN), which integrates a low-frequency guided feature
purification (LFP) module and a spiral-aware feature sampling (SFS) module into
the original FPN structure. The LFP module suppresses the noise features by
purifying high-frequency components to achieve feature enhancement devoid of
noise interference, while the SFS module further adopts spiral sampling to fuse
target-relevant features in feature fusion process. Our NS-FPN is designed to
be lightweight yet effective and can be easily plugged into existing IRSTDS
frameworks. Extensive experiments on the public IRSTDS datasets demonstrate
that our method significantly reduces false alarms and achieves superior
performance on IRSTDS tasks.

TL;DR: 论文提出BASIC方法，通过直接视觉监督优化视觉嵌入，提升多模态大语言模型的视觉理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅将视觉嵌入作为上下文线索，缺乏直接视觉监督，限制了视觉嵌入的精细对齐。

Method: BASIC利用LLM浅层中精炼的视觉嵌入作为监督，从嵌入方向和语义匹配两方面优化初始视觉嵌入。

Result: BASIC显著提升了MLLMs在多个基准测试中的性能，无需额外监督模型或人工标注。

Conclusion: 直接视觉监督能有效提升视觉嵌入的质量，进而增强多模态模型的视觉理解能力。

Abstract: Mainstream Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) achieve visual
understanding by using a vision projector to bridge well-pretrained vision
encoders and large language models (LLMs). The inherent gap between visual and
textual modalities makes the embeddings from the vision projector critical for
visual comprehension. However, current alignment approaches treat visual
embeddings as contextual cues and merely apply auto-regressive supervision to
textual outputs, neglecting the necessity of introducing equivalent direct
visual supervision, which hinders the potential finer alignment of visual
embeddings. In this paper, based on our analysis of the refinement process of
visual embeddings in the LLM's shallow layers, we propose BASIC, a method that
utilizes refined visual embeddings within the LLM as supervision to directly
guide the projector in generating initial visual embeddings. Specifically, the
guidance is conducted from two perspectives: (i) optimizing embedding
directions by reducing angles between initial and supervisory embeddings in
semantic space; (ii) improving semantic matching by minimizing disparities
between the logit distributions of both visual embeddings. Without additional
supervisory models or artificial annotations, BASIC significantly improves the
performance of MLLMs across a wide range of benchmarks, demonstrating the
effectiveness of our introduced direct visual supervision.

Abstract: Chinese font generation aims to create a new Chinese font library based on
some reference samples. It is a topic of great concern to many font designers
and typographers. Over the past years, with the rapid development of deep
learning algorithms, various new techniques have achieved flourishing and
thriving progress. Nevertheless, how to improve the overall quality of

background of the task. Then, we outline our literature selection and analysis
methodology, and review a series of related fundamentals, including classical
deep learning architectures, font representation formats, public datasets, and
frequently-used evaluation metrics. After that, relying on the number of
reference samples required to generate a new font, we categorize the existing
methods into two major groups: many-shot font generation and few-shot font
generation methods. Within each category, representative approaches are
summarized, and their strengths and limitations are also discussed in detail.
Finally, we conclude our paper with the challenges and future directions, with
the expectation to provide some valuable illuminations for the researchers in
this field.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个名为eMotions的大规模短视频情感分析数据集，并开发了AV-CANet网络来解决音频-视觉融合中的情感表达不一致问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 短视频（SVs）的多模态复杂性为情感分析带来了新挑战，现有数据集不足且情感表达不一致。

Method: 提出AV-CANet网络，结合视频Transformer和局部-全局融合模块，并设计EP-CE损失函数优化模型。

Result: 在多个数据集上验证了AV-CANet的有效性，并通过消融实验分析了关键组件。

Conclusion: AV-CANet为短视频情感分析提供了有效解决方案，数据集和代码将开源。

Abstract: Short-form videos (SVs) have become a vital part of our online routine for
acquiring and sharing information. Their multimodal complexity poses new
challenges for video analysis, highlighting the need for video emotion analysis
(VEA) within the community. Given the limited availability of SVs emotion data,
we introduce eMotions, a large-scale dataset consisting of 27,996 videos with
full-scale annotations. To ensure quality and reduce subjective bias, we
emphasize better personnel allocation and propose a multi-stage annotation
procedure. Additionally, we provide the category-balanced and test-oriented
variants through targeted sampling to meet diverse needs. While there have been
significant studies on videos with clear emotional cues (e.g., facial
expressions), analyzing emotions in SVs remains a challenging task. The
challenge arises from the broader content diversity, which introduces more
distinct semantic gaps and complicates the representations learning of
emotion-related features. Furthermore, the prevalence of audio-visual
co-expressions in SVs leads to the local biases and collective information gaps
caused by the inconsistencies in emotional expressions. To tackle this, we
propose AV-CANet, an end-to-end audio-visual fusion network that leverages
video transformer to capture semantically relevant representations. We further
introduce the Local-Global Fusion Module designed to progressively capture the
correlations of audio-visual features. Besides, EP-CE Loss is constructed to
globally steer optimizations with tripolar penalties. Extensive experiments
across three eMotions-related datasets and four public VEA datasets demonstrate
the effectiveness of our proposed AV-CANet, while providing broad insights for
future research. Moreover, we conduct ablation studies to examine the critical
components of our method. Dataset and code will be made available at Github.

### [51] [A Simple yet Powerful Instance-Aware Prompting Framework for Training-free Camouflaged Object Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06904)
*Chao Yin,Jide Li,Xiaoqiang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的实例感知提示框架（IAPF），通过多模态大语言模型和区域约束点提示生成精细实例掩码，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于训练的伪装物体分割（COS）方法在标注稀疏时性能下降，而训练免费方法通常只能生成粗粒度语义掩码，无法处理多实例场景。

Method: IAPF框架包括文本提示生成器、实例掩码生成器和自一致性投票，利用MLLM和Grounding DINO生成实例级掩码。

Result: 在标准COS基准测试中，IAPF显著优于现有训练免费方法。

Conclusion: IAPF为训练免费COS提供了高效解决方案，解决了多实例场景的挑战。

Abstract: Camouflaged Object Segmentation (COS) remains highly challenging due to the
intrinsic visual similarity between target objects and their surroundings.
While training-based COS methods achieve good performance, their performance
degrades rapidly with increased annotation sparsity. To circumvent this
limitation, recent studies have explored training-free COS methods, leveraging
the Segment Anything Model (SAM) by automatically generating visual prompts
from a single task-generic prompt (\textit{e.g.}, "\textit{camouflaged
animal}") uniformly applied across all test images. However, these methods
typically produce only semantic-level visual prompts, causing SAM to output
coarse semantic masks and thus failing to handle scenarios with multiple
discrete camouflaged instances effectively. To address this critical
limitation, we propose a simple yet powerful \textbf{I}nstance-\textbf{A}ware
\textbf{P}rompting \textbf{F}ramework (IAPF), the first training-free COS
pipeline that explicitly converts a task-generic prompt into fine-grained
instance masks. Specifically, the IAPF comprises three steps: (1) Text Prompt
Generator, utilizing task-generic queries to prompt a Multimodal Large Language
Model (MLLM) for generating image-specific foreground and background tags; (2)
\textbf{Instance Mask Generator}, leveraging Grounding DINO to produce precise
instance-level bounding box prompts, alongside the proposed Single-Foreground
Multi-Background Prompting strategy to sample region-constrained point prompts
within each box, enabling SAM to yield a candidate instance mask; (3)
Self-consistency Instance Mask Voting, which selects the final COS prediction
by identifying the candidate mask most consistent across multiple candidate
instance masks. Extensive evaluations on standard COS benchmarks demonstrate
that the proposed IAPF significantly surpasses existing state-of-the-art
training-free COS methods.

TL;DR: 论文提出MultiRef-bench评估框架，用于多视觉参考的图像生成任务，发现现有模型在多参考条件下表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉设计通常需要结合多个视觉参考，但现有图像生成框架主要依赖单源输入，缺乏多参考整合能力。

Method: 构建MultiRef-bench评估框架和RefBlend数据引擎，生成合成和真实样本，并测试多种模型。

Result: 最佳模型OmniGen在合成和真实样本上的表现分别为66.6%和79.0%，显示多参考任务的挑战性。

Conclusion: 研究为开发更灵活、类人的创意工具提供了方向，数据集已公开。

Abstract: Visual designers naturally draw inspiration from multiple visual references,
combining diverse elements and aesthetic principles to create artwork. However,
current image generative frameworks predominantly rely on single-source inputs
-- either text prompts or individual reference images. In this paper, we focus
on the task of controllable image generation using multiple visual references.
We introduce MultiRef-bench, a rigorous evaluation framework comprising 990
synthetic and 1,000 real-world samples that require incorporating visual
content from multiple reference images. The synthetic samples are synthetically
generated through our data engine RefBlend, with 10 reference types and 33
reference combinations. Based on RefBlend, we further construct a dataset
MultiRef containing 38k high-quality images to facilitate further research. Our
experiments across three interleaved image-text models (i.e., OmniGen, ACE, and
Show-o) and six agentic frameworks (e.g., ChatDiT and LLM + SD) reveal that
even state-of-the-art systems struggle with multi-reference conditioning, with
the best model OmniGen achieving only 66.6% in synthetic samples and 79.0% in
real-world cases on average compared to the golden answer. These findings
provide valuable directions for developing more flexible and human-like
creative tools that can effectively integrate multiple sources of visual
inspiration. The dataset is publicly available at: https://multiref.github.io/.

Method: 构建包含20,710多模态查询和库图像的MMReID-Bench，涵盖10种任务，测试MLLMs能力。

Result: MLLMs在多模态行人重识别中表现优异，但在处理热成像和红外数据时存在局限。

Conclusion: MMReID-Bench有望推动更鲁棒的多模态基础模型发展。

Abstract: Person re-identification (ReID) aims to retrieve the images of an interested
person in the gallery images, with wide applications in medical rehabilitation,
abnormal behavior detection, and public security. However, traditional person
ReID models suffer from uni-modal capability, leading to poor generalization
ability in multi-modal data, such as RGB, thermal, infrared, sketch images,
textual descriptions, etc. Recently, the emergence of multi-modal large
language models (MLLMs) shows a promising avenue for addressing this problem.
Despite this potential, existing methods merely regard MLLMs as feature
extractors or caption generators, which do not fully unleash their reasoning,
instruction-following, and cross-modal understanding capabilities. To bridge
this gap, we introduce MMReID-Bench, the first multi-task multi-modal benchmark
specifically designed for person ReID. The MMReID-Bench includes 20,710
multi-modal queries and gallery images covering 10 different person ReID tasks.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the remarkable capabilities of MLLMs in
delivering effective and versatile person ReID. Nevertheless, they also have
limitations in handling a few modalities, particularly thermal and infrared
data. We hope MMReID-Bench can facilitate the community to develop more robust
and generalizable multimodal foundation models for person ReID.

Conclusion: Talk2Image通过多代理协作和反馈机制，实现了用户意图的逐步对齐和一致的图像编辑。

Abstract: Text-to-image generation tasks have driven remarkable advances in diverse
media applications, yet most focus on single-turn scenarios and struggle with
iterative, multi-turn creative tasks. Recent dialogue-based systems attempt to
bridge this gap, but their single-agent, sequential paradigm often causes
intention drift and incoherent edits. To address these limitations, we present
Talk2Image, a novel multi-agent system for interactive image generation and
editing in multi-turn dialogue scenarios. Our approach integrates three key
components: intention parsing from dialogue history, task decomposition and
collaborative execution across specialized agents, and feedback-driven
refinement based on a multi-view evaluation mechanism. Talk2Image enables
step-by-step alignment with user intention and consistent image editing.
Experiments demonstrate that Talk2Image outperforms existing baselines in
controllability, coherence, and user satisfaction across iterative image
generation and editing tasks.

Abstract: Inspired by the success of reinforcement learning (RL) in refining large

training into autoregressive (AR) image generation models. We adapt the Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm to refine the vanilla
autoregressive models' outputs by carefully designed reward functions that
evaluate generated images across multiple quality dimensions, including
perceptual quality, realism, and semantic fidelity. We conduct comprehensive
experiments on both class-conditional (i.e., class-to-image) and
text-conditional (i.e., text-to-image) image generation tasks, demonstrating
that our RL-enhanced framework significantly improves both the image quality
and human preference of generated images compared to the standard AR baselines.
Our results show consistent improvements across various evaluation metrics,
establishing the viability of RL-based optimization for AR image generation and
opening new avenues for controllable and high-quality image synthesis. The

TL;DR: CannyEdit是一种无需训练的文本到图像编辑框架，通过选择性Canny控制和双提示引导，平衡文本依从性和上下文保真度，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在文本依从性、上下文保真度和编辑无缝性方面存在不足，CannyEdit旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 采用选择性Canny控制（保留未编辑区域细节）和双提示引导（局部与全局提示结合）实现精确编辑。

Result: 在真实图像编辑任务中，CannyEdit在文本依从性和上下文保真度上提升2.93%至10.49%，且编辑结果更自然。

Conclusion: CannyEdit在无需训练的情况下，显著提升了图像编辑的质量和自然度，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) models have enabled training-free
regional image editing by leveraging the generative priors of foundation
models. However, existing methods struggle to balance text adherence in edited
regions, context fidelity in unedited areas, and seamless integration of edits.
We introduce CannyEdit, a novel training-free framework that addresses these
challenges through two key innovations: (1) Selective Canny Control, which
masks the structural guidance of Canny ControlNet in user-specified editable
regions while strictly preserving details of the source images in unedited
areas via inversion-phase ControlNet information retention. This enables
precise, text-driven edits without compromising contextual integrity. (2)
Dual-Prompt Guidance, which combines local prompts for object-specific edits
with a global target prompt to maintain coherent scene interactions. On
real-world image editing tasks (addition, replacement, removal), CannyEdit
outperforms prior methods like KV-Edit, achieving a 2.93 to 10.49 percent
improvement in the balance of text adherence and context fidelity. In terms of
editing seamlessness, user studies reveal only 49.2 percent of general users
and 42.0 percent of AIGC experts identified CannyEdit's results as AI-edited
when paired with real images without edits, versus 76.08 to 89.09 percent for
competitor methods.

providing significant improvements in the realism and naturalness of generated
outputs. However, the lack of standardized evaluation metrics for SLP
approaches hampers meaningful comparisons across different systems. To address
this, we introduce the first Sign Language Production Challenge, held as part
of the third SLRTP Workshop at CVPR 2025. The competition's aims are to
evaluate architectures that translate from spoken language sentences to a
sequence of skeleton poses, known as Text-to-Pose (T2P) translation, over a
range of metrics. For our evaluation data, we use the
RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather-2014T dataset, a German Sign Language - Deutsche
Gebardensprache (DGS) weather broadcast dataset. In addition, we curate a
custom hidden test set from a similar domain of discourse. This paper presents
the challenge design and the winning methodologies. The challenge attracted 33
participants who submitted 231 solutions, with the top-performing team
achieving BLEU-1 scores of 31.40 and DTW-MJE of 0.0574. The winning approach
utilized a retrieval-based framework and a pre-trained language model. As part
of the workshop, we release a standardized evaluation network, including
high-quality skeleton extraction-based keypoints establishing a consistent
baseline for the SLP field, which will enable future researchers to compare
their work against a broader range of methods.

*Qin Xu,Lili Zhu,Xiaoxia Cheng,Bo Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SCOPE的新方法，通过自适应增强空间域中的低层细节和高层语义表示能力，解决了频率域方法固定基函数的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决细粒度视觉分类（FGVC）中固定频率域方法无法动态适应图像内容和判别需求的问题。

Method: SCOPE包含两个模块：Subtle Detail Extractor（SDE）动态增强浅层特征中的细节，Salient Semantic Refiner（SSR）从高层特征中学习语义一致的细化特征。

Result: 在四个流行的细粒度图像分类基准上取得了新的最优性能。

Conclusion: SCOPE通过自适应多尺度融合，突破了频率域固定尺度的限制，显著提升了分类性能。

Abstract: The crux of resolving fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) lies in
capturing discriminative and class-specific cues that correspond to subtle
visual characteristics. Recently, frequency decomposition/transform based
approaches have attracted considerable interests since its appearing
discriminative cue mining ability. However, the frequency-domain methods are
based on fixed basis functions, lacking adaptability to image content and
unable to dynamically adjust feature extraction according to the discriminative
requirements of different images. To address this, we propose a novel method
for FGVC, named Subtle-Cue Oriented Perception Engine (SCOPE), which adaptively
enhances the representational capability of low-level details and high-level
semantics in the spatial domain, breaking through the limitations of fixed
scales in the frequency domain and improving the flexibility of multi-scale
fusion. The core of SCOPE lies in two modules: the Subtle Detail Extractor
(SDE), which dynamically enhances subtle details such as edges and textures
from shallow features, and the Salient Semantic Refiner (SSR), which learns
semantically coherent and structure-aware refinement features from the
high-level features guided by the enhanced shallow features. The SDE and SSR
are cascaded stage-by-stage to progressively combine local details with global
semantics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves new
state-of-the-art on four popular fine-grained image classification benchmarks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个针对文本到视频检索（T2VR）的对抗性攻击方法ViPro，旨在提升视频排名，并通过Modal Refinement（MoRe）增强黑盒迁移性。实验表明ViPro在多种场景下显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有T2VR攻击主要关注降低视频排名，而提升视频排名的攻击未被充分研究，但其潜在影响更大（如经济利益和误导信息传播）。

Method: 提出ViPro攻击方法，通过Modal Refinement（MoRe）捕捉视觉与文本模态的细粒度交互，增强黑盒迁移性。

Result: ViPro在白盒、灰盒和黑盒设置下平均分别超过基线方法30%、10%和4%。

Conclusion: ViPro揭示了T2VR的潜在漏洞，并提供了对抗性攻击的定性分析和防御建议。

Abstract: Thanks to the development of cross-modal models, text-to-video retrieval
(T2VR) is advancing rapidly, but its robustness remains largely unexamined.
Existing attacks against T2VR are designed to push videos away from queries,
i.e., suppressing the ranks of videos, while the attacks that pull videos
towards selected queries, i.e., promoting the ranks of videos, remain largely
unexplored. These attacks can be more impactful as attackers may gain more
views/clicks for financial benefits and widespread (mis)information. To this
end, we pioneer the first attack against T2VR to promote videos adversarially,
dubbed the Video Promotion attack (ViPro). We further propose Modal Refinement
(MoRe) to capture the finer-grained, intricate interaction between visual and
textual modalities to enhance black-box transferability. Comprehensive
experiments cover 2 existing baselines, 3 leading T2VR models, 3 prevailing
datasets with over 10k videos, evaluated under 3 scenarios. All experiments are
conducted in a multi-target setting to reflect realistic scenarios where
attackers seek to promote the video regarding multiple queries simultaneously.
We also evaluated our attacks for defences and imperceptibility. Overall, ViPro
surpasses other baselines by over $30/10/4\%$ for white/grey/black-box settings
on average. Our work highlights an overlooked vulnerability, provides a
qualitative analysis on the upper/lower bound of our attacks, and offers
insights into potential counterplays. Code will be publicly available at
https://github.com/michaeltian108/ViPro.

TL;DR: WeatherDiffusion是一种基于扩散模型的框架，用于自动驾驶场景中的正向和逆向渲染，支持天气和光照编辑，并通过提出的MAA机制提升渲染质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 复杂天气和光照条件对自动驾驶场景的理解和重建提出了挑战，现有扩散模型缺乏可控性和鲁棒性。

Method: 提出WeatherDiffusion框架，结合文本引导的预测本征图和MAA机制，实现高质量逆向渲染，并构建合成和真实数据集。

Result: 在多个基准测试中优于现有方法，并提升下游任务（如目标检测和图像分割）在恶劣天气下的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: WeatherDiffusion为自动驾驶场景的渲染和编辑提供了高效且可控的解决方案，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Forward and inverse rendering have emerged as key techniques for enabling
understanding and reconstruction in the context of autonomous driving (AD).
However, complex weather and illumination pose great challenges to this task.
The emergence of large diffusion models has shown promise in achieving
reasonable results through learning from 2D priors, but these models are
difficult to control and lack robustness. In this paper, we introduce
WeatherDiffusion, a diffusion-based framework for forward and inverse rendering
on AD scenes with various weather and lighting conditions. Our method enables
authentic estimation of material properties, scene geometry, and lighting, and
further supports controllable weather and illumination editing through the use
of predicted intrinsic maps guided by text descriptions. We observe that
different intrinsic maps should correspond to different regions of the original
image. Based on this observation, we propose Intrinsic map-aware attention
(MAA) to enable high-quality inverse rendering. Additionally, we introduce a
synthetic dataset (\ie WeatherSynthetic) and a real-world dataset (\ie
WeatherReal) for forward and inverse rendering on AD scenes with diverse
weather and lighting. Extensive experiments show that our WeatherDiffusion
outperforms state-of-the-art methods on several benchmarks. Moreover, our
method demonstrates significant value in downstream tasks for AD, enhancing the
robustness of object detection and image segmentation in challenging weather
scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法将检测与预测作为独立任务，无法充分利用时间线索。

Method: 采用多任务流式学习和双向学习，结合检测与预测的查询记忆和信息传播，使用预测感知检测变换器和流式预测变换器。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上表现优异，EPA达54.9%，超越先前方法9.3%，并在多视图检测与预测模型中取得最佳mAP和minADE。

Conclusion: ForeSight通过联合检测与预测，显著提升了自动驾驶车辆的3D感知能力。

Abstract: We introduce ForeSight, a novel joint detection and forecasting framework for
vision-based 3D perception in autonomous vehicles. Traditional approaches treat
detection and forecasting as separate sequential tasks, limiting their ability
to leverage temporal cues. ForeSight addresses this limitation with a
multi-task streaming and bidirectional learning approach, allowing detection
and forecasting to share query memory and propagate information seamlessly. The
forecast-aware detection transformer enhances spatial reasoning by integrating
trajectory predictions from a multiple hypothesis forecast memory queue, while
the streaming forecast transformer improves temporal consistency using past
forecasts and refined detections. Unlike tracking-based methods, ForeSight
eliminates the need for explicit object association, reducing error propagation
with a tracking-free model that efficiently scales across multi-frame
sequences. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset show that ForeSight achieves
state-of-the-art performance, achieving an EPA of 54.9%, surpassing previous
methods by 9.3%, while also attaining the best mAP and minADE among multi-view
detection and forecasting models.

Motivation: 现有方法对复杂结构和高度变形的文档图像去扭曲效果不佳，需更接近物理场景的动态建模。

Result: 实验表明TADoc在多种文档类型和变形程度下表现优越，具有强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 动态建模和DLS指标有效提升了文档去扭曲任务的性能与评价全面性。

Abstract: Flattening curved, wrinkled, and rotated document images captured by portable
photographing devices, termed document image dewarping, has become an
increasingly important task with the rise of digital economy and online
working. Although many methods have been proposed recently, they often struggle
to achieve satisfactory results when confronted with intricate document
structures and higher degrees of deformation in real-world scenarios. Our main
insight is that, unlike other document restoration tasks (e.g., deblurring),
dewarping in real physical scenes is a progressive motion rather than a
one-step transformation. Based on this, we have undertaken two key initiatives.
Firstly, we reformulate this task, modeling it for the first time as a dynamic
process that encompasses a series of intermediate states. Secondly, we design a
lightweight framework called TADoc (Time-Aware Document Dewarping Network) to
address the geometric distortion of document images. In addition, due to the
inadequacy of OCR metrics for document images containing sparse text, the
comprehensiveness of evaluation is insufficient. To address this shortcoming,
we propose a new metric -- DLS (Document Layout Similarity) -- to evaluate the
effectiveness of document dewarping in downstream tasks. Extensive experiments
and in-depth evaluations have been conducted and the results indicate that our
model possesses strong robustness, achieving superiority on several benchmarks
with different document types and degrees of distortion.

Motivation: 现有方法因数据不足或训练方式隐式（如预测像素级未来帧）导致泛化能力有限，需改进。

Method: 提出基于关键点的视觉语言模型预训练方案，通过类比推理（AR）将人类手部动作映射到机器人组件。

Result: 在CALVIN基准测试和真实实验中表现领先，少样本场景下显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 显式模仿人类动作在数据稀缺时更有效，AR-VRM方法具有优越性。

Abstract: Visual Robot Manipulation (VRM) aims to enable a robot to follow natural
language instructions based on robot states and visual observations, and
therefore requires costly multi-modal data. To compensate for the deficiency of
robot data, existing approaches have employed vision-language pretraining with
large-scale data. However, they either utilize web data that differs from
robotic tasks, or train the model in an implicit way (e.g., predicting future
frames at the pixel level), thus showing limited generalization ability under
insufficient robot data. In this paper, we propose to learn from large-scale
human action video datasets in an explicit way (i.e., imitating human actions
from hand keypoints), introducing Visual Robot Manipulation with Analogical
Reasoning (AR-VRM). To acquire action knowledge explicitly from human action
videos, we propose a keypoint Vision-Language Model (VLM) pretraining scheme,
enabling the VLM to learn human action knowledge and directly predict human
hand keypoints. During fine-tuning on robot data, to facilitate the robotic arm
in imitating the action patterns of human motions, we first retrieve human
action videos that perform similar manipulation tasks and have similar
historical observations , and then learn the Analogical Reasoning (AR) map
between human hand keypoints and robot components. Taking advantage of focusing
on action keypoints instead of irrelevant visual cues, our method achieves
leading performance on the CALVIN benchmark {and real-world experiments}. In
few-shot scenarios, our AR-VRM outperforms previous methods by large margins ,
underscoring the effectiveness of explicitly imitating human actions under data
scarcity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OctreeNCA提出了一种基于八叉树数据结构的轻量级神经网络模型，用于高效分割高分辨率医学图像和视频，显著降低VRAM消耗并提升推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像和视频分割需要全局上下文，但传统模型（如UNet或Vision Transformers）因VRAM限制无法一次性处理大输入，导致全局一致性和推理速度下降。

Method: 通过八叉树数据结构扩展NCA的邻域定义，实现全局知识的高效传递，并开发了CUDA实现的NCA推理函数以减少VRAM需求。

Result: OctreeNCA在评估时比UNet减少90%的VRAM占用，可一次性分割184兆像素的病理切片或1分钟的手术视频。

Conclusion: OctreeNCA是一种高效且轻量级的解决方案，适用于大输入医学图像和视频的快速分割。

Abstract: Medical applications demand segmentation of large inputs, like prostate MRIs,
pathology slices, or videos of surgery. These inputs should ideally be inferred
at once to provide the model with proper spatial or temporal context. When
segmenting large inputs, the VRAM consumption of the GPU becomes the
bottleneck. Architectures like UNets or Vision Transformers scale very poorly
in VRAM consumption, resulting in patch- or frame-wise approaches that
compromise global consistency and inference speed. The lightweight Neural
Cellular Automaton (NCA) is a bio-inspired model that is by construction
size-invariant. However, due to its local-only communication rules, it lacks
global knowledge. We propose OctreeNCA by generalizing the neighborhood
definition using an octree data structure. Our generalized neighborhood
definition enables the efficient traversal of global knowledge. Since deep
learning frameworks are mainly developed for large multi-layer networks, their
implementation does not fully leverage the advantages of NCAs. We implement an
NCA inference function in CUDA that further reduces VRAM demands and increases
inference speed. Our OctreeNCA segments high-resolution images and videos
quickly while occupying 90% less VRAM than a UNet during evaluation. This
allows us to segment 184 Megapixel pathology slices or 1-minute surgical videos
at once.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅在单视角投影平面中法线对齐时，切换视角会出现几何偏差，需解决多视角场景中的距离和全局匹配问题。

Method: 设计了多视角距离重投影正则化模块和多视角法线增强模块，通过约束邻近深度图和对齐3D法线实现几何深度统一。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在定量和定性评估中均优于基线，显著提升了3D高斯泼溅的表面重建能力。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了多视角几何偏差问题，实现了高精度重建。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) achieves remarkable results in the field of
surface reconstruction. However, when Gaussian normal vectors are aligned
within the single-view projection plane, while the geometry appears reasonable
in the current view, biases may emerge upon switching to nearby views. To
address the distance and global matching challenges in multi-view scenes, we
design multi-view normal and distance-guided Gaussian splatting. This method
achieves geometric depth unification and high-accuracy reconstruction by
constraining nearby depth maps and aligning 3D normals. Specifically, for the
reconstruction of small indoor and outdoor scenes, we propose a multi-view
distance reprojection regularization module that achieves multi-view Gaussian
alignment by computing the distance loss between two nearby views and the same
Gaussian surface. Additionally, we develop a multi-view normal enhancement
module, which ensures consistency across views by matching the normals of pixel
points in nearby views and calculating the loss. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that our method outperforms the baseline in both quantitative and
qualitative evaluations, significantly enhancing the surface reconstruction
capability of 3DGS.

Result: 在多个基准测试中显著优于现有SOTA模型，如COCO上AP提升6.9。

Conclusion: S2-UniSeg通过高效算法和连续优化，实现了自监督分割的显著性能提升。

Abstract: Recent self-supervised image segmentation models have achieved promising
performance on semantic segmentation and class-agnostic instance segmentation.
However, their pretraining schedule is multi-stage, requiring a time-consuming
pseudo-masks generation process between each training epoch. This
time-consuming offline process not only makes it difficult to scale with
training dataset size, but also leads to sub-optimal solutions due to its
discontinuous optimization routine. To solve these, we first present a novel
pseudo-mask algorithm, Fast Universal Agglomerative Pooling (UniAP). Each layer
of UniAP can identify groups of similar nodes in parallel, allowing to generate
both semantic-level and instance-level and multi-granular pseudo-masks within
ens of milliseconds for one image. Based on the fast UniAP, we propose the
Scalable Self-Supervised Universal Segmentation (S2-UniSeg), which employs a
student and a momentum teacher for continuous pretraining. A novel
segmentation-oriented pretext task, Query-wise Self-Distillation (QuerySD), is
proposed to pretrain S2-UniSeg to learn the local-to-global correspondences.
Under the same setting, S2-UniSeg outperforms the SOTA UnSAM model, achieving
notable improvements of AP+6.9 on COCO, AR+11.1 on UVO, PixelAcc+4.5 on
COCOStuff-27, RQ+8.0 on Cityscapes. After scaling up to a larger 2M-image
subset of SA-1B, S2-UniSeg further achieves performance gains on all four
benchmarks. Our code and pretrained models are available at

Conclusion: TerraMAE为高光谱图像分析提供了一种高效的自监督表示学习方法，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Hyperspectral satellite imagery offers sub-30 m views of Earth in hundreds of
contiguous spectral bands, enabling fine-grained mapping of soils, crops, and
land cover. While self-supervised Masked Autoencoders excel on RGB and low-band
multispectral data, they struggle to exploit the intricate spatial-spectral
correlations in 200+ band hyperspectral images. We introduce TerraMAE, a novel
HSI encoding framework specifically designed to learn highly representative
spatial-spectral embeddings for diverse geospatial analyses. TerraMAE features
an adaptive channel grouping strategy, based on statistical reflectance
properties to capture spectral similarities, and an enhanced reconstruction
loss function that incorporates spatial and spectral quality metrics. We
demonstrate TerraMAE's effectiveness through superior spatial-spectral
information preservation in high-fidelity image reconstruction. Furthermore, we
validate its practical utility and the quality of its learned representations
through strong performance on three key downstream geospatial tasks: crop
identification, land cover classification, and soil texture prediction.

Abstract: Complex Visual Question Answering (Complex VQA) tasks, which demand
sophisticated multi-modal reasoning and external knowledge integration, present
significant challenges for existing large vision-language models (LVLMs) often
limited by their reliance on high-level global features. To address this, we
propose MV-CoRe (Multimodal Visual-Conceptual Reasoning), a novel model
designed to enhance Complex VQA performance through the deep fusion of diverse
visual and linguistic information. MV-CoRe meticulously integrates global
embeddings from pre-trained Vision Large Models (VLMs) and Language Large
Models (LLMs) with fine-grained semantic-aware visual features, including
object detection characteristics and scene graph representations. An innovative
Multimodal Fusion Transformer then processes and deeply integrates these
diverse feature sets, enabling rich cross-modal attention and facilitating
complex reasoning. We evaluate MV-CoRe on challenging Complex VQA benchmarks,
including GQA, A-OKVQA, and OKVQA, after training on VQAv2. Our experimental
results demonstrate that MV-CoRe consistently outperforms established LVLM
baselines, achieving an overall accuracy of 77.5% on GQA. Ablation studies
confirm the critical contribution of both object and scene graph features, and
human evaluations further validate MV-CoRe's superior factual correctness and
reasoning depth, underscoring its robust capabilities for deep visual and

Conclusion: FOCUS-Med展示了其在AI辅助结肠镜检查中的有效性和临床潜力。

Abstract: Accurate endoscopic image segmentation on the polyps is critical for early
colorectal cancer detection. However, this task remains challenging due to low
contrast with surrounding mucosa, specular highlights, and indistinct
boundaries. To address these challenges, we propose FOCUS-Med, which stands for
Fusion of spatial and structural graph with attentional context-aware polyp
segmentation in endoscopic medical imaging. FOCUS-Med integrates a Dual Graph
Convolutional Network (Dual-GCN) module to capture contextual spatial and
topological structural dependencies. This graph-based representation enables
the model to better distinguish polyps from background tissues by leveraging
topological cues and spatial connectivity, which are often obscured in raw
image intensities. It enhances the model's ability to preserve boundaries and
delineate complex shapes typical of polyps. In addition, a location-fused
stand-alone self-attention is employed to strengthen global context
integration. To bridge the semantic gap between encoder-decoder layers, we
incorporate a trainable weighted fast normalized fusion strategy for efficient
multi-scale aggregation. Notably, we are the first to introduce the use of a
Large Language Model (LLM) to provide detailed qualitative evaluations of
segmentation quality. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate
that FOCUS-Med achieves state-of-the-art performance across five key metrics,
underscoring its effectiveness and clinical potential for AI-assisted

Result: TeSO结合压缩方案，在较低比特率下实现了比点云和3D高斯基线更高的渲染质量。

Conclusion: TeSO是一种高效且高质量的3D表示方法，适用于3D流媒体和AR/VR应用。

Abstract: 3D visual content streaming is a key technology for emerging 3D telepresence
and AR/VR applications. One fundamental element underlying the technology is a
versatile 3D representation that is capable of producing high-quality renders
and can be efficiently compressed at the same time. Existing 3D representations
like point clouds, meshes and 3D Gaussians each have limitations in terms of
rendering quality, surface definition, and compressibility. In this paper, we
present the Textured Surfel Octree (TeSO), a novel 3D representation that is
built from point clouds but addresses the aforementioned limitations. It
represents a 3D scene as cube-bounded surfels organized on an octree, where
each surfel is further associated with a texture patch. By approximating a
smooth surface with a large surfel at a coarser level of the octree, it reduces
the number of primitives required to represent the 3D scene, and yet retains
the high-frequency texture details through the texture map attached to each
surfel. We further propose a compression scheme to encode the geometry and
texture efficiently, leveraging the octree structure. The proposed textured
surfel octree combined with the compression scheme achieves higher rendering
quality at lower bit-rates compared to multiple point cloud and 3D
Gaussian-based baselines.

Motivation: 协作3D检测通过信息交换提升性能，但面临检测性能与通信带宽的权衡问题。

Method: 提出混合协作方法，自适应整合感知输出和原始观测信息，并优先处理关键数据。

Result: HyComm在DAIR-V2X和OPV2V数据集上表现优异，通信量降低2006倍以上，AP50优于Where2comm。

Conclusion: HyComm通过自适应消息选择和标准化数据格式，实现了高效协作检测，适用于不同代理配置。

Abstract: Collaborative 3D detection can substantially boost detection performance by
allowing agents to exchange complementary information. It inherently results in
a fundamental trade-off between detection performance and communication
bandwidth. To tackle this bottleneck issue, we propose a novel hybrid
collaboration that adaptively integrates two types of communication messages:
perceptual outputs, which are compact, and raw observations, which offer richer
information. This approach focuses on two key aspects: i) integrating
complementary information from two message types and ii) prioritizing the most
critical data within each type. By adaptively selecting the most critical set
of messages, it ensures optimal perceptual information and adaptability,
effectively meeting the demands of diverse communication scenarios.Building on
this hybrid collaboration, we present \texttt{HyComm}, a
communication-efficient LiDAR-based collaborative 3D detection system.
\texttt{HyComm} boasts two main benefits: i) it facilitates adaptable
compression rates for messages, addressing various communication requirements,
and ii) it uses standardized data formats for messages. This ensures they are
independent of specific detection models, fostering adaptability across
different agent configurations. To evaluate HyComm, we conduct experiments on
both real-world and simulation datasets: DAIR-V2X and OPV2V. HyComm
consistently outperforms previous methods and achieves a superior
performance-bandwidth trade-off regardless of whether agents use the same or
varied detection models. It achieves a lower communication volume of more than
2,006$\times$ and still outperforms Where2comm on DAIR-V2X in terms of AP50.
The related code will be released.

Motivation: 现有基于提升的方法在跨数据集和实际场景中泛化能力较差，AugLift旨在解决这一问题。

Method: AugLift在标准2D关键点坐标基础上，稀疏地加入关键点检测置信度和深度估计，利用预训练模型计算这些信号。

Result: 实验显示，AugLift在未见数据集上平均提升10.1%性能，在分布内数据上提升4.0%。

Conclusion: AugLift是一种模块化方法，可轻松集成到现有架构中，显著提升泛化能力。

Abstract: Lifting-based methods for 3D Human Pose Estimation (HPE), which predict 3D
poses from detected 2D keypoints, often generalize poorly to new datasets and
real-world settings. To address this, we propose \emph{AugLift}, a simple yet
effective reformulation of the standard lifting pipeline that significantly
improves generalization performance without requiring additional data
collection or sensors. AugLift sparsely enriches the standard input -- the 2D
keypoint coordinates $(x, y)$ -- by augmenting it with a keypoint detection
confidence score $c$ and a corresponding depth estimate $d$. These additional
signals are computed from the image using off-the-shelf, pre-trained models
(e.g., for monocular depth estimation), thereby inheriting their strong
generalization capabilities. Importantly, AugLift serves as a modular add-on
and can be readily integrated into existing lifting architectures.
  Our extensive experiments across four datasets demonstrate that AugLift
boosts cross-dataset performance on unseen datasets by an average of $10.1\%$,
while also improving in-distribution performance by $4.0\%$. These gains are
consistent across various lifting architectures, highlighting the robustness of
our method. Our analysis suggests that these sparse, keypoint-aligned cues
provide robust frame-level context, offering a practical way to significantly
improve the generalization of any lifting-based pose estimation model. Code
will be made publicly available.

Result: DMs生成图像更真实，但GANs在特定条件下（如ECS缺失）更准确。

Conclusion: GANs和DMs各有优势，需进一步优化以可靠增强AI诊断系统的训练数据。

Abstract: Generative image models have achieved remarkable progress in both natural and
medical imaging. In the medical context, these techniques offer a potential
solution to data scarcity-especially for low-prevalence anomalies that impair
the performance of AI-driven diagnostic and segmentation tools. However,
questions remain regarding the fidelity and clinical utility of synthetic
images, since poor generation quality can undermine model generalizability and
trust. In this study, we evaluate the effectiveness of state-of-the-art
generative models-Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Diffusion Models
(DMs)-for synthesizing chest X-rays conditioned on four abnormalities:
Atelectasis (AT), Lung Opacity (LO), Pleural Effusion (PE), and Enlarged
Cardiac Silhouette (ECS). Using a benchmark composed of real images from the
MIMIC-CXR dataset and synthetic images from both GANs and DMs, we conducted a
reader study with three radiologists of varied experience. Participants were
asked to distinguish real from synthetic images and assess the consistency
between visual features and the target abnormality. Our results show that while
DMs generate more visually realistic images overall, GANs can report better
accuracy for specific conditions, such as absence of ECS. We further identify
visual cues radiologists use to detect synthetic images, offering insights into
the perceptual gaps in current models. These findings underscore the
complementary strengths of GANs and DMs and point to the need for further
refinement to ensure generative models can reliably augment training datasets
for AI diagnostic systems.

Conclusion: CMAMRNet有效提升了壁画修复的质量和艺术真实性，代码已开源。

Abstract: Murals, as invaluable cultural artifacts, face continuous deterioration from
environmental factors and human activities. Digital restoration of murals faces
unique challenges due to their complex degradation patterns and the critical
need to preserve artistic authenticity. Existing learning-based methods
struggle with maintaining consistent mask guidance throughout their networks,
leading to insufficient focus on damaged regions and compromised restoration
quality. We propose CMAMRNet, a Contextual Mask-Aware Mural Restoration Network
that addresses these limitations through comprehensive mask guidance and
multi-scale feature extraction. Our framework introduces two key components:
(1) the Mask-Aware Up/Down-Sampler (MAUDS), which ensures consistent mask
sensitivity across resolution scales through dedicated channel-wise feature
selection and mask-guided feature fusion; and (2) the Co-Feature Aggregator
(CFA), operating at both the highest and lowest resolutions to extract
complementary features for capturing fine textures and global structures in
degraded regions. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
CMAMRNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods, effectively preserving both
structural integrity and artistic details in restored murals. The code is

Motivation: 现有HVM模型依赖大规模预训练数据和复杂架构，限制了实际应用。DPAL旨在通过知识蒸馏解决这一问题。

Method: 设计了动态模式解码器（D-PaDe）和三种对齐目标，分别从全局图像、局部像素和实例关系层面缩小轻量级与大型HVM模型的泛化差距。

Result: 在15个数据集上的实验表明，DPAL-ViT/Ti（5M参数）表现接近大型HVM模型（如84M的PATH-B），并显著优于其他蒸馏方法。

Conclusion: DPAL通过动态模式对齐学习，成功实现了轻量级HVM模型的高效训练和强大泛化能力。

Abstract: Human-centric vision models (HVMs) have achieved remarkable generalization
due to large-scale pretraining on massive person images. However, their
dependence on large neural architectures and the restricted accessibility of
pretraining data significantly limits their practicality in real-world
applications. To address this limitation, we propose Dynamic Pattern Alignment
Learning (DPAL), a novel distillation-based pretraining framework that
efficiently trains lightweight HVMs to acquire strong generalization from large
HVMs. In particular, human-centric visual perception are highly dependent on
three typical visual patterns, including global identity pattern, local shape
pattern and multi-person interaction pattern. To achieve generalizable
lightweight HVMs, we firstly design a dynamic pattern decoder (D-PaDe), acting
as a dynamic Mixture of Expert (MoE) model. It incorporates three specialized
experts dedicated to adaptively extract typical visual patterns, conditioned on
both input image and pattern queries. And then, we present three levels of
alignment objectives, which aims to minimize generalization gap between
lightweight HVMs and large HVMs at global image level, local pixel level, and
instance relation level. With these two deliberate designs, the DPAL
effectively guides lightweight model to learn all typical human visual patterns
from large HVMs, which can generalize to various human-centric vision tasks.
Extensive experiments conducted on 15 challenging datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of the DPAL. Remarkably, when employing PATH-B as the teacher,
DPAL-ViT/Ti (5M parameters) achieves surprising generalizability similar to
existing large HVMs such as PATH-B (84M) and Sapiens-L (307M), and outperforms
previous distillation-based pretraining methods including Proteus-ViT/Ti (5M)
and TinyMiM-ViT/Ti (5M) by a large margin.

Conclusion: 提出的框架通过显式建模意图和优化扩散过程，显著提升了行人轨迹预测的准确性。

Abstract: Predicting pedestrian motion trajectories is critical for the path planning
and motion control of autonomous vehicles. Recent diffusion-based models have
shown promising results in capturing the inherent stochasticity of pedestrian
behavior for trajectory prediction. However, the absence of explicit semantic
modelling of pedestrian intent in many diffusion-based methods may result in
misinterpreted behaviors and reduced prediction accuracy. To address the above
challenges, we propose a diffusion-based pedestrian trajectory prediction
framework that incorporates both short-term and long-term motion intentions.
Short-term intent is modelled using a residual polar representation, which
decouples direction and magnitude to capture fine-grained local motion
patterns. Long-term intent is estimated through a learnable, token-based
endpoint predictor that generates multiple candidate goals with associated
probabilities, enabling multimodal and context-aware intention modelling.
Furthermore, we enhance the diffusion process by incorporating adaptive
guidance and a residual noise predictor that dynamically refines denoising
accuracy. The proposed framework is evaluated on the widely used ETH, UCY, and
SDD benchmarks, demonstrating competitive results against state-of-the-art
methods.

Result: 模型生成的草图视频保留了原始外观并模仿了参考视频的动态运动。

Conclusion: SketchAnimator在一次性运动定制挑战中表现优于其他方法。

Abstract: Sketching is a uniquely human tool for expressing ideas and creativity. The
animation of sketches infuses life into these static drawings, opening a new
dimension for designers. Animating sketches is a time-consuming process that
demands professional skills and extensive experience, often proving daunting
for amateurs. In this paper, we propose a novel sketch animation model
SketchAnimator, which enables adding creative motion to a given sketch, like "a
jumping car''. Namely, given an input sketch and a reference video, we divide
the sketch animation into three stages: Appearance Learning, Motion Learning
and Video Prior Distillation. In stages 1 and 2, we utilize LoRA to integrate
sketch appearance information and motion dynamics from the reference video into
the pre-trained T2V model. In the third stage, we utilize Score Distillation
Sampling (SDS) to update the parameters of the Bezier curves in each sketch
frame according to the acquired motion information. Consequently, our model
produces a sketch video that not only retains the original appearance of the
sketch but also mirrors the dynamic movements of the reference video. We
compare our method with alternative approaches and demonstrate that it
generates the desired sketch video under the challenge of one-shot motion
customization.

Conclusion: 解耦建模和接触一致性约束能有效提升3D人-物交互预测性能。

Abstract: 3D human-object interaction (HOI) anticipation aims to predict the future
motion of humans and their manipulated objects, conditioned on the historical
context. Generally, the articulated humans and rigid objects exhibit different
motion patterns, due to their distinct intrinsic physical properties. However,
this distinction is ignored by most of the existing works, which intend to
capture the dynamics of both humans and objects within a single prediction
model. In this work, we propose a novel contact-consistent decoupled diffusion
framework CoopDiff, which employs two distinct branches to decouple human and
object motion modeling, with the human-object contact points as shared anchors
to bridge the motion generation across branches. The human dynamics branch is
aimed to predict highly structured human motion, while the object dynamics
branch focuses on the object motion with rigid translations and rotations.
These two branches are bridged by a series of shared contact points with
consistency constraint for coherent human-object motion prediction. To further
enhance human-object consistency and prediction reliability, we propose a
human-driven interaction module to guide object motion modeling. Extensive
experiments on the BEHAVE and Human-object Interaction datasets demonstrate
that our CoopDiff outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment out the object in
a video referred by an expression. Current RVOS methods view referring
expressions as unstructured sequences, neglecting their crucial semantic
structure essential for referent reasoning. Besides, in contrast to
image-referring expressions whose semantics focus only on object attributes and
object-object relations, video-referring expressions also encompass event
attributes and event-event temporal relations. This complexity challenges
traditional structured reasoning image approaches. In this paper, we propose
the Event Referential Reasoning (EventRR) framework. EventRR decouples RVOS
into object summarization part and referent reasoning part. The summarization
phase begins by summarizing each frame into a set of bottleneck tokens, which
are then efficiently aggregated in the video-level summarization step to
exchange the global cross-modal temporal context. For reasoning part, EventRR
extracts semantic eventful structure of a video-referring expression into
highly expressive Referential Event Graph (REG), which is a single-rooted
directed acyclic graph. Guided by topological traversal of REG, we propose
Temporal Concept-Role Reasoning (TCRR) to accumulate the referring score of
each temporal query from REG leaf nodes to root node. Each reasoning step can
be interpreted as a question-answer pair derived from the concept-role
relations in REG. Extensive experiments across four widely recognized benchmark
datasets, show that EventRR quantitatively and qualitatively outperforms
state-of-the-art RVOS methods. Code is available at

Conclusion: 深度信息与图像修复的联合训练显著提升了修复质量，同时新数据集为研究提供了丰富资源。

Abstract: Image restoration has seen substantial progress in recent years. However,
existing methods often neglect depth information, which hurts similarity
matching, results in attention distractions in shallow depth-of-field (DoF)
scenarios, and excessive enhancement of background content in deep DoF
settings. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel Depth-Guided
Network (DGN) for image restoration, together with a novel large-scale
high-resolution dataset. Specifically, the network consists of two interactive
branches: a depth estimation branch that provides structural guidance, and an
image restoration branch that performs the core restoration task. In addition,
the image restoration branch exploits intra-object similarity through
progressive window-based self-attention and captures inter-object similarity
via sparse non-local attention. Through joint training, depth features
contribute to improved restoration quality, while the enhanced visual features
from the restoration branch in turn help refine depth estimation. Notably, we
also introduce a new dataset for training and evaluation, consisting of 9,205
high-resolution images from 403 plant species, with diverse depth and texture
variations. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on several standard benchmarks and generalizes
well to unseen plant images, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了真实世界超分辨率中的退化建模问题，提升了性能。

Abstract: Unsupervised real-world super-resolution (SR) faces critical challenges due
to the complex, unknown degradation distributions in practical scenarios.
Existing methods struggle to generalize from synthetic low-resolution (LR) and
high-resolution (HR) image pairs to real-world data due to a significant domain
gap. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised real-world SR method based on
rectified flow to effectively capture and model real-world degradation,
synthesizing LR-HR training pairs with realistic degradation. Specifically,
given unpaired LR and HR images, we propose a novel Rectified Flow Degradation
Module (RFDM) that introduces degradation-transformed LR (DT-LR) images as
intermediaries. By modeling the degradation trajectory in a continuous and
invertible manner, RFDM better captures real-world degradation and enhances the
realism of generated LR images. Additionally, we propose a Fourier Prior Guided
Degradation Module (FGDM) that leverages structural information embedded in
Fourier phase components to ensure more precise modeling of real-world
degradation. Finally, the LR images are processed by both FGDM and RFDM,
producing final synthetic LR images with real-world degradation. The synthetic
LR images are paired with the given HR images to train the off-the-shelf SR
networks. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our
method significantly enhances the performance of existing SR approaches in
real-world scenarios.

Result: 实验表明CMB-Net优于现有大多数IML模型。

Conclusion: 通过结合语义和视觉信息，CMB-Net有效提升了图像篡改定位的准确性。

Abstract: The existing image manipulation localization (IML) models mainly relies on
visual cues, but ignores the semantic logical relationships between content
features. In fact, the content semantics conveyed by real images often conform
to human cognitive laws. However, image manipulation technology usually
destroys the internal relationship between content features, thus leaving
semantic clues for IML. In this paper, we propose a cognition-inspired
multimodal boundary-preserving network (CMB-Net). Specifically, CMB-Net
utilizes large language models (LLMs) to analyze manipulated regions within
images and generate prompt-based textual information to compensate for the lack
of semantic relationships in the visual information. Considering that the
erroneous texts induced by hallucination from LLMs will damage the accuracy of
IML, we propose an image-text central ambiguity module (ITCAM). It assigns
weights to the text features by quantifying the ambiguity between text and
image features, thereby ensuring the beneficial impact of textual information.
We also propose an image-text interaction module (ITIM) that aligns visual and
text features using a correlation matrix for fine-grained interaction. Finally,
inspired by invertible neural networks, we propose a restoration edge decoder
(RED) that mutually generates input and output features to preserve boundary
information in manipulated regions without loss. Extensive experiments show
that CMB-Net outperforms most existing IML models.

Abstract: Offline camera calibration techniques typically employ parametric or generic
camera models. Selecting parametric models relies heavily on user experience,
and an inappropriate camera model can significantly affect calibration
accuracy. Meanwhile, generic calibration methods involve complex procedures and
cannot provide traditional intrinsic parameters. This paper reveals a pose
ambiguity in the pose solutions of generic calibration methods that
irreversibly impacts subsequent pose estimation. A linear solver and a
nonlinear optimization are proposed to address this ambiguity issue. Then a
global optimization hybrid calibration method is introduced to integrate
generic and parametric models together, which improves extrinsic parameter
accuracy of generic calibration and mitigates overfitting and numerical
instability in parametric calibration. Simulation and real-world experimental
results demonstrate that the generic-parametric hybrid calibration method
consistently excels across various lens types and noise contamination,
hopefully serving as a reliable and accurate solution for camera calibration in
complex scenarios.

Abstract: Visual speech recognition is a technique to identify spoken content in silent
speech videos, which has raised significant attention in recent years.
Advancements in data-driven deep learning methods have significantly improved
both the speed and accuracy of recognition. However, these deep learning
methods can be effected by visual disturbances, such as lightning conditions,
skin texture and other user-specific features. Data-driven approaches could
reduce the performance degradation caused by these visual disturbances using
models pretrained on large-scale datasets. But these methods often require
large amounts of training data and computational resources, making them costly.
To reduce the influence of user-specific features and enhance performance with
limited data, this paper proposed a landmark guided visual feature extractor.
Facial landmarks are used as auxiliary information to aid in training the
visual feature extractor. A spatio-temporal multi-graph convolutional network
is designed to fully exploit the spatial locations and spatio-temporal features
of facial landmarks. Additionally, a multi-level lip dynamic fusion framework
is introduced to combine the spatio-temporal features of the landmarks with the
visual features extracted from the raw video frames. Experimental results show
that this approach performs well with limited data and also improves the
model's accuracy on unseen speakers.

TL;DR: ASM-UNet是一种基于Mamba的新型架构，通过自适应扫描分数动态调整扫描顺序，解决了精细分割中的个体差异问题，在多个数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有粗粒度分割方法在精细分割任务中表现不佳，且Mamba模型依赖固定扫描顺序，难以适应个体差异。

Method: 提出ASM-UNet，结合群体共性和个体差异生成自适应扫描分数，动态指导扫描顺序。

Result: 在ACDC、Synapse和BTMS数据集上，ASM-UNet在粗粒度和精细分割任务中均表现优异。

Conclusion: ASM-UNet通过动态扫描顺序解决了精细分割中的个体差异问题，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Precise lesion resection depends on accurately identifying fine-grained
anatomical structures. While many coarse-grained segmentation (CGS) methods
have been successful in large-scale segmentation (e.g., organs), they fall
short in clinical scenarios requiring fine-grained segmentation (FGS), which
remains challenging due to frequent individual variations in small-scale
anatomical structures. Although recent Mamba-based models have advanced medical
image segmentation, they often rely on fixed manually-defined scanning orders,
which limit their adaptability to individual variations in FGS. To address
this, we propose ASM-UNet, a novel Mamba-based architecture for FGS. It
introduces adaptive scan scores to dynamically guide the scanning order,
generated by combining group-level commonalities and individual-level
variations. Experiments on two public datasets (ACDC and Synapse) and a newly
proposed challenging biliary tract FGS dataset, namely BTMS, demonstrate that
ASM-UNet achieves superior performance in both CGS and FGS tasks. Our code and
dataset are available at https://github.com/YqunYang/ASM-UNet.

TL;DR: MiraMo框架通过高效线性注意力、运动残差学习和DCT噪声优化，提升图像动画的效率和一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决图像动画中外观一致性和运动平滑性的挑战，同时降低计算复杂度。

Method: 引入高效线性注意力、运动残差学习和DCT噪声优化策略。

Result: 实验验证MiraMo在生成一致性、平滑性和可控性动画上的优越性。

Conclusion: MiraMo在图像动画领域表现出高效、一致和可控的优势，适用于多种任务。

Abstract: Image animation has seen significant progress, driven by the powerful
generative capabilities of diffusion models. However, maintaining appearance
consistency with static input images and mitigating abrupt motion transitions
in generated animations remain persistent challenges. While text-to-video (T2V)
generation has demonstrated impressive performance with diffusion transformer
models, the image animation field still largely relies on U-Net-based diffusion
models, which lag behind the latest T2V approaches. Moreover, the quadratic
complexity of vanilla self-attention mechanisms in Transformers imposes heavy
computational demands, making image animation particularly resource-intensive.
To address these issues, we propose MiraMo, a framework designed to enhance
efficiency, appearance consistency, and motion smoothness in image animation.
Specifically, MiraMo introduces three key elements: (1) A foundational
text-to-video architecture replacing vanilla self-attention with efficient
linear attention to reduce computational overhead while preserving generation
quality; (2) A novel motion residual learning paradigm that focuses on modeling
motion dynamics rather than directly predicting frames, improving temporal
consistency; and (3) A DCT-based noise refinement strategy during inference to
suppress sudden motion artifacts, complemented by a dynamics control module to
balance motion smoothness and expressiveness. Extensive experiments against
state-of-the-art methods validate the superiority of MiraMo in generating
consistent, smooth, and controllable animations with accelerated inference
speed. Additionally, we demonstrate the versatility of MiraMo through
applications in motion transfer and video editing tasks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的高光谱视频跟踪方法，通过结合空间和光谱交互，解决了现有方法忽视光谱交互的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跟踪方法主要关注空间交互，忽略了光谱交互，导致性能不佳。

Method: 在架构层面，使用Transformer建立波段间的长程空间关系，并结合集合论的包含-排除原理建模光谱交互；在训练层面，引入光谱损失以增强模板与预测区域的材质分布对齐。

Result: 实验表明，该方法实现了最先进的跟踪性能。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效整合了空间和光谱信息，显著提升了跟踪性能，代码和模型已开源。

Abstract: Hyperspectral videos (HSVs), with their inherent spatial-spectral-temporal
structure, offer distinct advantages in challenging tracking scenarios such as
cluttered backgrounds and small objects. However, existing methods primarily
focus on spatial interactions between the template and search regions, often
overlooking spectral interactions, leading to suboptimal performance. To
address this issue, this paper investigates spectral interactions from both the
architectural and training perspectives. At the architectural level, we first
establish band-wise long-range spatial relationships between the template and
search regions using Transformers. We then model spectral interactions using
the inclusion-exclusion principle from set theory, treating them as the union
of spatial interactions across all bands. This enables the effective
integration of both shared and band-specific spatial cues. At the training
level, we introduce a spectral loss to enforce material distribution alignment
between the template and predicted regions, enhancing robustness to shape
deformation and appearance variations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our tracker achieves state-of-the-art tracking performance. The source code,
trained models and results will be publicly available via

Motivation: 现有数据集缺乏统一的4D标注和任务驱动的评估协议，无法支持细粒度的时空推理，尤其是物体和人的运动及其交互。

Method: 提出了EgoDynamic4D数据集，包含RGB-D视频、相机位姿、实例掩码和4D边界框，并设计了12个动态QA任务。提出了一种端到端的时空推理框架，结合动态和静态场景信息。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在EgoDynamic4D上优于基线，验证了多模态时序建模的有效性。

Conclusion: EgoDynamic4D和提出的框架为动态场景理解提供了新的基准和方法，支持细粒度的时空推理。

Abstract: Understanding dynamic 4D scenes from an egocentric perspective-modeling
changes in 3D spatial structure over time-is crucial for human-machine
interaction, autonomous navigation, and embodied intelligence. While existing
egocentric datasets contain dynamic scenes, they lack unified 4D annotations
and task-driven evaluation protocols for fine-grained spatio-temporal
reasoning, especially on motion of objects and human, together with their
interactions. To address this gap, we introduce EgoDynamic4D, a novel QA
benchmark on highly dynamic scenes, comprising RGB-D video, camera poses,
globally unique instance masks, and 4D bounding boxes. We construct 927K QA
pairs accompanied by explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT), enabling verifiable,
step-by-step spatio-temporal reasoning. We design 12 dynamic QA tasks covering
agent motion, human-object interaction, trajectory prediction, relation
understanding, and temporal-causal reasoning, with fine-grained,
multidimensional metrics. To tackle these tasks, we propose an end-to-end
spatio-temporal reasoning framework that unifies dynamic and static scene
information, using instance-aware feature encoding, time and camera encoding,
and spatially adaptive down-sampling to compress large 4D scenes into token
sequences manageable by LLMs. Experiments on EgoDynamic4D show that our method
consistently outperforms baselines, validating the effectiveness of multimodal
temporal modeling for egocentric dynamic scene understanding.

Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型（VLMs）虽然能力强，但训练成本高且难以个性化；小型VLMs易于个性化但推理能力不足。

Method: 提出Small-Large Collaboration（SLC）框架，小型VLM生成个性化信息，大型VLM整合信息并输出准确响应，采用测试时反射策略防止幻觉。

Result: 实验证明SLC框架在各种基准测试和大型VLMs中有效。

Conclusion: SLC是首个训练高效且支持开源和闭源大型VLMs的个性化框架，具有广泛的实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Personalizing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to transform them into daily
assistants has emerged as a trending research direction. However, leading
companies like OpenAI continue to increase model size and develop complex
designs such as the chain of thought (CoT). While large VLMs are proficient in
complex multi-modal understanding, their high training costs and limited access
via paid APIs restrict direct personalization. Conversely, small VLMs are
easily personalized and freely available, but they lack sufficient reasoning
capabilities. Inspired by this, we propose a novel collaborative framework
named Small-Large Collaboration (SLC) for large VLM personalization, where the
small VLM is responsible for generating personalized information, while the
large model integrates this personalized information to deliver accurate
responses. To effectively incorporate personalized information, we develop a
test-time reflection strategy, preventing the potential hallucination of the
small VLM. Since SLC only needs to train a meta personalized small VLM for the
large VLMs, the overall process is training-efficient. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first training-efficient framework that supports both
open-source and closed-source large VLMs, enabling broader real-world
personalized applications. We conduct thorough experiments across various
benchmarks and large VLMs to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SLC
framework. The code will be released at https://github.com/Hhankyangg/SLC.

Method: 提出OpenHAIV框架，统一OOD检测、新类发现和增量持续微调，支持模型自主知识获取与更新。

Result: OpenHAIV实现了在开放世界环境中模型的自主知识更新。

Conclusion: OpenHAIV为开放世界识别提供了一种有效的统一解决方案。

Abstract: Substantial progress has been made in various techniques for open-world
recognition. Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection methods can effectively
distinguish between known and unknown classes in the data, while incremental
learning enables continuous model knowledge updates. However, in open-world
scenarios, these approaches still face limitations. Relying solely on OOD
detection does not facilitate knowledge updates in the model, and incremental
fine-tuning typically requires supervised conditions, which significantly
deviate from open-world settings. To address these challenges, this paper
proposes OpenHAIV, a novel framework that integrates OOD detection, new class
discovery, and incremental continual fine-tuning into a unified pipeline. This
framework allows models to autonomously acquire and update knowledge in
open-world environments. The proposed framework is available at

Abstract: Understanding internal feature representations of deep neural networks (DNNs)
is a fundamental step toward model interpretability. Inspired by neuroscience
methods that probe biological neurons using visual stimuli, recent deep
learning studies have employed Activation Maximization (AM) to synthesize
inputs that elicit strong responses from artificial neurons. In this work, we
propose a unified feature visualization framework applicable to both
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs). Unlike
prior efforts that predominantly focus on the last output-layer neurons in
CNNs, we extend feature visualization to intermediate layers as well, offering
deeper insights into the hierarchical structure of learned feature
representations. Furthermore, we investigate how activation maximization can be
leveraged to generate adversarial examples, revealing potential vulnerabilities
and decision boundaries of DNNs. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
of our approach in both traditional CNNs and modern ViT, highlighting its
generalizability and interpretive value.

Result: 在SSL、WSL和BSL设置下表现优异，尤其在BSL中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SynMatch为医学图像分割提供了一种高效且无需额外参数的解决方案。

Abstract: Label scarcity remains a major challenge in deep learning-based medical image
segmentation. Recent studies use strong-weak pseudo supervision to leverage
unlabeled data. However, performance is often hindered by inconsistencies
between pseudo labels and their corresponding unlabeled images. In this work,
we propose \textbf{SynMatch}, a novel framework that sidesteps the need for
improving pseudo labels by synthesizing images to match them instead.
Specifically, SynMatch synthesizes images using texture and shape features
extracted from the same segmentation model that generates the corresponding
pseudo labels for unlabeled images. This design enables the generation of
highly consistent synthesized-image-pseudo-label pairs without requiring any
training parameters for image synthesis. We extensively evaluate SynMatch
across diverse medical image segmentation tasks under semi-supervised learning
(SSL), weakly-supervised learning (WSL), and barely-supervised learning (BSL)
settings with increasingly limited annotations. The results demonstrate that
SynMatch achieves superior performance, especially in the most challenging BSL
setting. For example, it outperforms the recent strong-weak pseudo
supervision-based method by 29.71\% and 10.05\% on the polyp segmentation task
with 5\% and 10\% scribble annotations, respectively. The code will be released

Abstract: Real-time semantic segmentation presents the dual challenge of designing
efficient architectures that capture large receptive fields for semantic
understanding while also refining detailed contours. Vision transformers model
long-range dependencies effectively but incur high computational cost. To
address these challenges, we introduce the Large Kernel Attention (LKA)
mechanism. Our proposed Bilateral Efficient Visual Attention Network (BEVANet)
expands the receptive field to capture contextual information and extracts
visual and structural features using Sparse Decomposed Large Separable Kernel
Attentions (SDLSKA). The Comprehensive Kernel Selection (CKS) mechanism
dynamically adapts the receptive field to further enhance performance.
Furthermore, the Deep Large Kernel Pyramid Pooling Module (DLKPPM) enriches
contextual features by synergistically combining dilated convolutions and large
kernel attention. The bilateral architecture facilitates frequent branch
communication, and the Boundary Guided Adaptive Fusion (BGAF) module enhances
boundary delineation by integrating spatial and semantic features under
boundary guidance. BEVANet achieves real-time segmentation at 33 FPS, yielding
79.3% mIoU without pretraining and 81.0% mIoU on Cityscapes after ImageNet
pretraining, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance. The code and model is

Result: DocR1在多页任务中达到最优性能，同时在单页任务中保持强劲表现。

Conclusion: EviGRPO框架和DocR1模型在多页文档理解任务中表现出色，为有限监督下的高质量模型训练提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Understanding multi-page documents poses a significant challenge for
multimodal large language models (MLLMs), as it requires fine-grained visual
comprehension and multi-hop reasoning across pages. While prior work has
explored reinforcement learning (RL) for enhancing advanced reasoning in MLLMs,
its application to multi-page document understanding remains underexplored. In
this paper, we introduce DocR1, an MLLM trained with a novel RL framework,
Evidence Page-Guided GRPO (EviGRPO). EviGRPO incorporates an evidence-aware
reward mechanism that promotes a coarse-to-fine reasoning strategy, guiding the
model to first retrieve relevant pages before generating answers. This training
paradigm enables us to build high-quality models with limited supervision. To
support this, we design a two-stage annotation pipeline and a curriculum
learning strategy, based on which we construct two datasets: EviBench, a
high-quality training set with 4.8k examples, and ArxivFullQA, an evaluation
benchmark with 8.6k QA pairs based on scientific papers. Extensive experiments
across a wide range of benchmarks demonstrate that DocR1 achieves
state-of-the-art performance on multi-page tasks, while consistently

Abstract: Image captioning aims to generate natural language descriptions for input
images in an open-form manner. To accurately generate descriptions related to
the image, a critical step in image captioning is to identify objects and
understand their relations within the image. Modern approaches typically
capitalize on object detectors or combine detectors with Graph Convolutional
Network (GCN). However, these models suffer from redundant detection
information, difficulty in GCN construction, and high training costs. To
address these issues, a Retrieval-based Objects and Relations Prompt for Image
Captioning (RORPCap) is proposed, inspired by the fact that image-text
retrieval can provide rich semantic information for input images. RORPCap
employs an Objects and relations Extraction Model to extract object and
relation words from the image. These words are then incorporate into predefined
prompt templates and encoded as prompt embeddings. Next, a Mamba-based mapping
network is designed to quickly map image embeddings extracted by CLIP to
visual-text embeddings. Finally, the resulting prompt embeddings and
visual-text embeddings are concatenated to form textual-enriched feature
embeddings, which are fed into a GPT-2 model for caption generation. Extensive
experiments conducted on the widely used MS-COCO dataset show that the RORPCap
requires only 2.6 hours under cross-entropy loss training, achieving 120.5%
CIDEr score and 22.0% SPICE score on the "Karpathy" test split. RORPCap
achieves comparable performance metrics to detector-based and GCN-based models
with the shortest training time and demonstrates its potential as an
alternative for image captioning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视频中语言与视觉对齐的复杂性，包括语言的多变性、实体的动态交互以及语义鸿沟。

Method: Planner模块分解复杂语言提示为短句链，Refiner模块通过自注意力机制优化视觉表示，逐步缩小语义差距。

Result: 在Referring Video Object Segmentation和Temporal Grounding任务中表现优于现有方法，尤其在复杂提示下。

Conclusion: Planner-Refiner框架有效解决了视频语言对齐的挑战，尤其在处理复杂语言时表现出色。

Abstract: Vision-language alignment in video must address the complexity of language,
evolving interacting entities, their action chains, and semantic gaps between
language and vision. This work introduces Planner-Refiner, a framework to
overcome these challenges. Planner-Refiner bridges the semantic gap by
iteratively refining visual elements' space-time representation, guided by
language until semantic gaps are minimal. A Planner module schedules language
guidance by decomposing complex linguistic prompts into short sentence chains.
The Refiner processes each short sentence, a noun-phrase and verb-phrase pair,
to direct visual tokens' self-attention across space then time, achieving
efficient single-step refinement. A recurrent system chains these steps,
maintaining refined visual token representations. The final representation
feeds into task-specific heads for alignment generation. We demonstrate
Planner-Refiner's effectiveness on two video-language alignment tasks:
Referring Video Object Segmentation and Temporal Grounding with varying
language complexity. We further introduce a new MeViS-X benchmark to assess
models' capability with long queries. Superior performance versus
state-of-the-art methods on these benchmarks shows the approach's potential,
especially for complex prompts.

TL;DR: CoAR提出了一种新的框架，通过冻结预训练参数，仅调整少量参数实现定制化图像生成，解决了现有方法的过拟合和计算成本问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有定制化生成方法依赖全微调或适配器，成本高且易过拟合或灾难性遗忘，因此需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: CoAR采用分层多模态上下文学习策略，学习特定主题表示，并引入正则化防止过拟合和语言漂移。

Result: CoAR在主题和风格个性化任务中表现优异，同时显著提升计算和内存效率。

Conclusion: CoAR通过极少量参数调整，实现了高效且性能优越的定制化生成。

Abstract: The unified autoregressive (AR) model excels at multimodal understanding and
generation, but its potential for customized image generation remains
underexplored. Existing customized generation methods rely on full fine-tuning
or adapters, making them costly and prone to overfitting or catastrophic
forgetting. In this paper, we propose \textbf{CoAR}, a novel framework for
injecting subject concepts into the unified AR models while keeping all
pre-trained parameters completely frozen. CoAR learns effective, specific
subject representations with only a minimal number of parameters using a
Layerwise Multimodal Context Learning strategy. To address overfitting and
language drift, we further introduce regularization that preserves the
pre-trained distribution and anchors context tokens to improve subject fidelity
and re-contextualization. Additionally, CoAR supports training-free subject
customization in a user-provided style. Experiments demonstrate that CoAR
achieves superior performance on both subject-driven personalization and style
personalization, while delivering significant gains in computational and memory
efficiency. Notably, CoAR tunes less than \textbf{0.05\%} of the parameters
while achieving competitive performance compared to recent Proxy-Tuning. Code:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: JPEG高压缩比会导致严重视觉伪影，现有深度学习方法难以恢复复杂纹理细节，导致输出过于平滑。

Method: 提出SODiff模型，结合语义对齐的图像提示提取器（SAIPE）和质量因子感知时间预测器，优化扩散过程。

Result: 实验表明，SODiff在视觉质量和定量指标上均优于现有领先方法。

Conclusion: SODiff通过语义导向和自适应时间预测，有效解决了JPEG伪影问题，具有显著优势。

Abstract: JPEG, as a widely used image compression standard, often introduces severe
visual artifacts when achieving high compression ratios. Although existing deep
learning-based restoration methods have made considerable progress, they often
struggle to recover complex texture details, resulting in over-smoothed
outputs. To overcome these limitations, we propose SODiff, a novel and
efficient semantic-oriented one-step diffusion model for JPEG artifacts
removal. Our core idea is that effective restoration hinges on providing
semantic-oriented guidance to the pre-trained diffusion model, thereby fully
leveraging its powerful generative prior. To this end, SODiff incorporates a
semantic-aligned image prompt extractor (SAIPE). SAIPE extracts rich features
from low-quality (LQ) images and projects them into an embedding space
semantically aligned with that of the text encoder. Simultaneously, it
preserves crucial information for faithful reconstruction. Furthermore, we
propose a quality factor-aware time predictor that implicitly learns the
compression quality factor (QF) of the LQ image and adaptively selects the
optimal denoising start timestep for the diffusion process. Extensive
experimental results show that our SODiff outperforms recent leading methods in
both visual quality and quantitative metrics. Code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 2DGS在大规模和复杂城市场景中表现不佳，导致建筑重建不完整。

Method: GS4Buildings直接从低细节语义3D建筑模型初始化高斯，并引入先验深度和法线图优化重建过程。

Result: 实验表明，GS4Buildings将重建完整性提升20.5%，几何精度提升32.8%，并减少71.8%的高斯基元。

Conclusion: 语义建筑模型集成可推动高斯泼溅重建技术在城市应用中的实际落地。

Abstract: Recent advances in Gaussian Splatting (GS) have demonstrated its
effectiveness in photo-realistic rendering and 3D reconstruction. Among these,
2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) is particularly suitable for surface
reconstruction due to its flattened Gaussian representation and integrated
normal regularization. However, its performance often degrades in large-scale
and complex urban scenes with frequent occlusions, leading to incomplete
building reconstructions. We propose GS4Buildings, a novel prior-guided
Gaussian Splatting method leveraging the ubiquity of semantic 3D building
models for robust and scalable building surface reconstruction. Instead of
relying on traditional Structure-from-Motion (SfM) pipelines, GS4Buildings
initializes Gaussians directly from low-level Level of Detail (LoD)2 semantic
3D building models. Moreover, we generate prior depth and normal maps from the
planar building geometry and incorporate them into the optimization process,
providing strong geometric guidance for surface consistency and structural
accuracy. We also introduce an optional building-focused mode that limits
reconstruction to building regions, achieving a 71.8% reduction in Gaussian
primitives and enabling a more efficient and compact representation.
Experiments on urban datasets demonstrate that GS4Buildings improves
reconstruction completeness by 20.5% and geometric accuracy by 32.8%. These
results highlight the potential of semantic building model integration to
advance GS-based reconstruction toward real-world urban applications such as
smart cities and digital twins. Our project is available:

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于模块分解和特征裁剪的方法，显著提升了跨传感器泛化能力，同时大幅降低了计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有预训练模型在跨传感器数据上泛化能力差，且现有解决方法（如重新训练或零样本方法）耗时或需额外数据。

Method: 通过模块分解定位关键接口，引入特征裁剪器，利用物理感知无监督损失高效训练，并采用分块并行推理提升效率。

Result: 在多个数据集上验证，方法在跨传感器情况下性能显著提升，训练和推理速度极快（如512x512图像仅需0.2秒）。

Conclusion: 该方法在质量和效率上均达到最优，为跨传感器问题提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Deep learning methods for pansharpening have advanced rapidly, yet models
pretrained on data from a specific sensor often generalize poorly to data from
other sensors. Existing methods to tackle such cross-sensor degradation include
retraining model or zero-shot methods, but they are highly time-consuming or
even need extra training data. To address these challenges, our method first
performs modular decomposition on deep learning-based pansharpening models,
revealing a general yet critical interface where high-dimensional fused
features begin mapping to the channel space of the final image. % may need
revisement A Feature Tailor is then integrated at this interface to address
cross-sensor degradation at the feature level, and is trained efficiently with
physics-aware unsupervised losses. Moreover, our method operates in a
patch-wise manner, training on partial patches and performing parallel
inference on all patches to boost efficiency. Our method offers two key
advantages: (1) $\textit{Improved Generalization Ability}$: it significantly
enhance performance in cross-sensor cases. (2) $\textit{Low Generalization
Cost}$: it achieves sub-second training and inference, requiring only partial
test inputs and no external data, whereas prior methods often take minutes or
even hours. Experiments on the real-world data from multiple datasets
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art quality and efficiency in
tackling cross-sensor degradation. For example, training and inference of
$512\times512\times8$ image within $\textit{0.2 seconds}$ and
$4000\times4000\times8$ image within $\textit{3 seconds}$ at the fastest
setting on a commonly used RTX 3090 GPU, which is over 100 times faster than
zero-shot methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS在多视图下表现优异，但在稀疏视图重建中效果不佳，因此提出DIP-GS以解决这一问题。

Method: 利用DIP先验，通过粗到细的方式优化3DGS，使其适用于稀疏视图场景。

Result: DIP-GS在稀疏视图重建任务中达到SOTA水平。

Conclusion: DIP-GS是一种高效且无需外部模型的稀疏视图重建方法。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a leading 3D scene reconstruction method,
obtaining high-quality reconstruction with real-time rendering runtime
performance. The main idea behind 3DGS is to represent the scene as a
collection of 3D gaussians, while learning their parameters to fit the given
views of the scene. While achieving superior performance in the presence of
many views, 3DGS struggles with sparse view reconstruction, where the input
views are sparse and do not fully cover the scene and have low overlaps. In
this paper, we propose DIP-GS, a Deep Image Prior (DIP) 3DGS representation. By
using the DIP prior, which utilizes internal structure and patterns, with
coarse-to-fine manner, DIP-based 3DGS can operate in scenarios where vanilla
3DGS fails, such as sparse view recovery. Note that our approach does not use
any pre-trained models such as generative models and depth estimation, but
rather relies only on the input frames. Among such methods, DIP-GS obtains
state-of-the-art (SOTA) competitive results on various sparse-view
reconstruction tasks, demonstrating its capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs无法有效处理事件流或仅能处理短序列，因此需要一种新方法来理解和分析长事件流。

Method: 采用自适应压缩机制减少输入事件量，保留关键细节；两阶段优化和文本引导的跨模态查询用于特征提取；构建大规模事件-文本对齐数据集。

Result: 实验表明，LET-US在长事件流的描述准确性和语义理解上优于现有MLLMs。

Conclusion: LET-US为长事件流的跨模态理解设立了新标准，并提供了公开的数据集和模型。

Abstract: Event cameras output event streams as sparse, asynchronous data with
microsecond-level temporal resolution, enabling visual perception with low
latency and a high dynamic range. While existing Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) have achieved significant success in understanding and analyzing
RGB video content, they either fail to interpret event streams effectively or
remain constrained to very short sequences. In this paper, we introduce LET-US,
a framework for long event-stream--text comprehension that employs an adaptive
compression mechanism to reduce the volume of input events while preserving
critical visual details. LET-US thus establishes a new frontier in cross-modal
inferential understanding over extended event sequences. To bridge the
substantial modality gap between event streams and textual representations, we
adopt a two-stage optimization paradigm that progressively equips our model
with the capacity to interpret event-based scenes. To handle the voluminous
temporal information inherent in long event streams, we leverage text-guided
cross-modal queries for feature reduction, augmented by hierarchical clustering
and similarity computation to distill the most representative event features.
Moreover, we curate and construct a large-scale event-text aligned dataset to
train our model, achieving tighter alignment of event features within the LLM
embedding space. We also develop a comprehensive benchmark covering a diverse
set of tasks -- reasoning, captioning, classification, temporal localization
and moment retrieval. Experimental results demonstrate that LET-US outperforms
prior state-of-the-art MLLMs in both descriptive accuracy and semantic
comprehension on long-duration event streams. All datasets, codes, and models
will be publicly available.

Motivation: 现有基于参数高效微调（PEFT）的方法忽视了其对对抗攻击的脆弱性，本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 通过注入伪造专家增强图像编码器的能力，设计轻量级对抗检测器，并在全局注意力层和MLP模块中注入对抗专家以纠正特征偏移。

Conclusion: ForensicsSAM为IFDL任务提供了一种高效且鲁棒的解决方案，显著提升了对抗攻击下的模型性能。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a popular strategy for
adapting large vision foundation models, such as the Segment Anything Model
(SAM) and LLaVA, to downstream tasks like image forgery detection and
localization (IFDL). However, existing PEFT-based approaches overlook their
vulnerability to adversarial attacks. In this paper, we show that highly
transferable adversarial images can be crafted solely via the upstream model,
without accessing the downstream model or training data, significantly
degrading the IFDL performance. To address this, we propose ForensicsSAM, a
unified IFDL framework with built-in adversarial robustness. Our design is
guided by three key ideas: (1) To compensate for the lack of forgery-relevant
knowledge in the frozen image encoder, we inject forgery experts into each
transformer block to enhance its ability to capture forgery artifacts. These
forgery experts are always activated and shared across any input images. (2) To
detect adversarial images, we design an light-weight adversary detector that
learns to capture structured, task-specific artifact in RGB domain, enabling
reliable discrimination across various attack methods. (3) To resist
adversarial attacks, we inject adversary experts into the global attention
layers and MLP modules to progressively correct feature shifts induced by
adversarial noise. These adversary experts are adaptively activated by the
adversary detector, thereby avoiding unnecessary interference with clean
images. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that
ForensicsSAM achieves superior resistance to various adversarial attack
methods, while also delivering state-of-the-art performance in image-level
forgery detection and pixel-level forgery localization. The resource is

Abstract: In this paper, we propose \textbf{CharacterShot}, a controllable and
consistent 4D character animation framework that enables any individual
designer to create dynamic 3D characters (i.e., 4D character animation) from a
single reference character image and a 2D pose sequence. We begin by
pretraining a powerful 2D character animation model based on a cutting-edge
DiT-based image-to-video model, which allows for any 2D pose sequnce as
controllable signal. We then lift the animation model from 2D to 3D through
introducing dual-attention module together with camera prior to generate
multi-view videos with spatial-temporal and spatial-view consistency. Finally,
we employ a novel neighbor-constrained 4D gaussian splatting optimization on
these multi-view videos, resulting in continuous and stable 4D character
representations. Moreover, to improve character-centric performance, we
construct a large-scale dataset Character4D, containing 13,115 unique
characters with diverse appearances and motions, rendered from multiple
viewpoints. Extensive experiments on our newly constructed benchmark,
CharacterBench, demonstrate that our approach outperforms current

Conclusion: CLUE为数字媒体真实性验证提供了一种高效且鲁棒的解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: The increasing accessibility of image editing tools and generative AI has led
to a proliferation of visually convincing forgeries, compromising the
authenticity of digital media. In this paper, in addition to leveraging
distortions from conventional forgeries, we repurpose the mechanism of a
state-of-the-art (SOTA) text-to-image synthesis model by exploiting its
internal generative process, turning it into a high-fidelity forgery
localization tool. To this end, we propose CLUE (Capture Latent Uncovered
Evidence), a framework that employs Low- Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to
parameter-efficiently reconfigure Stable Diffusion 3 (SD3) as a forensic
feature extractor. Our approach begins with the strategic use of SD3's
Rectified Flow (RF) mechanism to inject noise at varying intensities into the
latent representation, thereby steering the LoRAtuned denoising process to
amplify subtle statistical inconsistencies indicative of a forgery. To
complement the latent analysis with high-level semantic context and precise
spatial details, our method incorporates contextual features from the image
encoder of the Segment Anything Model (SAM), which is parameter-efficiently
adapted to better trace the boundaries of forged regions. Extensive evaluations
demonstrate CLUE's SOTA generalization performance, significantly outperforming
prior methods. Furthermore, CLUE shows superior robustness against common
post-processing attacks and Online Social Networks (OSNs). Code is publicly

Method: 采用反事实数据增强（CDA）和基于刻板印象程度的新方法（DAUDoS）进行去偏，并评估其效果。

Result: CDA减少性别差距6%，DAUDoS减少3%但仅用三分之一数据；两种方法均提升性别识别准确率3%。

Conclusion: 视觉编码器（CLIP）和文本编码器（PaliGemma2）的偏见贡献不同，未来可针对性优化。

Abstract: Vision Language Models achieve impressive multi-modal performance but often
inherit gender biases from their training data. This bias might be coming from
both the vision and text modalities. In this work, we dissect the contributions
of vision and text backbones to these biases by applying targeted debiasing
using Counterfactual Data Augmentation and Task Vector methods. Inspired by
data-efficient approaches in hate-speech classification, we introduce a novel
metric, Degree of Stereotypicality and a corresponding debiasing method, Data
Augmentation Using Degree of Stereotypicality - DAUDoS, to reduce bias with
minimal computational cost. We curate a gender annotated dataset and evaluate
all methods on VisoGender benchmark to quantify improvements and identify
dominant source of bias. Our results show that CDA reduces the gender gap by 6%
and DAUDoS by 3% but using only one-third of the data. Both methods also
improve the model's ability to correctly identify gender in images by 3%, with
DAUDoS achieving this improvement using only almost one-third of training data.
From our experiment's, we observed that CLIP's vision encoder is more biased
whereas PaliGemma2's text encoder is more biased. By identifying whether bias
stems more from vision or text encoders, our work enables more targeted and
effective bias mitigation strategies in future multi-modal systems.

Motivation: 传统方法假设训练数据无异常，但实际数据可能被污染，导致模型将异常误认为正常，降低检测性能。

Result: 在Real-IAD基准测试中表现出优异的异常检测和定位性能，且对噪声具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该框架模型无关，适用于多种无监督骨干网络，为实际场景中不完美训练数据提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of fully unsupervised image anomaly
detection (FUIAD), where training data may contain unlabeled anomalies.
Conventional methods assume anomaly-free training data, but real-world
contamination leads models to absorb anomalies as normal, degrading detection
performance. To mitigate this, we propose a two-stage framework that
systematically exploits inherent learning bias in models. The learning bias
stems from: (1) the statistical dominance of normal samples, driving models to
prioritize learning stable normal patterns over sparse anomalies, and (2)
feature-space divergence, where normal data exhibit high intra-class
consistency while anomalies display high diversity, leading to unstable model
responses. Leveraging the learning bias, stage 1 partitions the training set
into subsets, trains sub-models, and aggregates cross-model anomaly scores to
filter a purified dataset. Stage 2 trains the final detector on this dataset.
Experiments on the Real-IAD benchmark demonstrate superior anomaly detection
and localization performance under different noise conditions. Ablation studies
further validate the framework's contamination resilience, emphasizing the
critical role of learning bias exploitation. The model-agnostic design ensures
compatibility with diverse unsupervised backbones, offering a practical
solution for real-world scenarios with imperfect training data. Code is

*Siminfar Samakoush Galougah,Rishie Raj,Sanjoy Chowdhury,Sayan Nag,Ramani Duraiswami*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AURA是一个新的音频-视觉基准测试，旨在评估跨模态推理能力，避免单模态捷径，并提出AuraScore评估推理保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试仅关注最终答案准确性，无法区分真实理解与错误推理或幻觉导致的正确答案。

Method: AURA包含六个认知领域的问题，设计为无法通过单模态回答，并提出AuraScore评估推理的保真度。

Result: SOTA模型在AURA上显示高准确率但推理保真度低（低于45%），表明模型常通过错误逻辑得出正确答案。

Conclusion: AURA揭示了现有模型的推理缺陷，为更稳健的多模态评估提供了方向。

Abstract: Current audio-visual (AV) benchmarks focus on final answer accuracy,
overlooking the underlying reasoning process. This makes it difficult to
distinguish genuine comprehension from correct answers derived through flawed
reasoning or hallucinations. To address this, we introduce AURA (Audio-visual
Understanding and Reasoning Assessment), a benchmark for evaluating the
cross-modal reasoning capabilities of Audio-Visual Large Language Models
(AV-LLMs) and Omni-modal Language Models (OLMs). AURA includes questions across
six challenging cognitive domains, such as causality, timbre and pitch, tempo
and AV synchronization, unanswerability, implicit distractions, and skill
profiling, explicitly designed to be unanswerable from a single modality. This
forces models to construct a valid logical path grounded in both audio and
video, setting AURA apart from AV datasets that allow uni-modal shortcuts. To
assess reasoning traces, we propose a novel metric, AuraScore, which addresses
the lack of robust tools for evaluating reasoning fidelity. It decomposes
reasoning into two aspects: (i) Factual Consistency - whether reasoning is
grounded in perceptual evidence, and (ii) Core Inference - the logical validity
of each reasoning step. Evaluations of SOTA models on AURA reveal a critical
reasoning gap: although models achieve high accuracy (up to 92% on some tasks),
their Factual Consistency and Core Inference scores fall below 45%. This
discrepancy highlights that models often arrive at correct answers through
flawed logic, underscoring the need for our benchmark and paving the way for
more robust multimodal evaluation.

Abstract: In this paper, I present a comprehensive study comparing Photogrammetry and
Gaussian Splatting techniques for 3D model reconstruction and view synthesis. I
created a dataset of images from a real-world scene and constructed 3D models
using both methods. To evaluate the performance, I compared the models using
structural similarity index (SSIM), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), learned
perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS), and lp/mm resolution based on the
USAF resolution chart. A significant contribution of this work is the
development of a modified Gaussian Splatting repository, which I forked and
enhanced to enable rendering images from novel camera poses generated in the
Blender environment. This innovation allows for the synthesis of high-quality
novel views, showcasing the flexibility and potential of Gaussian Splatting. My
investigation extends to an augmented dataset that includes both original
ground images and novel views synthesized via Gaussian Splatting. This
augmented dataset was employed to generate a new photogrammetry model, which
was then compared against the original photogrammetry model created using only
the original images. The results demonstrate the efficacy of using Gaussian
Splatting to generate novel high-quality views and its potential to improve
photogrammetry-based 3D reconstructions. The comparative analysis highlights
the strengths and limitations of both approaches, providing valuable
information for applications in extended reality (XR), photogrammetry, and
autonomous vehicle simulations. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisR-Bench是一个多语言基准测试，用于长文档中的多模态检索，覆盖16种语言和多种问题类型，旨在填补现有基准测试的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要关注英文文档检索或单页图像的多语言问答，无法满足多语言长文档多模态检索的需求。

Method: 引入VisR-Bench，包含35K QA对和1.2K文档，支持细粒度多模态检索评估，涵盖多种语言和问题类型。

Result: 评估显示，MLLMs优于文本和多模态编码器模型，但在结构化表格和低资源语言上仍有挑战。

Conclusion: VisR-Bench为多语言视觉检索提供了新基准，揭示了当前模型的局限性，尤其是对复杂内容和低资源语言的处理。

Abstract: Most organizational data in this world are stored as documents, and visual
retrieval plays a crucial role in unlocking the collective intelligence from
all these documents. However, existing benchmarks focus on English-only
document retrieval or only consider multilingual question-answering on a
single-page image. To bridge this gap, we introduce VisR-Bench, a multilingual
benchmark designed for question-driven multimodal retrieval in long documents.
Our benchmark comprises over 35K high-quality QA pairs across 1.2K documents,
enabling fine-grained evaluation of multimodal retrieval. VisR-Bench spans
sixteen languages with three question types (figures, text, and tables),
offering diverse linguistic and question coverage. Unlike prior datasets, we
include queries without explicit answers, preventing models from relying on
superficial keyword matching. We evaluate various retrieval models, including
text-based methods, multimodal encoders, and MLLMs, providing insights into
their strengths and limitations. Our results show that while MLLMs
significantly outperform text-based and multimodal encoder models, they still
struggle with structured tables and low-resource languages, highlighting key
challenges in multilingual visual retrieval.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种改进的分割模型，结合自监督视觉模型和植物分类学层次推理，显著提升了除草剂研究中物种和损害识别的自动化效率与一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统手动视觉评估耗时、费力且主观，自动化识别因视觉差异细微而具挑战性，但能极大提升效率和一致性。

Method: 结合通用自监督视觉模型与植物分类学层次推理，利用2018-2020年德、西数据训练，测试于2023年数码相机及2024年无人机图像，评估跨域鲁棒性。

Result: 模型显著提升物种识别（F1分数0.52至0.85）和损害分类（F1分数0.28至0.44），在跨域（无人机图像）中表现稳健。

Conclusion: 模型具备强鲁棒性和实际应用价值，已部署于BASF表型分析流程，支持大规模自动化作物与杂草监测。

Abstract: Field trials are vital in herbicide research and development to assess
effects on crops and weeds under varied conditions. Traditionally, evaluations
rely on manual visual assessments, which are time-consuming, labor-intensive,
and subjective. Automating species and damage identification is challenging due
to subtle visual differences, but it can greatly enhance efficiency and
consistency.
  We present an improved segmentation model combining a general-purpose
self-supervised visual model with hierarchical inference based on botanical
taxonomy. Trained on a multi-year dataset (2018-2020) from Germany and Spain
using digital and mobile cameras, the model was tested on digital camera data
(year 2023) and drone imagery from the United States, Germany, and Spain (year
2024) to evaluate robustness under domain shift. This cross-device evaluation
marks a key step in assessing generalization across platforms of the model.
  Our model significantly improved species identification (F1-score: 0.52 to
0.85, R-squared: 0.75 to 0.98) and damage classification (F1-score: 0.28 to
0.44, R-squared: 0.71 to 0.87) over prior methods. Under domain shift (drone
images), it maintained strong performance with moderate degradation (species:
F1-score 0.60, R-squared 0.80; damage: F1-score 0.41, R-squared 0.62), where
earlier models failed.
  These results confirm the model's robustness and real-world applicability. It
is now deployed in BASF's phenotyping pipeline, enabling large-scale, automated
crop and weed monitoring across diverse geographies.

*Joonghyuk Shin,Alchan Hwang,Yujin Kim,Daneul Kim,Jaesik Park*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文分析了基于Transformer的多模态扩散模型（MM-DiT）的注意力机制，提出了一种新的基于提示的图像编辑方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统U-Net架构被Transformer取代后，MM-DiT的双向注意力机制对现有编辑技术提出了挑战，需要深入研究其行为模式。

Method: 通过将注意力矩阵分解为四个块，分析其特性，并提出一种支持全局到局部编辑的提示方法。

Result: 提出了一种适用于MM-DiT变体的鲁棒图像编辑方法，包括少步模型。

Conclusion: 研究填补了U-Net与新兴架构之间的差距，为MM-DiT的行为模式提供了更深入的理解。

Abstract: Transformer-based diffusion models have recently superseded traditional U-Net
architectures, with multimodal diffusion transformers (MM-DiT) emerging as the
dominant approach in state-of-the-art models like Stable Diffusion 3 and
Flux.1. Previous approaches have relied on unidirectional cross-attention
mechanisms, with information flowing from text embeddings to image latents. In
contrast, MMDiT introduces a unified attention mechanism that concatenates
input projections from both modalities and performs a single full attention
operation, allowing bidirectional information flow between text and image
branches. This architectural shift presents significant challenges for existing
editing techniques. In this paper, we systematically analyze MM-DiT's attention
mechanism by decomposing attention matrices into four distinct blocks,
revealing their inherent characteristics. Through these analyses, we propose a
robust, prompt-based image editing method for MM-DiT that supports global to
local edits across various MM-DiT variants, including few-step models. We
believe our findings bridge the gap between existing U-Net-based methods and
emerging architectures, offering deeper insights into MMDiT's behavioral
patterns.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合拒绝模块的top-rank学习方法，用于处理医学图像中的噪声标签和类别模糊实例，提高诊断准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像诊断中，噪声标签和类别模糊实例会干扰top-rank学习的目标，影响诊断的可靠性。

Method: 通过集成一个与top-rank损失协同优化的拒绝模块，识别并减少异常值的影响。

Result: 在医学数据集上的实验验证了该方法能有效检测和减少异常值，提升诊断可靠性。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提高了医学图像诊断的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: In medical image processing, accurate diagnosis is of paramount importance.
Leveraging machine learning techniques, particularly top-rank learning, shows
significant promise by focusing on the most crucial instances. However,
challenges arise from noisy labels and class-ambiguous instances, which can
severely hinder the top-rank objective, as they may be erroneously placed among
the top-ranked instances. To address these, we propose a novel approach that
enhances toprank learning by integrating a rejection module. Cooptimized with
the top-rank loss, this module identifies and mitigates the impact of outliers
that hinder training effectiveness. The rejection module functions as an
additional branch, assessing instances based on a rejection function that
measures their deviation from the norm. Through experimental validation on a
medical dataset, our methodology demonstrates its efficacy in detecting and
mitigating outliers, improving the reliability and accuracy of medical image
diagnoses.

*Xiaoming Li,Wangmeng Zuo,Chen Change Loy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对中文文本图像超分辨率（SR）的框架，通过引入结构先验和StyleGAN模型，实现了对低分辨率中文字符的精确恢复。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注英文文本，对更复杂的中文脚本关注较少。本文旨在解决低分辨率中文字符的精确恢复问题。

Method: 提出了一种结构先验，结合StyleGAN模型，通过代码本机制限制生成空间，生成高分辨率结构先验。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能有效恢复低分辨率中文字符的清晰笔画，适用于不规则布局的真实场景。

Conclusion: 该框架通过结构先验和StyleGAN的协同作用，显著提升了中文文本图像的超分辨率效果。

Abstract: Faithful text image super-resolution (SR) is challenging because each
character has a unique structure and usually exhibits diverse font styles and
layouts. While existing methods primarily focus on English text, less attention
has been paid to more complex scripts like Chinese. In this paper, we introduce
a high-quality text image SR framework designed to restore the precise strokes
of low-resolution (LR) Chinese characters. Unlike methods that rely on
character recognition priors to regularize the SR task, we propose a novel
structure prior that offers structure-level guidance to enhance visual quality.
Our framework incorporates this structure prior within a StyleGAN model,
leveraging its generative capabilities for restoration. To maintain the
integrity of character structures while accommodating various font styles and
layouts, we implement a codebook-based mechanism that restricts the generative
space of StyleGAN. Each code in the codebook represents the structure of a
specific character, while the vector $w$ in StyleGAN controls the character's
style, including typeface, orientation, and location. Through the collaborative
interaction between the codebook and style, we generate a high-resolution
structure prior that aligns with LR characters both spatially and structurally.
Experiments demonstrate that this structure prior provides robust,
character-specific guidance, enabling the accurate restoration of clear strokes
in degraded characters, even for real-world LR Chinese text with irregular
layouts. Our code and pre-trained models will be available at

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了医学图像去标识化的重要性，介绍了MIDI-B挑战赛及其结果，并分析了当前方法的局限性和未来改进方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 保护患者隐私同时确保医学数据的可用性，满足HIPAA等法规要求。

Method: 采用像素掩码、日期偏移、文本识别与替换等方法处理DICOM图像。

Result: 算法在MIDI-B挑战赛中正确执行99.92%的任务，排名第二。

Conclusion: 当前方法仍需改进，未来需探索更高效的去标识化技术。

Abstract: Image de-identification is essential for the public sharing of medical
images, particularly in the widely used Digital Imaging and Communications in
Medicine (DICOM) format as required by various regulations and standards,
including Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) privacy
rules, the DICOM PS3.15 standard, and best practices recommended by the Cancer
Imaging Archive (TCIA). The Medical Image De-Identification Benchmark (MIDI-B)
Challenge at the 27th International Conference on Medical Image Computing and
Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI 2024) was organized to evaluate
rule-based DICOM image de-identification algorithms with a large dataset of
clinical DICOM images. In this report, we explore the critical challenges of
de-identifying DICOM images, emphasize the importance of removing personally
identifiable information (PII) to protect patient privacy while ensuring the
continued utility of medical data for research, diagnostics, and treatment, and
provide a comprehensive overview of the standards and regulations that govern
this process. Additionally, we detail the de-identification methods we applied
- such as pixel masking, date shifting, date hashing, text recognition, text
replacement, and text removal - to process datasets during the test phase in
strict compliance with these standards. According to the final leaderboard of
the MIDI-B challenge, the latest version of our solution algorithm correctly
executed 99.92% of the required actions and ranked 2nd out of 10 teams that
completed the challenge (from a total of 22 registered teams). Finally, we
conducted a thorough analysis of the resulting statistics and discussed the
limitations of current approaches and potential avenues for future improvement.

Motivation: 传统方法依赖多医院数据，但数据收集困难。本文聚焦WSI内部域偏移（如患者特征和组织厚度），提出更实用的解决方案。

Method: 1. 聚类非肿瘤区域的WSI级特征作为域；2. 采用两阶段对比学习（WSI级和patch级）减少域间特征差异。

Result: 通过对比学习有效减少域间特征差异，提升模型泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法为病理图像域偏移问题提供了一种实用且有效的解决方案，尤其适用于数据收集受限的场景。

Abstract: In this paper, we address domain shifts in pathological images by focusing on
shifts within whole slide images~(WSIs), such as patient characteristics and
tissue thickness, rather than shifts between hospitals. Traditional approaches
rely on multi-hospital data, but data collection challenges often make this
impractical. Therefore, the proposed domain generalization method captures and
leverages intra-hospital domain shifts by clustering WSI-level features from
non-tumor regions and treating these clusters as domains. To mitigate domain
shift, we apply contrastive learning to reduce feature gaps between WSI pairs
from different clusters. The proposed method introduces a two-stage contrastive
learning approach WSI-level and patch-level contrastive learning to minimize
these gaps effectively.

Motivation: 现有文本到姿态生成模型依赖低层次详细提示，而人类倾向于用抽象语言描述动作，导致实际应用中的挑战。

Method: 引入CoT推理框架，将抽象提示转化为准确3D姿态，并提出自动生成训练数据三元组（抽象提示、详细提示、对应姿态）的流程。

Result: 实验表明，CoT-Pose能从抽象文本生成语义对齐的合理姿态。

Conclusion: 研究强调了高层次理解在姿态生成中的重要性，为推理增强方法开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) and
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning have led to significant progress in image and
text generation tasks. However, the field of 3D human pose generation still
faces critical limitations. Most existing text-to-pose models rely heavily on
detailed (low-level) prompts that explicitly describe joint configurations. In
contrast, humans tend to communicate actions and intentions using abstract
(high-level) language. This mismatch results in a practical challenge for
deploying pose generation systems in real-world scenarios. To bridge this gap,
we introduce a novel framework that incorporates CoT reasoning into the pose
generation process, enabling the interpretation of abstract prompts into
accurate 3D human poses. We further propose a data synthesis pipeline that
automatically generates triplets of abstract prompts, detailed prompts, and
corresponding 3D poses for training process. Experimental results demonstrate
that our reasoning-enhanced model, CoT-Pose, can effectively generate plausible
and semantically aligned poses from abstract textual inputs. This work
highlights the importance of high-level understanding in pose generation and
opens new directions for reasoning-enhanced approach for human pose generation.

Motivation: 解决现有足球评论生成系统中视频内容与评论细粒度对齐不足的问题。

Method: 扩展MatchVoice模型，使用GOAL数据集进行实验，测试不同训练配置和窗口大小对性能的影响。

Result: MatchVoice表现出良好的泛化能力，但仍需结合更广泛的视频-语言技术以进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: 研究为足球评论生成提供了改进方向，强调了跨领域技术整合的重要性。

Abstract: Automated soccer commentary generation has evolved from template-based
systems to advanced neural architectures, aiming to produce real-time
descriptions of sports events. While frameworks like SoccerNet-Caption laid
foundational work, their inability to achieve fine-grained alignment between
video content and commentary remains a significant challenge. Recent efforts
such as MatchTime, with its MatchVoice model, address this issue through coarse
and fine-grained alignment techniques, achieving improved temporal
synchronization. In this paper, we extend MatchVoice to commentary generation
for soccer highlights using the GOAL dataset, which emphasizes short clips over
entire games. We conduct extensive experiments to reproduce the original
MatchTime results and evaluate our setup, highlighting the impact of different
training configurations and hardware limitations. Furthermore, we explore the
effect of varying window sizes on zero-shot performance. While MatchVoice
exhibits promising generalization capabilities, our findings suggest the need
for integrating techniques from broader video-language domains to further
enhance performance. Our code is available at

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel pseudo-labeling method for medical image
segmentation that can perform learning on ``individual images'' to select
effective pseudo-labels. We introduce Positive and Unlabeled Learning (PU
learning), which uses only positive and unlabeled data for binary
classification problems, to obtain the appropriate metric for discriminating
foreground and background regions on each unlabeled image. Our PU learning
makes us easy to select pseudo-labels for various background regions. The
experimental results show the effectiveness of our method.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于特征图收敛分数（FMCS）的独立评估方法，用于提升自动驾驶感知和规划中端到端模型的透明度和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 端到端模型的中间功能模块缺乏显式监督信号，导致机制不透明且可解释性有限，传统方法难以独立评估和训练这些模块。

Method: 构建了双粒度动态加权评分系统（DG-DWSS），提出统一量化指标（特征图质量分数），并开发了基于CLIP的特征图质量评估网络（CLIP-FMQE-Net）。

Result: 在NuScenes数据集上实验表明，该方法提升了3D目标检测性能，NDS指标提高了3.89%。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了特征表示质量和整体模型性能。

Abstract: End-to-end models are emerging as the mainstream in autonomous driving
perception and planning. However, the lack of explicit supervision signals for
intermediate functional modules leads to opaque operational mechanisms and
limited interpretability, making it challenging for traditional methods to
independently evaluate and train these modules. Pioneering in the issue, this
study builds upon the feature map-truth representation similarity-based
evaluation framework and proposes an independent evaluation method based on
Feature Map Convergence Score (FMCS). A Dual-Granularity Dynamic Weighted
Scoring System (DG-DWSS) is constructed, formulating a unified quantitative
metric - Feature Map Quality Score - to enable comprehensive evaluation of the
quality of feature maps generated by functional modules. A CLIP-based Feature
Map Quality Evaluation Network (CLIP-FMQE-Net) is further developed, combining
feature-truth encoders and quality score prediction heads to enable real-time
quality analysis of feature maps generated by functional modules. Experimental
results on the NuScenes dataset demonstrate that integrating our evaluation
module into the training improves 3D object detection performance, achieving a
3.89 percent gain in NDS. These results verify the effectiveness of our method
in enhancing feature representation quality and overall model performance.

guidance effectively. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Splat4D, a
novel framework enabling high-fidelity 4D content generation from a monocular
video. Splat4D achieves superior performance while maintaining faithful
spatial-temporal coherence by leveraging multi-view rendering, inconsistency
identification, a video diffusion model, and an asymmetric U-Net for
refinement. Through extensive evaluations on public benchmarks, Splat4D
consistently demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across various metrics,
underscoring the efficacy of our approach. Additionally, the versatility of
Splat4D is validated in various applications such as text/image conditioned 4D

Motivation: 解决视觉语言模型在分布变化下性能下降及缓存方法中不可靠置信度和刚性决策边界的问题。

Method: 提出ACE框架，动态存储高置信度或低熵图像嵌入，并使用动态阈值和指数移动平均优化。

Result: 在15个基准数据集上表现优异，优于现有TTA方法。

Conclusion: ACE在分布变化场景中展现出更强的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit remarkable zero-shot generalization but
suffer performance degradation under distribution shifts in downstream tasks,
particularly in the absence of labeled data. Test-Time Adaptation (TTA)
addresses this challenge by enabling online optimization of VLMs during
inference, eliminating the need for annotated data. Cache-based TTA methods
exploit historical knowledge by maintaining a dynamic memory cache of
low-entropy or high-confidence samples, promoting efficient adaptation to
out-of-distribution data. Nevertheless, these methods face two critical
challenges: (1) unreliable confidence metrics under significant distribution
shifts, resulting in error accumulation within the cache and degraded
adaptation performance; and (2) rigid decision boundaries that fail to
accommodate substantial distributional variations, leading to suboptimal
predictions. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Adaptive Cache
Enhancement (ACE) framework, which constructs a robust cache by selectively
storing high-confidence or low-entropy image embeddings per class, guided by
dynamic, class-specific thresholds initialized from zero-shot statistics and
iteratively refined using an exponential moving average and
exploration-augmented updates. This approach enables adaptive, class-wise
decision boundaries, ensuring robust and accurate predictions across diverse
visual distributions. Extensive experiments on 15 diverse benchmark datasets
demonstrate that ACE achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering superior
robustness and generalization compared to existing TTA methods in challenging
out-of-distribution scenarios.

TL;DR: 论文研究了Vision Transformers（ViTs）中LayerNorm在数据稀缺和领域转移下的微调动态，提出了Fine-tuning Shift Ratio（FSR）和一种简单的重缩放机制，通过实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LayerNorm在ViTs中至关重要，但其在数据稀缺和领域转移下的微调动态尚未充分研究。

Method: 提出了FSR量化目标域样本的代表性，并设计了一个基于FSR的标量λ的重缩放机制，结合循环框架优化LayerNorm微调。

Result: 实验表明，OOD任务通常FSR较低且λ较高，病理数据微调更接近ID设置。

Conclusion: 揭示了LayerNorm在迁移学习中的动态特性，并提供了实用的微调策略。

Abstract: LayerNorm is pivotal in Vision Transformers (ViTs), yet its fine-tuning
dynamics under data scarcity and domain shifts remain underexplored. This paper
shows that shifts in LayerNorm parameters after fine-tuning (LayerNorm shifts)
are indicative of the transitions between source and target domains; its
efficacy is contingent upon the degree to which the target training samples
accurately represent the target domain, as quantified by our proposed
Fine-tuning Shift Ratio ($FSR$). Building on this, we propose a simple yet
effective rescaling mechanism using a scalar $\lambda$ that is negatively
correlated to $FSR$ to align learned LayerNorm shifts with those ideal shifts
achieved under fully representative data, combined with a cyclic framework that
further enhances the LayerNorm fine-tuning. Extensive experiments across
natural and pathological images, in both in-distribution (ID) and
out-of-distribution (OOD) settings, and various target training sample regimes
validate our framework. Notably, OOD tasks tend to yield lower $FSR$ and higher
$\lambda$ in comparison to ID cases, especially with scarce data, indicating
under-represented target training samples. Moreover, ViTFs fine-tuned on
pathological data behave more like ID settings, favoring conservative LayerNorm
updates. Our findings illuminate the underexplored dynamics of LayerNorm in
transfer learning and provide practical strategies for LayerNorm fine-tuning.

Motivation: 现有SOD模型依赖重型骨干网络，计算成本高，限制了在边缘设备等实际场景中的应用。

Method: 采用粒度感知范式，设计多尺度解码器，结合粒度金字塔卷积（GPC）和跨尺度注意力（CSA）模块，高效融合特征。

Result: 在轻量级图像和视频SOD模型中达到最新最优性能。

Conclusion: GAPNet通过优化特征利用和语义解释，显著降低了计算成本，同时保持了高性能。

Abstract: Recent salient object detection (SOD) models predominantly rely on
heavyweight backbones, incurring substantial computational cost and hindering
their practical application in various real-world settings, particularly on
edge devices. This paper presents GAPNet, a lightweight network built on the
granularity-aware paradigm for both image and video SOD. We assign saliency
maps of different granularities to supervise the multi-scale decoder
side-outputs: coarse object locations for high-level outputs and fine-grained
object boundaries for low-level outputs. Specifically, our decoder is built
with granularity-aware connections which fuse high-level features of low
granularity and low-level features of high granularity, respectively. To
support these connections, we design granular pyramid convolution (GPC) and
cross-scale attention (CSA) modules for efficient fusion of low-scale and
high-scale features, respectively. On top of the encoder, a self-attention
module is built to learn global information, enabling accurate object
localization with negligible computational cost. Unlike traditional U-Net-based
approaches, our proposed method optimizes feature utilization and semantic
interpretation while applying appropriate supervision at each processing stage.
Extensive experiments show that the proposed method achieves a new
state-of-the-art performance among lightweight image and video SOD models. Code

Abstract: Voice disorders significantly affect communication and quality of life,
requiring an early and accurate diagnosis. Traditional methods like
laryngoscopy are invasive, subjective, and often inaccessible. This research
proposes a noninvasive, machine learning-based framework for detecting voice
pathologies using phonation data.
  Phonation data from the Saarbr\"ucken Voice Database are analyzed using
acoustic features such as Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), chroma
features, and Mel spectrograms. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), including
LSTM and attention mechanisms, classify samples into normal and pathological
categories. Data augmentation techniques, including pitch shifting and Gaussian
noise addition, enhance model generalizability, while preprocessing ensures
signal quality. Scale-based features, such as H\"older and Hurst exponents,
further capture signal irregularities and long-term dependencies.
  The proposed framework offers a noninvasive, automated diagnostic tool for
early detection of voice pathologies, supporting AI-driven healthcare, and
improving patient outcomes.

Motivation: 深度伪造技术对数字完整性构成严重威胁，现有检测系统缺乏透明度和解释性，限制了其在实际决策中的使用。

Method: DF-P2E包含三个模块：基于Grad-CAM的深度伪造分类器、视觉描述模块和叙事优化模块，结合LLM生成用户友好的解释。

Result: 在DF40数据集上，系统实现了竞争性检测性能，并提供高质量的解释。

Conclusion: 该框架为可解释的深度伪造检测提供了可扩展的方法，推动了透明AI系统的发展。

Abstract: The proliferation of deepfake technologies poses urgent challenges and
serious risks to digital integrity, particularly within critical sectors such
as forensics, journalism, and the legal system. While existing detection
systems have made significant progress in classification accuracy, they
typically function as black-box models, offering limited transparency and
minimal support for human reasoning. This lack of interpretability hinders
their usability in real-world decision-making contexts, especially for
non-expert users. In this paper, we present DF-P2E (Deepfake: Prediction to
Explanation), a novel multimodal framework that integrates visual, semantic,
and narrative layers of explanation to make deepfake detection interpretable
and accessible. The framework consists of three modular components: (1) a
deepfake classifier with Grad-CAM-based saliency visualisation, (2) a visual
captioning module that generates natural language summaries of manipulated
regions, and (3) a narrative refinement module that uses a fine-tuned Large
Language Model (LLM) to produce context-aware, user-sensitive explanations. We
instantiate and evaluate the framework on the DF40 benchmark, the most diverse
deepfake dataset to date. Experiments demonstrate that our system achieves
competitive detection performance while providing high-quality explanations
aligned with Grad-CAM activations. By unifying prediction and explanation in a
coherent, human-aligned pipeline, this work offers a scalable approach to
interpretable deepfake detection, advancing the broader vision of trustworthy
and transparent AI systems in adversarial media environments.

Conclusion: ShoulderShot为实用对话视频生成提供了新可能性。

Abstract: Over-the-shoulder dialogue videos are essential in films, short dramas, and
advertisements, providing visual variety and enhancing viewers' emotional
connection. Despite their importance, such dialogue scenes remain largely
underexplored in video generation research. The main challenges include
maintaining character consistency across different shots, creating a sense of
spatial continuity, and generating long, multi-turn dialogues within limited
computational budgets. Here, we present ShoulderShot, a framework that combines
dual-shot generation with looping video, enabling extended dialogues while
preserving character consistency. Our results demonstrate capabilities that
surpass existing methods in terms of shot-reverse-shot layout, spatial
continuity, and flexibility in dialogue length, thereby opening up new
possibilities for practical dialogue video generation. Videos and comparisons

Abstract: In this paper, we present LaVieID, a novel \underline{l}ocal
\underline{a}utoregressive \underline{vi}d\underline{e}o diffusion framework
designed to tackle the challenging \underline{id}entity-preserving
text-to-video task. The key idea of LaVieID is to mitigate the loss of identity
information inherent in the stochastic global generation process of diffusion
transformers (DiTs) from both spatial and temporal perspectives. Specifically,
unlike the global and unstructured modeling of facial latent states in existing
DiTs, LaVieID introduces a local router to explicitly represent latent states
by weighted combinations of fine-grained local facial structures. This
alleviates undesirable feature interference and encourages DiTs to capture
distinctive facial characteristics. Furthermore, a temporal autoregressive
module is integrated into LaVieID to refine denoised latent tokens before video
decoding. This module divides latent tokens temporally into chunks, exploiting
their long-range temporal dependencies to predict biases for rectifying tokens,
thereby significantly enhancing inter-frame identity consistency. Consequently,
LaVieID can generate high-fidelity personalized videos and achieve
state-of-the-art performance. Our code and models are available at

Abstract: Existing open-source datasets for arbitrary-instruction image editing remain
suboptimal, while a plug-and-play editing module compatible with
community-prevalent generative models is notably absent. In this paper, we
first introduce the X2Edit Dataset, a comprehensive dataset covering 14 diverse
editing tasks, including subject-driven generation. We utilize the
industry-leading unified image generation models and expert models to construct
the data. Meanwhile, we design reasonable editing instructions with the VLM and
implement various scoring mechanisms to filter the data. As a result, we
construct 3.7 million high-quality data with balanced categories. Second, to
better integrate seamlessly with community image generation models, we design
task-aware MoE-LoRA training based on FLUX.1, with only 8\% of the parameters
of the full model. To further improve the final performance, we utilize the
internal representations of the diffusion model and define positive/negative
samples based on image editing types to introduce contrastive learning.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the model's editing performance is
competitive among many excellent models. Additionally, the constructed dataset
exhibits substantial advantages over existing open-source datasets. The

TL;DR: 提出了一种两阶段方法，通过隐式神经表示（INR）生成先验图像并校正投影数据，以减少牙科CBCT中的截断伪影。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小型探测器导致视野截断，影响迭代重建图像质量，需要解决截断伪影问题。

Method: 第一阶段使用INR生成先验图像并估计截断误差；第二阶段用校正后的数据进行常规迭代重建。

Result: 数值结果表明，该方法有效抑制截断伪影，提升图像质量。

Conclusion: 两阶段方法通过INR和迭代重建结合，显著改善了牙科CBCT的图像质量。

Abstract: In dental cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT), compact and cost-effective
system designs often use small detectors, resulting in a truncated field of
view (FOV) that does not fully encompass the patient's head. In iterative
reconstruction approaches, the discrepancy between the actual projection and
the forward projection within the truncated FOV accumulates over iterations,
leading to significant degradation in the reconstructed image quality. In this
study, we propose a two-stage approach to mitigate truncation artifacts in
dental CBCT. In the first stage, we employ Implicit Neural Representation
(INR), leveraging its superior representation power, to generate a prior image
over an extended region so that its forward projection fully covers the
patient's head. To reduce computational and memory burdens, INR reconstruction
is performed with a coarse voxel size. The forward projection of this prior
image is then used to estimate the discrepancy due to truncated FOV in the
measured projection data. In the second stage, the discrepancy-corrected
projection data is utilized in a conventional iterative reconstruction process
within the truncated region. Our numerical results demonstrate that the
proposed two-grid approach effectively suppresses truncation artifacts, leading
to improved CBCT image quality.

Result: SOFA能准确合成消融后图像，优化方案使模型预测的复发风险降低22.18%。

Conclusion: SOFA是首个整合手术效果模拟、复发预测和参数优化的框架，为个性化消融提供了新工具。

Abstract: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a prevalent cardiac arrhythmia often treated with
catheter ablation procedures, but procedural outcomes are highly variable.
Evaluating and improving ablation efficacy is challenging due to the complex
interaction between patient-specific tissue and procedural factors. This paper
asks two questions: Can AF recurrence be predicted by simulating the effects of
procedural parameters? How should we ablate to reduce AF recurrence? We propose
SOFA (Simulating and Optimizing Atrial Fibrillation Ablation), a novel
deep-learning framework that addresses these questions. SOFA first simulates
the outcome of an ablation strategy by generating a post-ablation image
depicting scar formation, conditioned on a patient's pre-ablation LGE-MRI and
the specific procedural parameters used (e.g., ablation locations, duration,
temperature, power, and force). During this simulation, it predicts AF
recurrence risk. Critically, SOFA then introduces an optimization scheme that
refines these procedural parameters to minimize the predicted risk. Our method
leverages a multi-modal, multi-view generator that processes 2.5D
representations of the atrium. Quantitative evaluations show that SOFA
accurately synthesizes post-ablation images and that our optimization scheme
leads to a 22.18\% reduction in the model-predicted recurrence risk. To the
best of our knowledge, SOFA is the first framework to integrate the simulation
of procedural effects, recurrence prediction, and parameter optimization,
offering a novel tool for personalizing AF ablation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在静态环境中，物体的空间布局通常一致，但现有检测模型未能充分利用这一先验，导致检测不一致或错误。

Method: 使用图神经网络（GNN）建模物体间的空间关系，通过邻域上下文纠正异常检测结果。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了检测性能，mAP@50最高提升4%。

Conclusion: 利用环境的空间结构可以有效提升物体检测系统的可靠性。

Abstract: In many real-world applications involving static environments, the spatial
layout of objects remains consistent across instances. However,
state-of-the-art object detection models often fail to leverage this spatial
prior, resulting in inconsistent predictions, missed detections, or
misclassifications, particularly in cluttered or occluded scenes. In this work,
we propose a graph-based post-processing pipeline that explicitly models the
spatial relationships between objects to correct detection anomalies in
egocentric frames. Using a graph neural network (GNN) trained on manually
annotated data, our model identifies invalid object class labels and predicts
corrected class labels based on their neighbourhood context. We evaluate our
approach both as a standalone anomaly detection and correction framework and as
a post-processing module for standard object detectors such as YOLOv7 and
RT-DETR. Experiments demonstrate that incorporating this spatial reasoning
significantly improves detection performance, with mAP@50 gains of up to 4%.
This method highlights the potential of leveraging the environment's spatial
structure to improve reliability in object detection systems.

Conclusion: TER通过置信度模块提升了模型的可靠性和鲁棒性，实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Existing emotion recognition methods mainly focus on enhancing performance by
employing complex deep models, typically resulting in significantly higher
model complexity. Although effective, it is also crucial to ensure the
reliability of the final decision, especially for noisy, corrupted and
out-of-distribution data. To this end, we propose a novel emotion recognition
method called trusted emotion recognition (TER), which utilizes uncertainty
estimation to calculate the confidence value of predictions. TER combines the
results from multiple modalities based on their confidence values to output the
trusted predictions. We also provide a new evaluation criterion to assess the
reliability of predictions. Specifically, we incorporate trusted precision and
trusted recall to determine the trusted threshold and formulate the trusted
Acc. and trusted F1 score to evaluate the model's trusted performance. The
proposed framework combines the confidence module that accordingly endows the
model with reliability and robustness against possible noise or corruption. The
extensive experimental results validate the effectiveness of our proposed
model. The TER achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Music-video,
achieving 82.40% Acc. In terms of trusted performance, TER outperforms other
methods on the IEMOCAP and Music-video, achieving trusted F1 scores of 0.7511

Motivation: 现有方法依赖提示或布局控制遮挡，但缺乏精确性。

Method: 利用预训练扩散模型和体积渲染原理，在潜在空间渲染场景，基于遮挡关系和物体透射率。

Result: 在遮挡准确性上显著优于现有方法，并能调整透明度、密度等效果。

Conclusion: 该方法无需重新训练，基于物理原理实现精确遮挡控制，扩展性强。

Abstract: We propose a novel training-free image generation algorithm that precisely
controls the occlusion relationships between objects in an image. Existing
image generation methods typically rely on prompts to influence occlusion,
which often lack precision. While layout-to-image methods provide control over
object locations, they fail to address occlusion relationships explicitly.
Given a pre-trained image diffusion model, our method leverages volume
rendering principles to "render" the scene in latent space, guided by occlusion
relationships and the estimated transmittance of objects. This approach does
not require retraining or fine-tuning the image diffusion model, yet it enables
accurate occlusion control due to its physics-grounded foundation. In extensive
experiments, our method significantly outperforms existing approaches in terms
of occlusion accuracy. Furthermore, we demonstrate that by adjusting the
opacities of objects or concepts during rendering, our method can achieve a
variety of effects, such as altering the transparency of objects, the density
of mass (e.g., forests), the concentration of particles (e.g., rain, fog), the
intensity of light, and the strength of lens effects, etc.

Motivation: 由于SAR数据标注需要专业知识，噪声标签不可避免，导致性能下降，现有方法主要针对图像数据，SAR的非直观特性使其难以实现噪声鲁棒学习。

Result: 在MSTAR数据集上实验表明，该方法在不同噪声条件下均能达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: CLSDF方法有效解决了SAR ATR中的噪声标签问题，提升了识别性能。

Abstract: The acquisition of high-quality labeled synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data
is challenging due to the demanding requirement for expert knowledge.
Consequently, the presence of unreliable noisy labels is unavoidable, which
results in performance degradation of SAR automatic target recognition (ATR).
Existing research on learning with noisy labels mainly focuses on image data.
However, the non-intuitive visual characteristics of SAR data are insufficient
to achieve noise-robust learning. To address this problem, we propose
collaborative learning of scattering and deep features (CLSDF) for SAR ATR with
noisy labels. Specifically, a multi-model feature fusion framework is designed
to integrate scattering and deep features. The attributed scattering centers
(ASCs) are treated as dynamic graph structure data, and the extracted physical
characteristics effectively enrich the representation of deep image features.
Then, the samples with clean and noisy labels are divided by modeling the loss
distribution with multiple class-wise Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs).
Afterward, the semi-supervised learning of two divergent branches is conducted
based on the data divided by each other. Moreover, a joint distribution
alignment strategy is introduced to enhance the reliability of co-guessed
labels. Extensive experiments have been done on the Moving and Stationary
Target Acquisition and Recognition (MSTAR) dataset, and the results show that
the proposed method can achieve state-of-the-art performance under different
operating conditions with various label noises.

Result: 实验表明UR-VTON在细节保留和图像质量上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: UR-VTON为长袖转短袖虚拟试衣提供了高效解决方案，并提出了新基准LS-TON。

Abstract: Virtual try-on (VTON) is a crucial task for enhancing user experience in
online shopping by generating realistic garment previews on personal photos.
Although existing methods have achieved impressive results, they struggle with
long-sleeve-to-short-sleeve conversions-a common and practical scenario-often
producing unrealistic outputs when exposed skin is underrepresented in the
original image. We argue that this challenge arises from the ''majority''
completion rule in current VTON models, which leads to inaccurate skin
restoration in such cases. To address this, we propose UR-VTON (Undress-Redress
Virtual Try-ON), a novel, training-free framework that can be seamlessly
integrated with any existing VTON method. UR-VTON introduces an
''undress-to-redress'' mechanism: it first reveals the user's torso by
virtually ''undressing,'' then applies the target short-sleeve garment,
effectively decomposing the conversion into two more manageable steps.
Additionally, we incorporate Dynamic Classifier-Free Guidance scheduling to
balance diversity and image quality during DDPM sampling, and employ Structural
Refiner to enhance detail fidelity using high-frequency cues. Finally, we
present LS-TON, a new benchmark for long-sleeve-to-short-sleeve try-on.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that UR-VTON outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in both detail preservation and image quality. Code will be released
upon acceptance.

TL;DR: 论文提出TAR-TVG框架，通过时间戳锚点约束推理过程，提升视频片段定位的准确性，并采用三阶段训练策略优化模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法未能显式约束推理过程，影响时间预测质量，需改进。

Result: 实验表明模型达到最先进性能，生成可解释、可验证的推理链，时间估计逐步细化。

Conclusion: TAR-TVG框架通过显式监督和渐进优化，显著提升了时间视频定位的准确性和可解释性。

Abstract: Temporal Video Grounding (TVG) aims to precisely localize video segments
corresponding to natural language queries, which is a critical capability for
long-form video understanding. Although existing reinforcement learning
approaches encourage models to generate reasoning chains before predictions,
they fail to explicitly constrain the reasoning process to ensure the quality
of the final temporal predictions. To address this limitation, we propose
Timestamp Anchor-constrained Reasoning for Temporal Video Grounding (TAR-TVG),
a novel framework that introduces timestamp anchors within the reasoning
process to enforce explicit supervision to the thought content. These anchors
serve as intermediate verification points. More importantly, we require each
reasoning step to produce increasingly accurate temporal estimations, thereby
ensuring that the reasoning process contributes meaningfully to the final
prediction. To address the challenge of low-probability anchor generation in
models (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL-3B), we develop an efficient self-distillation
training strategy: (1) initial GRPO training to collect 30K high-quality
reasoning traces containing multiple timestamp anchors, (2) supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) on distilled data, and (3) final GRPO optimization on the
SFT-enhanced model. This three-stage training strategy enables robust anchor
generation while maintaining reasoning quality. Experiments show that our model
achieves state-of-the-art performance while producing interpretable, verifiable
reasoning chains with progressively refined temporal estimations.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需调优、即插即用的方案，用于在单次推理中保持编辑后的3D内容与原始几何对齐，提升多视角一致性和网格质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着3D生成技术的发展，用户对个性化内容的需求增加，但现有编辑工具多为2D领域，直接应用于3D生成会导致信息丢失和质量下降。

Method: 提出几何保留模块，通过原始输入的法线潜在变量指导编辑后的多视角生成，并设计注入切换器控制原始法线的监督程度。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多种多视角扩散模型和编辑方法的组合下，显著提升了编辑后3D资产的多视角一致性和网格质量。

Conclusion: 该方法为3D内容编辑提供了一种高效且质量保障的解决方案。

Abstract: As 3D generation techniques continue to flourish, the demand for generating
personalized content is rapidly rising. Users increasingly seek to apply
various editing methods to polish generated 3D content, aiming to enhance its
color, style, and lighting without compromising the underlying geometry.
However, most existing editing tools focus on the 2D domain, and directly
feeding their results into 3D generation methods (like multi-view diffusion
models) will introduce information loss, degrading the quality of the final 3D
assets. In this paper, we propose a tuning-free, plug-and-play scheme that
aligns edited assets with their original geometry in a single inference run.
Central to our approach is a geometry preservation module that guides the
edited multi-view generation with original input normal latents. Besides, an
injection switcher is proposed to deliberately control the supervision extent
of the original normals, ensuring the alignment between the edited color and
normal views. Extensive experiments show that our method consistently improves
both the multi-view consistency and mesh quality of edited 3D assets, across
multiple combinations of multi-view diffusion models and editing methods.

Abstract: Accurate detection and classification of diverse door types in floor plans
drawings is critical for multiple applications, such as building compliance
checking, and indoor scene understanding. Despite their importance, publicly
available datasets specifically designed for fine-grained multi-class door
detection remain scarce. In this work, we present a semi-automated pipeline
that leverages a state-of-the-art object detector and a large language model
(LLM) to construct a multi-class door detection dataset with minimal manual
effort. Doors are first detected as a unified category using a deep object
detection model. Next, an LLM classifies each detected instance based on its
visual and contextual features. Finally, a human-in-the-loop stage ensures
high-quality labels and bounding boxes. Our method significantly reduces
annotation cost while producing a dataset suitable for benchmarking neural
models in floor plan analysis. This work demonstrates the potential of
combining deep learning and multimodal reasoning for efficient dataset
construction in complex real-world domains.

Abstract: Image segmentation plays a crucial role in extracting objects of interest and
identifying their boundaries within an image. However, accurate segmentation
becomes challenging when dealing with occlusions, obscurities, or noise in
corrupted images. To tackle this challenge, prior information is often
utilized, with recent attention on star-shape priors. In this paper, we propose
a star-shape segmentation model based on the registration framework. By
combining the level set representation with the registration framework and
imposing constraints on the deformed level set function, our model enables both
full and partial star-shape segmentation, accommodating single or multiple
centers. Additionally, our approach allows for the enforcement of identified
boundaries to pass through specified landmark locations. We tackle the proposed
models using the alternating direction method of multipliers. Through numerical
experiments conducted on synthetic and real images, we demonstrate the efficacy
of our approach in achieving accurate star-shape segmentation.

TL;DR: 论文提出TriReWeight方法，通过三重连接样本重加权提升生成数据增强效果，理论分析和实验验证其优于现有方法。

Motivation: 解决生成数据增强中因不可控生成过程和自然语言模糊性导致的噪声图像问题。

Method: 提出TriReWeight方法，基于三重连接的样本重加权，理论分析三种生成图像监督方式。

Result: 在六个自然图像数据集上平均提升7.9%，三个医学数据集上平均提升3.4%。

Conclusion: TriReWeight方法通用性强，可与任何生成数据增强方法结合且不降低性能。

Abstract: The performance of computer vision models in certain real-world applications,
such as medical diagnosis, is often limited by the scarcity of available
images. Expanding datasets using pre-trained generative models is an effective
solution. However, due to the uncontrollable generation process and the
ambiguity of natural language, noisy images may be generated. Re-weighting is
an effective way to address this issue by assigning low weights to such noisy
images. We first theoretically analyze three types of supervision for the
generated images. Based on the theoretical analysis, we develop TriReWeight, a
triplet-connection-based sample re-weighting method to enhance generative data
augmentation. Theoretically, TriReWeight can be integrated with any generative
data augmentation methods and never downgrade their performance. Moreover, its
generalization approaches the optimal in the order $O(\sqrt{d\ln (n)/n})$. Our
experiments validate the correctness of the theoretical analysis and
demonstrate that our method outperforms the existing SOTA methods by $7.9\%$ on
average over six natural image datasets and by $3.4\%$ on average over three
medical datasets. We also experimentally validate that our method can enhance
the performance of different generative data augmentation methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的加速方法GSD，通过动态分组评估视觉有效令牌，显著提升自回归图像模型的推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归图像模型推理速度慢，传统推测解码方法无法充分利用图像令牌的冗余性和多样性。

Method: 提出Grouped Speculative Decoding（GSD），动态评估视觉有效令牌簇而非单个令牌，避免传统方法的假阴性拒绝。

Result: 实验表明GSD平均加速3.7倍，且不损失图像质量。

Conclusion: GSD是一种高效、无需训练的加速方法，适用于自回归图像模型。

Abstract: Recently, autoregressive (AR) image models have demonstrated remarkable
generative capabilities, positioning themselves as a compelling alternative to
diffusion models. However, their sequential nature leads to long inference
times, limiting their practical scalability. In this work, we introduce Grouped
Speculative Decoding (GSD), a novel, training-free acceleration method for AR
image models. While recent studies have explored Speculative Decoding (SD) as a
means to speed up AR image generation, existing approaches either provide only
modest acceleration or require additional training. Our in-depth analysis
reveals a fundamental difference between language and image tokens: image
tokens exhibit inherent redundancy and diversity, meaning multiple tokens can
convey valid semantics. However, traditional SD methods are designed to accept
only a single most-likely token, which fails to leverage this difference,
leading to excessive false-negative rejections. To address this, we propose a
new SD strategy that evaluates clusters of visually valid tokens rather than
relying on a single target token. Additionally, we observe that static
clustering based on embedding distance is ineffective, which motivates our
dynamic GSD approach. Extensive experiments show that GSD accelerates AR image
models by an average of 3.7x while preserving image quality-all without
requiring any additional training. The source code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需额外信息的对比学习方法（Contrastive Inversion），通过对比输入图像提取共同概念，并利用解耦交叉注意力微调提高生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖文本提示或空间掩码等额外指导，可能导致辅助特征分离不完全，影响生成质量。

Method: 通过对比学习训练目标标记和图像辅助文本标记，提取解耦的真实语义，并应用解耦交叉注意力微调。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在概念表示和编辑方面均优于现有技术，实现了平衡的高性能。

Conclusion: Contrastive Inversion 是一种高效的方法，无需额外信息即可提取共同概念，并显著提升生成质量。

Abstract: The recent demand for customized image generation raises a need for
techniques that effectively extract the common concept from small sets of
images. Existing methods typically rely on additional guidance, such as text
prompts or spatial masks, to capture the common target concept. Unfortunately,
relying on manually provided guidance can lead to incomplete separation of
auxiliary features, which degrades generation quality.In this paper, we propose
Contrastive Inversion, a novel approach that identifies the common concept by
comparing the input images without relying on additional information. We train
the target token along with the image-wise auxiliary text tokens via
contrastive learning, which extracts the well-disentangled true semantics of
the target. Then we apply disentangled cross-attention fine-tuning to improve
concept fidelity without overfitting. Experimental results and analysis
demonstrate that our method achieves a balanced, high-level performance in both
concept representation and editing, outperforming existing techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有参考分割方法依赖元学习，需要大量数据和计算成本，而CAV-SAM旨在以更轻量的方式适应下游任务。

Method: 通过伪视频视角表示图像对，结合DBST模块（扩散模型构建语义变换序列）和TTGA模块（测试时几何对齐），利用SAM2的iVOS能力。

Result: 在广泛使用的数据集上，分割性能提升超过5%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CAV-SAM为视觉模型轻量级适配提供了一种高效的新方向。

Abstract: Large vision models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM) exhibit significant
limitations when applied to downstream tasks in the wild. Consequently,
reference segmentation, which leverages reference images and their
corresponding masks to impart novel knowledge to the model, emerges as a
promising new direction for adapting vision models. However, existing reference
segmentation approaches predominantly rely on meta-learning, which still
necessitates an extensive meta-training process and brings massive data and
computational cost. In this study, we propose a novel approach by representing
the inherent correspondence between reference-target image pairs as a pseudo
video. This perspective allows the latest version of SAM, known as SAM2, which
is equipped with interactive video object segmentation (iVOS) capabilities, to
be adapted to downstream tasks in a lightweight manner. We term this approach
Correspondence As Video for SAM (CAV-SAM). CAV-SAM comprises two key modules:
the Diffusion-Based Semantic Transition (DBST) module employs a diffusion model
to construct a semantic transformation sequence, while the Test-Time Geometric
Alignment (TTGA) module aligns the geometric changes within this sequence
through test-time fine-tuning. We evaluated CAVSAM on widely-used datasets,
achieving segmentation performance improvements exceeding 5% over SOTA methods.
Implementation is provided in the supplementary materials.

Result: UniSVG显著提升开源MLLMs在SVG任务中的表现，超越GPT-4V等闭源模型。

Conclusion: UniSVG为SVG理解与生成提供了首个综合性数据集，推动了MLLMs在该领域的应用。

Abstract: Unlike bitmap images, scalable vector graphics (SVG) maintain quality when
scaled, frequently employed in computer vision and artistic design in the
representation of SVG code. In this era of proliferating AI-powered systems,
enabling AI to understand and generate SVG has become increasingly urgent.
However, AI-driven SVG understanding and generation (U&G) remain significant
challenges. SVG code, equivalent to a set of curves and lines controlled by
floating-point parameters, demands high precision in SVG U&G. Besides, SVG
generation operates under diverse conditional constraints, including textual
prompts and visual references, which requires powerful multi-modal processing
for condition-to-SVG transformation. Recently, the rapid growth of Multi-modal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated capabilities to process
multi-modal inputs and generate complex vector controlling parameters,
suggesting the potential to address SVG U&G tasks within a unified model. To
unlock MLLM's capabilities in the SVG area, we propose an SVG-centric dataset
called UniSVG, comprising 525k data items, tailored for MLLM training and
evaluation. To our best knowledge, it is the first comprehensive dataset
designed for unified SVG generation (from textual prompts and images) and SVG
understanding (color, category, usage, etc.). As expected, learning on the
proposed dataset boosts open-source MLLMs' performance on various SVG U&G
tasks, surpassing SOTA close-source MLLMs like GPT-4V. We release dataset,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在复杂场景动态中难以保持视角一致性，尤其是在多元素交互的大规模环境中。

Method: 采用两阶段架构：先通过少样本学习预测相机轨迹，再通过姿态条件扩散过程生成几何一致的多视角序列，最终转换为持久4D表示。

Result: 框架首次结合了视频扩散模型的时间先验和重建模型的几何感知，生成质量（如mPSNR、mSSIM）优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Dream4D通过协同两种模型，显著推动了4D内容生成的发展。

Abstract: The synthesis of spatiotemporally coherent 4D content presents fundamental
challenges in computer vision, requiring simultaneous modeling of high-fidelity
spatial representations and physically plausible temporal dynamics. Current
approaches often struggle to maintain view consistency while handling complex
scene dynamics, particularly in large-scale environments with multiple
interacting elements. This work introduces Dream4D, a novel framework that
bridges this gap through a synergy of controllable video generation and neural
4D reconstruction. Our approach seamlessly combines a two-stage architecture:
it first predicts optimal camera trajectories from a single image using
few-shot learning, then generates geometrically consistent multi-view sequences
via a specialized pose-conditioned diffusion process, which are finally
converted into a persistent 4D representation. This framework is the first to
leverage both rich temporal priors from video diffusion models and geometric
awareness of the reconstruction models, which significantly facilitates 4D
generation and shows higher quality (e.g., mPSNR, mSSIM) over existing methods.

<details>

Motivation: 现有零样本学习中的语义原型是手动定义的，可能引入噪声监督，导致视觉-语义映射不准确。

Method: 提出CLZSL框架，包含PCL模块（优先学习高相似样本）和PUP模块（动态更新语义原型）。

Result: 在AWA2、SUN和CUB数据集上验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: CLZSL通过减少噪声监督，显著提升了零样本学习的性能。

Abstract: In Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL), embedding-based methods enable knowledge
transfer from seen to unseen classes by learning a visual-semantic mapping from
seen-class images to class-level semantic prototypes (e.g., attributes).
However, these semantic prototypes are manually defined and may introduce noisy
supervision for two main reasons: (i) instance-level mismatch: variations in
perspective, occlusion, and annotation bias will cause discrepancies between
individual sample and the class-level semantic prototypes; and (ii) class-level
imprecision: the manually defined semantic prototypes may not accurately
reflect the true semantics of the class. Consequently, the visual-semantic
mapping will be misled, reducing the effectiveness of knowledge transfer to
unseen classes. In this work, we propose a prototype-guided curriculum learning
framework (dubbed as CLZSL), which mitigates instance-level mismatches through
a Prototype-Guided Curriculum Learning (PCL) module and addresses class-level
imprecision via a Prototype Update (PUP) module. Specifically, the PCL module
prioritizes samples with high cosine similarity between their visual mappings
and the class-level semantic prototypes, and progressively advances to
less-aligned samples, thereby reducing the interference of instance-level
mismatches to achieve accurate visual-semantic mapping. Besides, the PUP module
dynamically updates the class-level semantic prototypes by leveraging the
visual mappings learned from instances, thereby reducing class-level
imprecision and further improving the visual-semantic mapping. Experiments were
conducted on standard benchmark datasets-AWA2, SUN, and CUB-to verify the
effectiveness of our method.

Conclusion: 该方法无需能量守恒假设，适用于复杂系统，且易于集成到现有流程中。

Abstract: Modeling the rotation of moving objects is a fundamental task in computer
vision, yet $SO(3)$ extrapolation still presents numerous challenges: (1)
unknown quantities such as the moment of inertia complicate dynamics, (2) the
presence of external forces and torques can lead to non-conservative
kinematics, and (3) estimating evolving state trajectories under sparse, noisy
observations requires robustness. We propose modeling trajectories of noisy
pose estimates on the manifold of 3D rotations in a physically and
geometrically meaningful way by leveraging Neural Controlled Differential
Equations guided with $SO(3)$ Savitzky-Golay paths. Existing extrapolation
methods often rely on energy conservation or constant velocity assumptions,
limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios involving non-conservative
forces. In contrast, our approach is agnostic to energy and momentum
conservation while being robust to input noise, making it applicable to
complex, non-inertial systems. Our approach is easily integrated as a module in
existing pipelines and generalizes well to trajectories with unknown physical
parameters. By learning to approximate object dynamics from noisy states during
training, our model attains robust extrapolation capabilities in simulation and
various real-world settings. Code is available at

Conclusion: 片段化方法显著提升了步态识别性能，展示了多尺度时间上下文的潜力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in gait recognition have significantly enhanced
performance by treating silhouettes as either an unordered set or an ordered
sequence. However, both set-based and sequence-based approaches exhibit notable
limitations. Specifically, set-based methods tend to overlook short-range
temporal context for individual frames, while sequence-based methods struggle
to capture long-range temporal dependencies effectively. To address these
challenges, we draw inspiration from human identification and propose a new
perspective that conceptualizes human gait as a composition of individualized
actions. Each action is represented by a series of frames, randomly selected
from a continuous segment of the sequence, which we term a snippet.
Fundamentally, the collection of snippets for a given sequence enables the
incorporation of multi-scale temporal context, facilitating more comprehensive
gait feature learning. Moreover, we introduce a non-trivial solution for
snippet-based gait recognition, focusing on Snippet Sampling and Snippet
Modeling as key components. Extensive experiments on four widely-used gait
datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed approach and, more
importantly, highlight the potential of gait snippets. For instance, our method
achieves the rank-1 accuracy of 77.5% on Gait3D and 81.7% on GREW using a 2D
convolution-based backbone.

Conclusion: TSDF通过双功能对抗扰动实现了对深度伪造攻击的持久防御，解决了现有防御策略的局限性。

Abstract: Active defense strategies have been developed to counter the threat of
deepfake technology. However, a primary challenge is their lack of persistence,
as their effectiveness is often short-lived. Attackers can bypass these
defenses by simply collecting protected samples and retraining their models.
This means that static defenses inevitably fail when attackers retrain their
models, which severely limits practical use. We argue that an effective defense
not only distorts forged content but also blocks the model's ability to adapt,
which occurs when attackers retrain their models on protected images. To
achieve this, we propose an innovative Two-Stage Defense Framework (TSDF).
Benefiting from the intensity separation mechanism designed in this paper, the
framework uses dual-function adversarial perturbations to perform two roles.
First, it can directly distort the forged results. Second, it acts as a
poisoning vehicle that disrupts the data preparation process essential for an
attacker's retraining pipeline. By poisoning the data source, TSDF aims to
prevent the attacker's model from adapting to the defensive perturbations, thus
ensuring the defense remains effective long-term. Comprehensive experiments
show that the performance of traditional interruption methods degrades sharply
when it is subjected to adversarial retraining. However, our framework shows a
strong dual defense capability, which can improve the persistence of active
defense. Our code will be available at https://github.com/vpsg-research/TSDF.

Abstract: Power batteries are essential components in electric vehicles, where internal
structural defects can pose serious safety risks. We conduct a comprehensive
study on a new task, power battery detection (PBD), which aims to localize the
dense endpoints of cathode and anode plates from industrial X-ray images for
quality inspection. Manual inspection is inefficient and error-prone, while
traditional vision algorithms struggle with densely packed plates, low
contrast, scale variation, and imaging artifacts. To address this issue and
drive more attention into this meaningful task, we present PBD5K, the first
large-scale benchmark for this task, consisting of 5,000 X-ray images from nine
battery types with fine-grained annotations and eight types of real-world
visual interference. To support scalable and consistent labeling, we develop an
intelligent annotation pipeline that combines image filtering, model-assisted
pre-labeling, cross-verification, and layered quality evaluation. We formulate
PBD as a point-level segmentation problem and propose MDCNeXt, a model designed
to extract and integrate multi-dimensional structure clues including point,
line, and count information from the plate itself. To improve discrimination
between plates and suppress visual interference, MDCNeXt incorporates two state
space modules. The first is a prompt-filtered module that learns contrastive
relationships guided by task-specific prompts. The second is a density-aware
reordering module that refines segmentation in regions with high plate density.
In addition, we propose a distance-adaptive mask generation strategy to provide
robust supervision under varying spatial distributions of anode and cathode
positions. The source code and datasets will be publicly available at

TL;DR: MambaTrans是一种新颖的多模态融合图像模态翻译器，旨在解决可见图像与多模态融合图像之间的像素分布差异问题，提升下游任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有下游预训练模型通常在可见图像上训练，而多模态融合图像与可见图像的像素分布差异会降低下游任务性能。

Method: 提出MambaTrans，利用多模态大语言模型的描述和语义分割模型的掩码作为输入，结合多模型状态空间块，增强纯视觉能力。

Result: 实验表明，MambaTrans在不调整预训练模型参数的情况下，有效提升了多模态图像在下游任务中的性能。

Conclusion: MambaTrans通过结合文本、掩码和图像的长期依赖关系，成功解决了多模态融合图像与预训练模型之间的适配问题。

Abstract: The goal of multimodal image fusion is to integrate complementary information
from infrared and visible images, generating multimodal fused images for
downstream tasks. Existing downstream pre-training models are typically trained
on visible images. However, the significant pixel distribution differences
between visible and multimodal fusion images can degrade downstream task
performance, sometimes even below that of using only visible images. This paper
explores adapting multimodal fused images with significant modality differences
to object detection and semantic segmentation models trained on visible images.
To address this, we propose MambaTrans, a novel multimodal fusion image
modality translator. MambaTrans uses descriptions from a multimodal large
language model and masks from semantic segmentation models as input. Its core
component, the Multi-Model State Space Block, combines mask-image-text
cross-attention and a 3D-Selective Scan Module, enhancing pure visual
capabilities. By leveraging object detection prior knowledge, MambaTrans
minimizes detection loss during training and captures long-term dependencies
among text, masks, and images. This enables favorable results in pre-trained
models without adjusting their parameters. Experiments on public datasets show
that MambaTrans effectively improves multimodal image performance in downstream
tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Pose-RFT提出了一种基于强化学习的微调框架，用于多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）中的3D人体姿态生成，通过混合动作强化学习优化离散语言预测和连续姿态生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于监督学习的MLLMs在3D姿态生成任务中难以建模模糊性和任务对齐，Pose-RFT旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用HyGRPO算法进行混合动作强化学习，结合任务特定奖励函数优化空间对齐和语义一致性。

Result: 在多个姿态生成基准上，Pose-RFT显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 混合动作强化微调在3D姿态生成中具有有效性。

Abstract: Generating 3D human poses from multimodal inputs such as images or text
requires models to capture both rich spatial and semantic correspondences.
While pose-specific multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown promise
in this task, they are typically trained with supervised objectives such as
SMPL parameter regression or token-level prediction, which struggle to model
the inherent ambiguity and achieve task-specific alignment required for
accurate 3D pose generation. To address these limitations, we propose Pose-RFT,
a reinforcement fine-tuning framework tailored for 3D human pose generation in
MLLMs. We formulate the task as a hybrid action reinforcement learning problem
that jointly optimizes discrete language prediction and continuous pose
generation. To this end, we introduce HyGRPO, a hybrid reinforcement learning
algorithm that performs group-wise reward normalization over sampled responses
to guide joint optimization of discrete and continuous actions. Pose-RFT
further incorporates task-specific reward functions to guide optimization
towards spatial alignment in image-to-pose generation and semantic consistency
in text-to-pose generation. Extensive experiments on multiple pose generation
benchmarks demonstrate that Pose-RFT significantly improves performance over
existing pose-specific MLLMs, validating the effectiveness of hybrid action
reinforcement fine-tuning for 3D pose generation.

TL;DR: DiTVR是一种零样本视频修复框架，结合扩散变换器和轨迹感知注意力，通过光流轨迹对齐令牌，提升时间一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统回归方法生成不真实细节且需大量配对数据，生成扩散模型难以保证时间一致性。

Method: 采用扩散变换器与轨迹感知注意力，结合光流轨迹对齐令牌，动态选择相关令牌，注入数据一致性到低频带。

Result: 在视频修复基准测试中达到零样本最优，时间一致性和细节保留表现优异。

Conclusion: DiTVR通过新方法解决了时间一致性问题，同时保持细节和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Video restoration aims to reconstruct high quality video sequences from low
quality inputs, addressing tasks such as super resolution, denoising, and
deblurring. Traditional regression based methods often produce unrealistic
details and require extensive paired datasets, while recent generative
diffusion models face challenges in ensuring temporal consistency. We introduce
DiTVR, a zero shot video restoration framework that couples a diffusion
transformer with trajectory aware attention and a wavelet guided, flow
consistent sampler. Unlike prior 3D convolutional or frame wise diffusion
approaches, our attention mechanism aligns tokens along optical flow
trajectories, with particular emphasis on vital layers that exhibit the highest
sensitivity to temporal dynamics. A spatiotemporal neighbour cache dynamically
selects relevant tokens based on motion correspondences across frames. The flow
guided sampler injects data consistency only into low-frequency bands,
preserving high frequency priors while accelerating convergence. DiTVR
establishes a new zero shot state of the art on video restoration benchmarks,
demonstrating superior temporal consistency and detail preservation while
remaining robust to flow noise and occlusions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAR和光学图像的互补性使其匹配备受关注，但现有方法依赖耗时复杂的人工标注，难以获取足够标注数据。

Method: 设计半监督匹配流程，利用伪标签生成相似性热图，结合跨模态特征增强模块，通过无监督目标分离模态共享和特定特征。

Result: S2M2-SAR在基准数据集上表现优于现有半监督方法，与全监督SOTA方法竞争。

Conclusion: S2M2-SAR高效实用，解决了标注数据不足的问题，展现了半监督方法的潜力。

Abstract: Driven by the complementary nature of optical and synthetic aperture radar
(SAR) images, SAR-optical image matching has garnered significant interest.
Most existing SAR-optical image matching methods aim to capture effective
matching features by employing the supervision of pixel-level matched
correspondences within SAR-optical image pairs, which, however, suffers from
time-consuming and complex manual annotation, making it difficult to collect
sufficient labeled SAR-optical image pairs. To handle this, we design a
semi-supervised SAR-optical image matching pipeline that leverages both scarce
labeled and abundant unlabeled image pairs and propose a semi-supervised
multiscale matching for SAR-optical image matching (S2M2-SAR). Specifically, we
pseudo-label those unlabeled SAR-optical image pairs with pseudo ground-truth
similarity heatmaps by combining both deep and shallow level matching results,
and train the matching model by employing labeled and pseudo-labeled similarity
heatmaps. In addition, we introduce a cross-modal feature enhancement module
trained using a cross-modality mutual independence loss, which requires no
ground-truth labels. This unsupervised objective promotes the separation of
modality-shared and modality-specific features by encouraging statistical
independence between them, enabling effective feature disentanglement across
optical and SAR modalities. To evaluate the effectiveness of S2M2-SAR, we
compare it with existing competitors on benchmark datasets. Experimental
results demonstrate that S2M2-SAR not only surpasses existing semi-supervised
methods but also achieves performance competitive with fully supervised SOTA
methods, demonstrating its efficiency and practical potential.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无参考图像质量评估方法对全局表征关注过多或对区域特征采用统一权重，导致对局部质量变化的敏感性不足。

Method: 利用Segment Anything Model动态分割图像，结合多模态大语言模型提取区域描述内容与感知多维度失真，并引入区域感知语义注意力机制。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上表现出色，具有竞争性的质量预测性能。

Conclusion: RSFIQA模型通过细粒度区域分析和注意力机制，显著提升了无参考图像质量评估的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: No-reference image quality assessment (NR-IQA) aims to simulate the process
of perceiving image quality aligned with subjective human perception. However,
existing NR-IQA methods either focus on global representations that leads to
limited insights into the semantically salient regions or employ a uniform
weighting for region features that weakens the sensitivity to local quality
variations. In this paper, we propose a fine-grained image quality assessment
model, named RSFIQA, which integrates region-level distortion information to
perceive multi-dimensional quality discrepancies. To enhance regional quality
awareness, we first utilize the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to dynamically
partition the input image into non-overlapping semantic regions. For each
region, we teach a powerful Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) to extract
descriptive content and perceive multi-dimensional distortions, enabling a
comprehensive understanding of both local semantics and quality degradations.
To effectively leverage this information, we introduce Region-Aware Semantic
Attention (RSA) mechanism, which generates a global attention map by
aggregating fine-grained representations from local regions. In addition,
RSFIQA is backbone-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into various deep
neural network architectures. Extensive experiments demonstrate the robustness
and effectiveness of the proposed method, which achieves competitive quality
prediction performance across multiple benchmark datasets.

Result: 在工业和医学基准测试中表现出卓越的准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 协同设计框架是适应基础模型到密集感知任务的关键。

Abstract: Pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) face a significant adaptation gap
when applied to Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection (ZSAD), stemming from their lack of
local inductive biases for dense prediction and their reliance on inflexible
feature fusion paradigms. We address these limitations through an Architectural
Co-Design framework that jointly refines feature representation and cross-modal
fusion. Our method integrates a parameter-efficient Convolutional Low-Rank
Adaptation (Conv-LoRA) adapter to inject local inductive biases for
fine-grained representation, and introduces a Dynamic Fusion Gateway (DFG) that
leverages visual context to adaptively modulate text prompts, enabling a
powerful bidirectional fusion. Extensive experiments on diverse industrial and
medical benchmarks demonstrate superior accuracy and robustness, validating
that this synergistic co-design is critical for robustly adapting foundation
models to dense perception tasks.

Conclusion: MIMIC是首个针对VLM视觉概念解释的反演方法。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) encode multimodal inputs over large, complex,
and difficult-to-interpret architectures, which limit transparency and trust.
We propose a Multimodal Inversion for Model Interpretation and
Conceptualization (MIMIC) framework to visualize the internal representations
of VLMs by synthesizing visual concepts corresponding to internal encodings.
MIMIC uses a joint VLM-based inversion and a feature alignment objective to
account for VLM's autoregressive processing. It additionally includes a triplet
of regularizers for spatial alignment, natural image smoothness, and semantic
realism. We quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate MIMIC by inverting visual
concepts over a range of varying-length free-form VLM output texts. Reported
results include both standard visual quality metrics as well as semantic
text-based metrics. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first model
inversion approach addressing visual interpretations of VLM concepts.

Method: 通过从现有数据库中提取领域和任务相关的图像-文本对，对VLM进行继续预训练。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了CONCH和QuiltNet在三个下游任务中的零样本和小样本性能，且在大规模训练时表现与少样本方法相当。

Conclusion: 无需标注的继续预训练是一种有效的、任务无关的VLM适应方法，适用于新的病理学任务。

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in histopathology, such as
CONCH and QuiltNet, have demonstrated impressive zero-shot classification
capabilities across various tasks. However, their general-purpose design may
lead to suboptimal performance in specific downstream applications. While
supervised fine-tuning methods address this issue, they require manually
labeled samples for adaptation. This paper investigates annotation-free
adaptation of VLMs through continued pretraining on domain- and task-relevant
image-caption pairs extracted from existing databases. Our experiments on two
VLMs, CONCH and QuiltNet, across three downstream tasks reveal that these pairs
substantially enhance both zero-shot and few-shot performance. Notably, with
larger training sizes, continued pretraining matches the performance of
few-shot methods while eliminating manual labeling. Its effectiveness,
task-agnostic design, and annotation-free workflow make it a promising pathway
for adapting VLMs to new histopathology tasks. Code is available at

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上，CBDES MoE在mAP和NDS指标上分别提升了1.6和4.1个百分点。

Conclusion: CBDES MoE在自动驾驶领域首次实现了模块级混合专家框架，验证了其有效性和实用性。

Abstract: Bird's Eye View (BEV) perception systems based on multi-sensor feature fusion
have become a fundamental cornerstone for end-to-end autonomous driving.
However, existing multi-modal BEV methods commonly suffer from limited input
adaptability, constrained modeling capacity, and suboptimal generalization. To
address these challenges, we propose a hierarchically decoupled
Mixture-of-Experts architecture at the functional module level, termed
Computing Brain DEvelopment System Mixture-of-Experts (CBDES MoE). CBDES MoE
integrates multiple structurally heterogeneous expert networks with a
lightweight Self-Attention Router (SAR) gating mechanism, enabling dynamic
expert path selection and sparse, input-aware efficient inference. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first modular Mixture-of-Experts framework
constructed at the functional module granularity within the autonomous driving
domain. Extensive evaluations on the real-world nuScenes dataset demonstrate
that CBDES MoE consistently outperforms fixed single-expert baselines in 3D
object detection. Compared to the strongest single-expert model, CBDES MoE
achieves a 1.6-point increase in mAP and a 4.1-point improvement in NDS,
demonstrating the effectiveness and practical advantages of the proposed
approach.

Conclusion: Deep SWM为太阳耀斑预测提供了高效可靠的解决方案，并开源了基准数据集。

Abstract: Accurate, reliable solar flare prediction is crucial for mitigating potential
disruptions to critical infrastructure, while predicting solar flares remains a
significant challenge. Existing methods based on heuristic physical features
often lack representation learning from solar images. On the other hand,
end-to-end learning approaches struggle to model long-range temporal
dependencies in solar images. In this study, we propose Deep Space Weather
Model (Deep SWM), which is based on multiple deep state space models for
handling both ten-channel solar images and long-range spatio-temporal
dependencies. Deep SWM also features a sparse masked autoencoder, a novel
pretraining strategy that employs a two-phase masking approach to preserve
crucial regions such as sunspots while compressing spatial information.
Furthermore, we built FlareBench, a new public benchmark for solar flare
prediction covering a full 11-year solar activity cycle, to validate our
method. Our method outperformed baseline methods and even human expert
performance on standard metrics in terms of performance and reliability. The

Abstract: Minimally invasive surgery presents challenges such as dynamic tissue motion
and a limited field of view. Accurate tissue tracking has the potential to
support surgical guidance, improve safety by helping avoid damage to sensitive

combines two CoTracker models, one for temporal tracking and one for stereo
matching, to estimate 3D motion from stereo endoscopic images. We evaluate the
system using a clinical laparoscopic setup and a robotic arm simulating tissue
motion, with experiments conducted on a synthetic 3D-printed phantom and a
chicken tissue phantom. Tracking on the chicken tissue phantom yielded more
reliable results, with Euclidean distance errors as low as 1.1 mm at a velocity
of 10 mm/s. These findings highlight the potential of TAP-based models for

Abstract: Human motion generation has emerged as a critical technology with
transformative potential for real-world applications. However, existing
vision-language-motion models (VLMMs) face significant limitations that hinder
their practical deployment. We identify controllability as a main bottleneck,
manifesting in five key aspects: inadequate response to diverse human commands,
limited pose initialization capabilities, poor performance on long-term
sequences, insufficient handling of unseen scenarios, and lack of fine-grained
control over individual body parts. To overcome these limitations, we present
Being-M0.5, the first real-time, controllable VLMM that achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple motion generation tasks. Our
approach is built upon HuMo100M, the largest and most comprehensive human
motion dataset to date, comprising over 5 million self-collected motion
sequences, 100 million multi-task instructional instances, and detailed
part-level annotations that address a critical gap in existing datasets. We
introduce a novel part-aware residual quantization technique for motion
tokenization that enables precise, granular control over individual body parts
during generation. Extensive experimental validation demonstrates Being-M0.5's
superior performance across diverse motion benchmarks, while comprehensive
efficiency analysis confirms its real-time capabilities. Our contributions
include design insights and detailed computational analysis to guide future
development of practical motion generators. We believe that HuMo100M and
Being-M0.5 represent significant advances that will accelerate the adoption of
motion generation technologies in real-world applications. The project page is

Motivation: 现有图像令牌剪枝方法仅适用于单图像任务，忽略多模态上下文学习中的更高冗余和效率需求，导致性能下降。

Method: 提出CATP，两阶段渐进剪枝方法，无需训练，充分处理跨模态交互。

Result: 剪除77.8%图像令牌后，性能平均提升0.6%，推理延迟降低10.78%。

Conclusion: CATP提升多模态上下文学习的实用价值，为未来图像-文本交织场景奠定基础。

Abstract: Modern large vision-language models (LVLMs) convert each input image into a
large set of tokens, far outnumbering the text tokens. Although this improves
visual perception, it introduces severe image token redundancy. Because image
tokens carry sparse information, many add little to reasoning, yet greatly
increase inference cost. The emerging image token pruning methods tackle this
issue by identifying the most important tokens and discarding the rest. These
methods can raise efficiency with only modest performance loss. However, most
of them only consider single-image tasks and overlook multimodal in-context
learning (ICL), where redundancy is greater and efficiency is more critical.
Redundant tokens weaken the advantage of multimodal ICL for rapid domain
adaptation and cause unstable performance. Applying existing pruning methods in
this setting leads to large accuracy drops, exposing a clear gap and the need
for new techniques. Thus, we propose Contextually Adaptive Token Pruning
(CATP), a training-free pruning method targeted at multimodal ICL. CATP
consists of two stages that perform progressive pruning to fully account for
the complex cross-modal interactions in the input sequence. After removing
77.8\% of the image tokens, CATP produces an average performance gain of 0.6\%
over the vanilla model on four LVLMs and eight benchmarks, exceeding all
baselines remarkably. Meanwhile, it effectively improves efficiency by
achieving an average reduction of 10.78\% in inference latency. CATP enhances
the practical value of multimodal ICL and lays the groundwork for future
progress in interleaved image-text scenarios.

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法能有效将激活从无关区域转移到有意义的功能线索上。

Conclusion: 该方法在弱监督功能接地任务中表现出色，代码已开源。

Abstract: Facilitating an entity's interaction with objects requires accurately
identifying parts that afford specific actions. Weakly supervised affordance
grounding (WSAG) seeks to imitate human learning from third-person
demonstrations, where humans intuitively grasp functional parts without needing
pixel-level annotations. To achieve this, grounding is typically learned using
a shared classifier across images from different perspectives, along with
distillation strategies incorporating part discovery process. However, since
affordance-relevant parts are not always easily distinguishable, models
primarily rely on classification, often focusing on common class-specific
patterns that are unrelated to affordance. To address this limitation, we move
beyond isolated part-level learning by introducing selective prototypical and
pixel contrastive objectives that adaptively learn affordance-relevant cues at
both the part and object levels, depending on the granularity of the available
information. Initially, we find the action-associated objects in both
egocentric (object-focused) and exocentric (third-person example) images by
leveraging CLIP. Then, by cross-referencing the discovered objects of
complementary views, we excavate the precise part-level affordance clues in
each perspective. By consistently learning to distinguish affordance-relevant
regions from affordance-irrelevant background context, our approach effectively
shifts activation from irrelevant areas toward meaningful affordance cues.
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Codes are

Abstract: Image restoration under adverse weather conditions has been extensively
explored, leading to numerous high-performance methods. In particular, recent
advances in All-in-One approaches have shown impressive results by training on
multi-task image restoration datasets. However, most of these methods rely on
dedicated network modules or parameters for each specific degradation type,
resulting in a significant parameter overhead. Moreover, the relatedness across
different restoration tasks is often overlooked. In light of these issues, we
propose a parameter-efficient All-in-One image restoration framework that
leverages task-aware enhanced prompts to tackle various adverse weather
degradations.Specifically, we adopt a two-stage training paradigm consisting of
a pretraining phase and a prompt-tuning phase to mitigate parameter conflicts
across tasks. We first employ supervised learning to acquire general
restoration knowledge, and then adapt the model to handle specific degradation
via trainable soft prompts. Crucially, we enhance these task-specific prompts
in a task-aware manner. We apply low-rank decomposition to these prompts to
capture both task-general and task-specific characteristics, and impose
contrastive constraints to better align them with the actual inter-task
relatedness. These enhanced prompts not only improve the parameter efficiency
of the restoration model but also enable more accurate task modeling, as
evidenced by t-SNE analysis. Experimental results on different restoration
tasks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance with
only 2.75M parameters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前数据驱动方法需要大量高质量标注数据，限制了手术数据科学的应用，因此需要解决数据稀缺问题。

Method: 提出动态高斯模型表示动态手术场景，结合动态训练调整策略和自动标注方法，生成合成数据。

Result: 实验显示，该方法生成的合成数据质量高（PSNR 29.87），且基于合成数据训练的模型性能优于传统数据增强方法10%。

Conclusion: 动态高斯泼溅技术能有效缓解数据稀缺问题，显著提升模型性能，为手术自动化提供支持。

Abstract: Computer vision-based technologies significantly enhance surgical automation
by advancing tool tracking, detection, and localization. However, Current
data-driven approaches are data-voracious, requiring large, high-quality
labeled image datasets, which limits their application in surgical data
science. Our Work introduces a novel dynamic Gaussian Splatting technique to
address the data scarcity in surgical image datasets. We propose a dynamic
Gaussian model to represent dynamic surgical scenes, enabling the rendering of
surgical instruments from unseen viewpoints and deformations with real tissue
backgrounds. We utilize a dynamic training adjustment strategy to address
challenges posed by poorly calibrated camera poses from real-world scenarios.
Additionally, we propose a method based on dynamic Gaussians for automatically
generating annotations for our synthetic data. For evaluation, we constructed a
new dataset featuring seven scenes with 14,000 frames of tool and camera motion
and tool jaw articulation, with a background of an ex-vivo porcine model. Using
this dataset, we synthetically replicate the scene deformation from the ground
truth data, allowing direct comparisons of synthetic image quality.
Experimental results illustrate that our method generates photo-realistic
labeled image datasets with the highest values in Peak-Signal-to-Noise Ratio
(29.87). We further evaluate the performance of medical-specific neural
networks trained on real and synthetic images using an unseen real-world image
dataset. Our results show that the performance of models trained on synthetic
images generated by the proposed method outperforms those trained with
state-of-the-art standard data augmentation by 10%, leading to an overall
improvement in model performances by nearly 15%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖过多训练参数且与其他AIGC工具兼容性差，需要一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: 在预训练视频生成模型中引入条件图像分支，通过受限自注意力与条件位置映射实现身份控制，仅需2000对数据进行快速学习。

Result: 仅增加约1%参数即可在视频质量和身份保持上优于全参数训练方法，并能无缝集成到其他任务中。

Conclusion: Stand-In框架高效且灵活，适用于多种视频生成任务。

Abstract: Generating high-fidelity human videos that match user-specified identities is
important yet challenging in the field of generative AI. Existing methods often
rely on an excessive number of training parameters and lack compatibility with
other AIGC tools. In this paper, we propose Stand-In, a lightweight and
plug-and-play framework for identity preservation in video generation.
Specifically, we introduce a conditional image branch into the pre-trained
video generation model. Identity control is achieved through restricted
self-attentions with conditional position mapping, and can be learned quickly
with only 2000 pairs. Despite incorporating and training just $\sim$1\%
additional parameters, our framework achieves excellent results in video
quality and identity preservation, outperforming other full-parameter training
methods. Moreover, our framework can be seamlessly integrated for other tasks,
such as subject-driven video generation, pose-referenced video generation,
stylization, and face swapping.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 历史文档手写文本识别因笔迹多样性、文档退化及布局标注有限而具有挑战性，标注错误（如连字符问题）进一步增加了难度。

Method: 采用基于CTC对齐算法的自训练方法，利用动态规划和模型输出概率匹配全文转录与文本行图像。

Result: 方法提高了性能（如CER提升1.1个百分点）和对齐准确性，发现较弱模型反而能提供更准确的对齐。

Conclusion: 该方法可迭代应用以进一步提升CER和对齐质量，同时发布了手动校正的Bullinger数据集子集和代码。

Abstract: Handwritten text recognition for historical documents remains challenging due
to handwriting variability, degraded sources, and limited layout-aware
annotations. In this work, we address annotation errors - particularly
hyphenation issues - in the Bullinger correspondence, a large 16th-century
letter collection. We introduce a self-training method based on a CTC alignment
algorithm that matches full transcriptions to text line images using dynamic
programming and model output probabilities trained with the CTC loss. Our
approach improves performance (e.g., by 1.1 percentage points CER with PyLaia)
and increases alignment accuracy. Interestingly, we find that weaker models
yield more accurate alignments, enabling an iterative training strategy. We
release a new manually corrected subset of 100 pages from the Bullinger
dataset, along with our code and benchmarks. Our approach can be applied
iteratively to further improve the CER as well as the alignment quality for
text recognition pipelines. Code and data are available via

Motivation: 现有视频抠图方法因缺乏高质量真实数据而泛化能力差，本文旨在通过合成数据和预训练模型解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了一种结合大规模合成数据预训练和视频扩散模型先验的新架构，强调时间一致性设计。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上表现优异，展示了强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法通过合成数据和预训练模型显著提升了视频抠图的性能，代码已开源。

Abstract: Video matting has traditionally been limited by the lack of high-quality
ground-truth data. Most existing video matting datasets provide only
human-annotated imperfect alpha and foreground annotations, which must be
composited to background images or videos during the training stage. Thus, the
generalization capability of previous methods in real-world scenarios is
typically poor. In this work, we propose to solve the problem from two
perspectives. First, we emphasize the importance of large-scale pre-training by
pursuing diverse synthetic and pseudo-labeled segmentation datasets. We also
develop a scalable synthetic data generation pipeline that can render diverse
human bodies and fine-grained hairs, yielding around 200 video clips with a
3-second duration for fine-tuning. Second, we introduce a novel video matting
approach that can effectively leverage the rich priors from pre-trained video
diffusion models. This architecture offers two key advantages. First, strong
priors play a critical role in bridging the domain gap between synthetic and
real-world scenes. Second, unlike most existing methods that process video
matting frame-by-frame and use an independent decoder to aggregate temporal
information, our model is inherently designed for video, ensuring strong
temporal consistency. We provide a comprehensive quantitative evaluation across
three benchmark datasets, demonstrating our approach's superior performance,
and present comprehensive qualitative results in diverse real-world scenes,
illustrating the strong generalization capability of our method. The code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在静态结构的长期稳定性和动态运动的高保真细节保留之间存在冲突，导致重建质量下降。

Method: 设计了双记忆架构：瞬态动态记忆（TDM）捕捉高频动态细节，持久结构记忆（PSM）保留长期静态信息。

Result: 在基准测试中表现优异，同时保持了高效性。

Conclusion: Mem4D通过解耦静态和动态建模，实现了高质量的重建效果。

Abstract: Reconstructing dense geometry for dynamic scenes from a monocular video is a
critical yet challenging task. Recent memory-based methods enable efficient
online reconstruction, but they fundamentally suffer from a Memory Demand
Dilemma: The memory representation faces an inherent conflict between the
long-term stability required for static structures and the rapid, high-fidelity
detail retention needed for dynamic motion. This conflict forces existing
methods into a compromise, leading to either geometric drift in static
structures or blurred, inaccurate reconstructions of dynamic objects. To
address this dilemma, we propose Mem4D, a novel framework that decouples the
modeling of static geometry and dynamic motion. Guided by this insight, we
design a dual-memory architecture: 1) The Transient Dynamics Memory (TDM)
focuses on capturing high-frequency motion details from recent frames, enabling
accurate and fine-grained modeling of dynamic content; 2) The Persistent
Structure Memory (PSM) compresses and preserves long-term spatial information,
ensuring global consistency and drift-free reconstruction for static elements.
By alternating queries to these specialized memories, Mem4D simultaneously
maintains static geometry with global consistency and reconstructs dynamic
elements with high fidelity. Experiments on challenging benchmarks demonstrate
that our method achieves state-of-the-art or competitive performance while
maintaining high efficiency. Codes will be publicly available.

Abstract: Visual Question Answering (VQA) in remote sensing (RS) is pivotal for
interpreting Earth observation data. However, existing RS VQA datasets are
constrained by limitations in annotation richness, question diversity, and the
assessment of specific reasoning capabilities. This paper introduces RSVLM-QA
dataset, a new large-scale, content-rich VQA dataset for the RS domain.
RSVLM-QA is constructed by integrating data from several prominent RS
segmentation and detection datasets: WHU, LoveDA, INRIA, and iSAID. We employ
an innovative dual-track annotation generation pipeline. Firstly, we leverage
Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4.1, with meticulously designed
prompts to automatically generate a suite of detailed annotations including
image captions, spatial relations, and semantic tags, alongside complex
caption-based VQA pairs. Secondly, to address the challenging task of object
counting in RS imagery, we have developed a specialized automated process that
extracts object counts directly from the original segmentation data; GPT-4.1
then formulates natural language answers from these counts, which are paired
with preset question templates to create counting QA pairs. RSVLM-QA comprises
13,820 images and 162,373 VQA pairs, featuring extensive annotations and
diverse question types. We provide a detailed statistical analysis of the
dataset and a comparison with existing RS VQA benchmarks, highlighting the
superior depth and breadth of RSVLM-QA's annotations. Furthermore, we conduct
benchmark experiments on Six mainstream Vision Language Models (VLMs),
demonstrating that RSVLM-QA effectively evaluates and challenges the
understanding and reasoning abilities of current VLMs in the RS domain. We
believe RSVLM-QA will serve as a pivotal resource for the RS VQA and VLM
research communities, poised to catalyze advancements in the field.

Abstract: Generative AI holds great potentials to automate and enhance data synthesis

Two applications are demonstrated: Pose2Xray, which generates synthetic X-rays
from photographic mouse images, and DosimetrEYE, which estimates 3D radiation
dose maps from 2D SPECT/CT scans. In both cases, our outlier detection (OD)
enhances reliability, reduces manual oversight, and supports real-time quality
control. This approach strengthens the industrial viability of GenAI in
preclinical settings by increasing robustness, scalability, and regulatory
compliance.

Result: 在Charades-STA和ActivityNet Captions数据集上取得最优结果，且不依赖LLMs。

Conclusion: TAG是一种简单有效的零样本视频时间定位方法，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) aims to extract relevant video segments based
on a given natural language query. Recently, zero-shot VTG methods have gained
attention by leveraging pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) to localize
target moments without additional training. However, existing approaches suffer
from semantic fragmentation, where temporally continuous frames sharing the
same semantics are split across multiple segments. When segments are
fragmented, it becomes difficult to predict an accurate target moment that
aligns with the text query. Also, they rely on skewed similarity distributions
for localization, making it difficult to select the optimal segment.
Furthermore, they heavily depend on the use of LLMs which require expensive
inferences. To address these limitations, we propose a \textit{TAG}, a simple
yet effective Temporal-Aware approach for zero-shot video temporal Grounding,
which incorporates temporal pooling, temporal coherence clustering, and
similarity adjustment. Our proposed method effectively captures the temporal
context of videos and addresses distorted similarity distributions without
training. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on Charades-STA and
ActivityNet Captions benchmark datasets without rely on LLMs. Our code is

Conclusion: VOIDFace为面部识别系统提供了一种隐私保护、高效且用户可控的解决方案。

Abstract: Advancement of machine learning techniques, combined with the availability of
large-scale datasets, has significantly improved the accuracy and efficiency of
facial recognition. Modern facial recognition systems are trained using large
face datasets collected from diverse individuals or public repositories.
However, for training, these datasets are often replicated and stored in
multiple workstations, resulting in data replication, which complicates
database management and oversight. Currently, once a user submits their face
for dataset preparation, they lose control over how their data is used, raising
significant privacy and ethical concerns. This paper introduces VOIDFace, a
novel framework for facial recognition systems that addresses two major issues.
First, it eliminates the need of data replication and improves data control to
securely store training face data by using visual secret sharing. Second, it
proposes a patch-based multi-training network that uses this novel training
data storage mechanism to develop a robust, privacy-preserving facial
recognition system. By integrating these advancements, VOIDFace aims to improve
the privacy, security, and efficiency of facial recognition training, while
ensuring greater control over sensitive personal face data. VOIDFace also
enables users to exercise their Right-To-Be-Forgotten property to control their
personal data. Experimental evaluations on the VGGFace2 dataset show that
VOIDFace provides Right-To-Be-Forgotten, improved data control, security, and
privacy while maintaining competitive facial recognition performance. Code is

Abstract: Providing intelligent support to surgical teams is a key frontier in
automated surgical scene understanding, with the long-term goal of improving
patient outcomes. Developing personalized intelligence for all staff members
requires maintaining a consistent state of who is located where for long
surgical procedures, which still poses numerous computational challenges. We
propose TrackOR, a framework for tackling long-term multi-person tracking and
re-identification in the operating room. TrackOR uses 3D geometric signatures
to achieve state-of-the-art online tracking performance (+11% Association
Accuracy over the strongest baseline), while also enabling an effective offline
recovery process to create analysis-ready trajectories. Our work shows that by
leveraging 3D geometric information, persistent identity tracking becomes
attainable, enabling a critical shift towards the more granular, staff-centric
analyses required for personalized intelligent systems in the operating room.
This new capability opens up various applications, including our proposed
temporal pathway imprints that translate raw tracking data into actionable
insights for improving team efficiency and safety and ultimately providing
personalized support.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频生成模型在视觉特效（VFX）生产中受限于单特效训练，无法实现空间可控的复合特效生成。

Method: 提出LoRA-MoE（基于LoRA的专家混合）和SAP（空间感知提示）技术，结合IIF模块实现多特效的独立控制。

Result: Omni-Effects实现了精确的空间控制和多样化的特效生成，用户可指定特效类别和位置。

Conclusion: 该框架为VFX生产提供了高效、可控的解决方案，推动了多特效联合生成的发展。

Abstract: Visual effects (VFX) are essential visual enhancements fundamental to modern
cinematic production. Although video generation models offer cost-efficient
solutions for VFX production, current methods are constrained by per-effect
LoRA training, which limits generation to single effects. This fundamental
limitation impedes applications that require spatially controllable composite
effects, i.e., the concurrent generation of multiple effects at designated
locations. However, integrating diverse effects into a unified framework faces
major challenges: interference from effect variations and spatial
uncontrollability during multi-VFX joint training. To tackle these challenges,
we propose Omni-Effects, a first unified framework capable of generating
prompt-guided effects and spatially controllable composite effects. The core of
our framework comprises two key innovations: (1) LoRA-based Mixture of Experts
(LoRA-MoE), which employs a group of expert LoRAs, integrating diverse effects
within a unified model while effectively mitigating cross-task interference.
(2) Spatial-Aware Prompt (SAP) incorporates spatial mask information into the
text token, enabling precise spatial control. Furthermore, we introduce an
Independent-Information Flow (IIF) module integrated within the SAP, isolating
the control signals corresponding to individual effects to prevent any unwanted
blending. To facilitate this research, we construct a comprehensive VFX dataset
Omni-VFX via a novel data collection pipeline combining image editing and
First-Last Frame-to-Video (FLF2V) synthesis, and introduce a dedicated VFX
evaluation framework for validating model performance. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Omni-Effects achieves precise spatial control and diverse
effect generation, enabling users to specify both the category and location of
desired effects.

Motivation: MLLMs作为辅助技术潜力巨大，但在实际应用中存在信任问题，尤其是对连续低信号运动的感知不足。

Method: 通过分析现有视频理解的帧采样范式，指出其将视频视为静态图像序列的局限性。

Result: 提出‘隐式运动盲区’概念，并强调其对用户信任的负面影响。

Conclusion: 呼吁从语义识别转向物理感知，开发以用户需求为中心的新基准，确保动态环境中的安全性和可靠性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold immense promise as assistive
technologies for the blind and visually impaired (BVI) community. However, we
identify a critical failure mode that undermines their trustworthiness in
real-world applications. We introduce the Escalator Problem -- the inability of
state-of-the-art models to perceive an escalator's direction of travel -- as a
canonical example of a deeper limitation we term Implicit Motion Blindness.
This blindness stems from the dominant frame-sampling paradigm in video
understanding, which, by treating videos as discrete sequences of static
images, fundamentally struggles to perceive continuous, low-signal motion. As a
position paper, our contribution is not a new model but rather to: (I) formally
articulate this blind spot, (II) analyze its implications for user trust, and
(III) issue a call to action. We advocate for a paradigm shift from purely
semantic recognition towards robust physical perception and urge the
development of new, human-centered benchmarks that prioritize safety,
reliability, and the genuine needs of users in dynamic environments.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为ProGraD的方法，通过可学习的群体提示和轻量级GroupContext Transformer，改进了基于Vision Foundation Models的群体活动检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Vision Foundation Models（如DinoV2）虽然在对象中心数据上表现优异，但在群体动态建模方面尚未充分探索，且直接替换CNN骨干网络效果有限。

Method: ProGraD方法包括：1）可学习的群体提示，引导VFM关注社交配置；2）轻量级GroupContext Transformer，推断参与者与群体的关联及集体行为。

Result: 在Cafe和Social-CAD两个基准测试中，ProGraD均优于现有方法，尤其在多群体复杂场景中表现突出（Group mAP@1.0提升6.5%，Group mAP@0.5提升8.2%）。

Conclusion: ProGraD不仅提升了性能，还生成了可解释的注意力图，为群体推理提供了新视角。代码和模型将公开。

Abstract: Group Activity Detection (GAD) involves recognizing social groups and their
collective behaviors in videos. Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), like DinoV2,
offer excellent features, but are pretrained primarily on object-centric data
and remain underexplored for modeling group dynamics. While they are a
promising alternative to highly task-specific GAD architectures that require
full fine-tuning, our initial investigation reveals that simply swapping CNN
backbones used in these methods with VFMs brings little gain, underscoring the
need for structured, group-aware reasoning on top.
  We introduce Prompt-driven Group Activity Detection (ProGraD) -- a method
that bridges this gap through 1) learnable group prompts to guide the VFM
attention toward social configurations, and 2) a lightweight two-layer
GroupContext Transformer that infers actor-group associations and collective
behavior. We evaluate our approach on two recent GAD benchmarks: Cafe, which
features multiple concurrent social groups, and Social-CAD, which focuses on
single-group interactions. While we surpass state-of-the-art in both settings,
our method is especially effective in complex multi-group scenarios, where we
yield a gain of 6.5\% (Group mAP\@1.0) and 8.2\% (Group mAP\@0.5) using only
10M trainable parameters. Furthermore, our experiments reveal that ProGraD
produces interpretable attention maps, offering insights into actor-group
reasoning. Code and models will be released.

Result: SRA在ImageNet上达到78.31%的Top-1准确率，并在下游任务中表现良好。

Conclusion: SRA为更简单、有效且实用的AutoDA设计提供了新方向。

Abstract: Automatic data augmentation (AutoDA) plays an important role in enhancing the
generalization of neural networks. However, mainstream AutoDA methods often
encounter two challenges: either the search process is excessively
time-consuming, hindering practical application, or the performance is
suboptimal due to insufficient policy adaptation during training. To address
these issues, we propose Sample-aware RandAugment (SRA), an asymmetric,
search-free AutoDA method that dynamically adjusts augmentation policies while
maintaining straightforward implementation. SRA incorporates a heuristic
scoring module that evaluates the complexity of the original training data,
enabling the application of tailored augmentations for each sample.
Additionally, an asymmetric augmentation strategy is employed to maximize the
potential of this scoring module. In multiple experimental settings, SRA
narrows the performance gap between search-based and search-free AutoDA
methods, achieving a state-of-the-art Top-1 accuracy of 78.31\% on ImageNet
with ResNet-50. Notably, SRA demonstrates good compatibility with existing
augmentation pipelines and solid generalization across new tasks, without
requiring hyperparameter tuning. The pretrained models leveraging SRA also
enhance recognition in downstream object detection tasks. SRA represents a
promising step towards simpler, more effective, and practical AutoDA designs
applicable to a variety of future tasks. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 论文探讨了深度学习模型在手术室环境中因学习虚假相关性而导致的偏差问题，提出通过3D点云序列编码人员信息来解决这一问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手术室中标准化服装掩盖了识别特征，导致模型依赖无关视觉线索（如鞋子、眼镜等），影响任务准确性。需开发更鲁棒的方法。

Method: 采用梯度显著性分析揭示CNN模型的偏差，并提出基于3D点云序列的几何表示方法，分离形状和运动特征。

Result: 实验显示，在临床真实场景中，RGB模型性能下降12%，而几何方法表现更稳定，验证了几何特征的有效性。

Conclusion: 几何表示能捕捉更有意义的生物特征，为手术室中鲁棒的人员建模提供了新方向。

Abstract: Deep neural networks are prone to learning spurious correlations, exploiting
dataset-specific artifacts rather than meaningful features for prediction. In
surgical operating rooms (OR), these manifest through the standardization of
smocks and gowns that obscure robust identifying landmarks, introducing model
bias for tasks related to modeling OR personnel. Through gradient-based
saliency analysis on two public OR datasets, we reveal that CNN models succumb
to such shortcuts, fixating on incidental visual cues such as footwear beneath
surgical gowns, distinctive eyewear, or other role-specific identifiers.
Avoiding such biases is essential for the next generation of intelligent
assistance systems in the OR, which should accurately recognize personalized
workflow traits, such as surgical skill level or coordination with other staff
members. We address this problem by encoding personnel as 3D point cloud
sequences, disentangling identity-relevant shape and motion patterns from
appearance-based confounders. Our experiments demonstrate that while RGB and
geometric methods achieve comparable performance on datasets with apparent
simulation artifacts, RGB models suffer a 12% accuracy drop in realistic
clinical settings with decreased visual diversity due to standardizations. This
performance gap confirms that geometric representations capture more meaningful
biometric features, providing an avenue to developing robust methods of
modeling humans in the OR.

Conclusion: TRIDE通过多模态融合和天气适应机制，显著提升了深度估计的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Depth estimation, essential for autonomous driving, seeks to interpret the 3D
environment surrounding vehicles. The development of radar sensors, known for
their cost-efficiency and robustness, has spurred interest in radar-camera
fusion-based solutions. However, existing algorithms fuse features from these
modalities without accounting for weather conditions, despite radars being
known to be more robust than cameras under adverse weather. Additionally, while
Vision-Language models have seen rapid advancement, utilizing language
descriptions alongside other modalities for depth estimation remains an open
challenge. This paper first introduces a text-generation strategy along with
feature extraction and fusion techniques that can assist monocular depth
estimation pipelines, leading to improved accuracy across different algorithms
on the KITTI dataset. Building on this, we propose TRIDE, a radar-camera fusion
algorithm that enhances text feature extraction by incorporating radar point
information. To address the impact of weather on sensor performance, we
introduce a weather-aware fusion block that adaptively adjusts radar weighting
based on current weather conditions. Our method, benchmarked on the nuScenes
dataset, demonstrates performance gains over the state-of-the-art, achieving a
12.87% improvement in MAE and a 9.08% improvement in RMSE. Code:

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多种生成模型上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为生成高质量3D视频提供了一种高效且无需额外训练的解决方案。

Abstract: While video generation models excel at producing high-quality monocular
videos, generating 3D stereoscopic and spatial videos for immersive
applications remains an underexplored challenge. We present a pose-free and
training-free method that leverages an off-the-shelf monocular video generation
model to produce immersive 3D videos. Our approach first warps the generated
monocular video into pre-defined camera viewpoints using estimated depth
information, then applies a novel \textit{frame matrix} inpainting framework.
This framework utilizes the original video generation model to synthesize
missing content across different viewpoints and timestamps, ensuring spatial
and temporal consistency without requiring additional model fine-tuning.
Moreover, we develop a \dualupdate~scheme that further improves the quality of
video inpainting by alleviating the negative effects propagated from
disoccluded areas in the latent space. The resulting multi-view videos are then
adapted into stereoscopic pairs or optimized into 4D Gaussians for spatial
video synthesis. We validate the efficacy of our proposed method by conducting
experiments on videos from various generative models, such as Sora, Lumiere,
WALT, and Zeroscope. The experiments demonstrate that our method has a
significant improvement over previous methods. Project page at:

Result: 在NYU fastMRI数据集上，PrIINeR优于现有INR和部分学习型方法，显著提升结构保留和保真度。

Conclusion: PrIINeR为高质量加速MRI重建提供了可靠方案，结合了深度学习和INR技术。

Abstract: Accelerating Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) reduces scan time but often
degrades image quality. While Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) show
promise for MRI reconstruction, they struggle at high acceleration factors due
to weak prior constraints, leading to structural loss and aliasing artefacts.
To address this, we propose PrIINeR, an INR-based MRI reconstruction method
that integrates prior knowledge from pre-trained deep learning models into the
INR framework. By combining population-level knowledge with instance-based
optimization and enforcing dual data consistency, PrIINeR aligns both with the
acquired k-space data and the prior-informed reconstruction. Evaluated on the
NYU fastMRI dataset, our method not only outperforms state-of-the-art INR-based
approaches but also improves upon several learning-based state-of-the-art
methods, significantly improving structural preservation and fidelity while
effectively removing aliasing artefacts.PrIINeR bridges deep learning and
INR-based techniques, offering a more reliable solution for high-quality,
accelerated MRI reconstruction. The code is publicly available on

Result: 优化后的MLLM在RefCOCO/+/g上分别提升了+5.6%、+6.9%和+7.0%。

Conclusion: 本文的研究为MLLMs在视觉定位任务中的设计提供了系统性指导，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Fine-grained multimodal capability in Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) has emerged as a critical research direction, particularly for tackling
the visual grounding (VG) problem. Despite the strong performance achieved by
existing approaches, they often employ disparate design choices when
fine-tuning MLLMs for VG, lacking systematic verification to support these
designs. To bridge this gap, this paper presents a comprehensive study of
various design choices that impact the VG performance of MLLMs. We conduct our
analysis using LLaVA-1.5, which has been widely adopted in prior empirical
studies of MLLMs. While more recent models exist, we follow this convention to
ensure our findings remain broadly applicable and extendable to other
architectures. We cover two key aspects: (1) exploring different visual
grounding paradigms in MLLMs, identifying the most effective design, and
providing our insights; and (2) conducting ablation studies on the design of
grounding data to optimize MLLMs' fine-tuning for the VG task. Finally, our
findings contribute to a stronger MLLM for VG, achieving improvements of +5.6%
/ +6.9% / +7.0% on RefCOCO/+/g over the LLaVA-1.5.

Motivation: 现有方法难以区分因果和无关特征，影响了医学图像多标签分类的准确性和可解释性。

Method: 提出结构因果模型（SCM）和信息瓶颈因果注意力（IBCA），结合高斯混合多标签空间注意力和对比增强因果干预。

Result: 在Endo和MuReD数据集上，IBCA在多项指标上显著优于其他方法，如CR、OR和mAP。

Conclusion: IBCA能有效学习区分性类别特定注意力，提升医学图像多标签分类性能。

Abstract: Multi-label classification (MLC) of medical images aims to identify multiple
diseases and holds significant clinical potential. A critical step is to learn
class-specific features for accurate diagnosis and improved interpretability
effectively. However, current works focus primarily on causal attention to
learn class-specific features, yet they struggle to interpret the true cause
due to the inadvertent attention to class-irrelevant features. To address this
challenge, we propose a new structural causal model (SCM) that treats
class-specific attention as a mixture of causal, spurious, and noisy factors,
and a novel Information Bottleneck-based Causal Attention (IBCA) that is
capable of learning the discriminative class-specific attention for MLC of
medical images. Specifically, we propose learning Gaussian mixture multi-label
spatial attention to filter out class-irrelevant information and capture each
class-specific attention pattern. Then a contrastive enhancement-based causal
intervention is proposed to gradually mitigate the spurious attention and
reduce noise information by aligning multi-head attention with the Gaussian
mixture multi-label spatial. Quantitative and ablation results on Endo and
MuReD show that IBCA outperforms all methods. Compared to the second-best
results for each metric, IBCA achieves improvements of 6.35\% in CR, 7.72\% in
OR, and 5.02\% in mAP for MuReD, 1.47\% in CR, and 1.65\% in CF1, and 1.42\% in
mAP for Endo.

Result: 实验表明，所提方法在性能上达到最优。

Conclusion: ME-TST和ME-TST+通过改进时间动态建模和任务协同，显著提升了微表情分析的精度。

Abstract: Micro-expressions (MEs) are regarded as important indicators of an
individual's intrinsic emotions, preferences, and tendencies. ME analysis
requires spotting of ME intervals within long video sequences and recognition
of their corresponding emotional categories. Previous deep learning approaches
commonly employ sliding-window classification networks. However, the use of
fixed window lengths and hard classification presents notable limitations in
practice. Furthermore, these methods typically treat ME spotting and
recognition as two separate tasks, overlooking the essential relationship
between them. To address these challenges, this paper proposes two state space
model-based architectures, namely ME-TST and ME-TST+, which utilize temporal
state transition mechanisms to replace conventional window-level classification
with video-level regression. This enables a more precise characterization of
the temporal dynamics of MEs and supports the modeling of MEs with varying
durations. In ME-TST+, we further introduce multi-granularity ROI modeling and
the slowfast Mamba framework to alleviate information loss associated with
treating ME analysis as a time-series task. Additionally, we propose a synergy
strategy for spotting and recognition at both the feature and result levels,
leveraging their intrinsic connection to enhance overall analysis performance.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed methods achieve
state-of-the-art performance. The codes are available at

Abstract: Depression is a major mental health condition that severely impacts the
emotional and physical well-being of individuals. The simple nature of data
collection from social media platforms has attracted significant interest in
properly utilizing this information for mental health research. A Multimodal
Depression Detection Network (MDD-Net), utilizing acoustic and visual data
obtained from social media networks, is proposed in this work where mutual
transformers are exploited to efficiently extract and fuse multimodal features
for efficient depression detection. The MDD-Net consists of four core modules:
an acoustic feature extraction module for retrieving relevant acoustic
attributes, a visual feature extraction module for extracting significant
high-level patterns, a mutual transformer for computing the correlations among
the generated features and fusing these features from multiple modalities, and
a detection layer for detecting depression using the fused feature
representations. The extensive experiments are performed using the multimodal
D-Vlog dataset, and the findings reveal that the developed multimodal
depression detection network surpasses the state-of-the-art by up to 17.37% for
F1-Score, demonstrating the greater performance of the proposed system. The

Result: 在复杂根系数据集上测试，提取的3D骨架与真实结构高度相似。

Conclusion: 该方法可应用于自动化育种机器人，提升育种效率，推动现代农业发展。

Abstract: Plant roots typically exhibit a highly complex and dense architecture,
incorporating numerous slender lateral roots and branches, which significantly
hinders the precise capture and modeling of the entire root system.
Additionally, roots often lack sufficient texture and color information, making
it difficult to identify and track root traits using visual methods. Previous
research on roots has been largely confined to 2D studies; however, exploring
the 3D architecture of roots is crucial in botany. Since roots grow in real 3D
space, 3D phenotypic information is more critical for studying genetic traits
and their impact on root development. We have introduced a 3D root skeleton
extraction method that efficiently derives the 3D architecture of plant roots
from a few images. This method includes the detection and matching of lateral
roots, triangulation to extract the skeletal structure of lateral roots, and
the integration of lateral and primary roots. We developed a highly complex
root dataset and tested our method on it. The extracted 3D root skeletons
showed considerable similarity to the ground truth, validating the
effectiveness of the model. This method can play a significant role in
automated breeding robots. Through precise 3D root structure analysis, breeding
robots can better identify plant phenotypic traits, especially root structure
and growth patterns, helping practitioners select seeds with superior root
systems. This automated approach not only improves breeding efficiency but also
reduces manual intervention, making the breeding process more intelligent and
efficient, thus advancing modern agriculture.

Conclusion: 该研究探索了新范式，通过多层级表示提升了多模态任务的性能。

Abstract: This paper introduces TBAC-UniImage, a novel unified model for multimodal
understanding and generation. We achieve this by deeply integrating a
pre-trained Diffusion Model, acting as a generative ladder, with a Multimodal
Large Language Model (MLLM). Previous diffusion-based unified models face two
primary limitations. One approach uses only the MLLM's final hidden state as
the generative condition. This creates a shallow connection, as the generator
is isolated from the rich, hierarchical representations within the MLLM's
intermediate layers. The other approach, pretraining a unified generative
architecture from scratch, is computationally expensive and prohibitive for
many researchers. To overcome these issues, our work explores a new paradigm.
Instead of relying on a single output, we use representations from multiple,
diverse layers of the MLLM as generative conditions for the diffusion model.
This method treats the pre-trained generator as a ladder, receiving guidance
from various depths of the MLLM's understanding process. Consequently,
TBAC-UniImage achieves a much deeper and more fine-grained unification of
understanding and generation.

deep learning. Representative applications across Earth observation, precision
agriculture, biomedicine, industrial inspection, cultural heritage, and
security are also discussed, emphasizing HSI's ability to uncover sub-visual

challenges, such as hardware trade-offs, acquisition variability, and the
complexity of high-dimensional data, are examined alongside emerging solutions,
including computational imaging, physics-informed modeling, cross-modal fusion,

evolves into a general-purpose, cross-disciplinary platform, it holds promise
for transformative applications in science, technology, and society.

Conclusion: GRASPTrack通过3D几何推理和动态噪声补偿，显著提升了多目标跟踪在复杂场景中的性能。

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) in monocular videos is fundamentally challenged
by occlusions and depth ambiguity, issues that conventional
tracking-by-detection (TBD) methods struggle to resolve owing to a lack of
geometric awareness. To address these limitations, we introduce GRASPTrack, a
novel depth-aware MOT framework that integrates monocular depth estimation and
instance segmentation into a standard TBD pipeline to generate high-fidelity 3D
point clouds from 2D detections, thereby enabling explicit 3D geometric
reasoning. These 3D point clouds are then voxelized to enable a precise and
robust Voxel-Based 3D Intersection-over-Union (IoU) for spatial association. To
further enhance tracking robustness, our approach incorporates Depth-aware
Adaptive Noise Compensation, which dynamically adjusts the Kalman filter
process noise based on occlusion severity for more reliable state estimation.
Additionally, we propose a Depth-enhanced Observation-Centric Momentum, which
extends the motion direction consistency from the image plane into 3D space to
improve motion-based association cues, particularly for objects with complex
trajectories. Extensive experiments on the MOT17, MOT20, and DanceTrack
benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance,
significantly improving tracking robustness in complex scenes with frequent
occlusions and intricate motion patterns.

TL;DR: 提出Follow-Your-Shape框架，支持精确可控的形状编辑，避免背景质量下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有流式图像编辑模型在大规模形状变换任务中表现不佳，无法精准控制目标形状或避免非目标区域被修改。

Method: 通过计算轨迹差异图（TDM）定位可编辑区域，并结合Scheduled KV Injection机制实现稳定编辑。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在形状替换任务中表现出更高的编辑能力和视觉保真度。

Conclusion: Follow-Your-Shape框架为形状编辑提供了高效且可控的解决方案。

Abstract: While recent flow-based image editing models demonstrate general-purpose
capabilities across diverse tasks, they often struggle to specialize in
challenging scenarios -- particularly those involving large-scale shape
transformations. When performing such structural edits, these methods either
fail to achieve the intended shape change or inadvertently alter non-target
regions, resulting in degraded background quality. We propose
Follow-Your-Shape, a training-free and mask-free framework that supports
precise and controllable editing of object shapes while strictly preserving
non-target content. Motivated by the divergence between inversion and editing
trajectories, we compute a Trajectory Divergence Map (TDM) by comparing
token-wise velocity differences between the inversion and denoising paths. The
TDM enables precise localization of editable regions and guides a Scheduled KV
Injection mechanism that ensures stable and faithful editing. To facilitate a
rigorous evaluation, we introduce ReShapeBench, a new benchmark comprising 120
new images and enriched prompt pairs specifically curated for shape-aware
editing. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior editability
and visual fidelity, particularly in tasks requiring large-scale shape
replacement.

Conclusion: FantasyStyle通过创新的技术解决了现有挑战，显著提升了3D风格迁移的效果。

Abstract: The success of 3DGS in generative and editing applications has sparked
growing interest in 3DGS-based style transfer. However, current methods still
face two major challenges: (1) multi-view inconsistency often leads to style
conflicts, resulting in appearance smoothing and distortion; and (2) heavy
reliance on VGG features, which struggle to disentangle style and content from
style images, often causing content leakage and excessive stylization. To
tackle these issues, we introduce \textbf{FantasyStyle}, a 3DGS-based style
transfer framework, and the first to rely entirely on diffusion model
distillation. It comprises two key components: (1) \textbf{Multi-View Frequency
Consistency}. We enhance cross-view consistency by applying a 3D filter to
multi-view noisy latent, selectively reducing low-frequency components to
mitigate stylized prior conflicts. (2) \textbf{Controllable Stylized
Distillation}. To suppress content leakage from style images, we introduce
negative guidance to exclude undesired content. In addition, we identify the
limitations of Score Distillation Sampling and Delta Denoising Score in 3D
style transfer and remove the reconstruction term accordingly. Building on
these insights, we propose a controllable stylized distillation that leverages
negative guidance to more effectively optimize the 3D Gaussians. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches, achieving higher stylization quality and visual
realism across various scenes and styles.

Conclusion: TUNA方法有效结合了任务特定和通用知识，提升了类增量学习的性能。

Abstract: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) requires a learning system to continually
learn new classes without forgetting. Existing pre-trained model-based CIL
methods often freeze the pre-trained network and adapt to incremental tasks
using additional lightweight modules such as adapters. However, incorrect
module selection during inference hurts performance, and task-specific modules
often overlook shared general knowledge, leading to errors on distinguishing
between similar classes across tasks. To address the aforementioned challenges,
we propose integrating Task-Specific and Universal Adapters (TUNA) in this
paper. Specifically, we train task-specific adapters to capture the most
crucial features relevant to their respective tasks and introduce an
entropy-based selection mechanism to choose the most suitable adapter.
Furthermore, we leverage an adapter fusion strategy to construct a universal
adapter, which encodes the most discriminative features shared across tasks. We
combine task-specific and universal adapter predictions to harness both
specialized and general knowledge during inference. Extensive experiments on
various benchmark datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our
approach. Code is available at: https://github.com/LAMDA-CL/ICCV2025-TUNA

Motivation: 现有仿真环境与现实差异大，且受限于训练数据分布，难以处理新轨迹或极端场景。

Method: 提出ReconDreamer-RL框架，包括ReconSimulator（结合视频扩散先验和运动学模型）、DAA（生成极端场景）和CTG（解决数据分布偏差）。

Result: 实验显示，ReconDreamer-RL在碰撞率上比模仿学习方法降低5倍。

Conclusion: 该方法有效缩小仿真与现实差距，提升自动驾驶训练性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning for training end-to-end autonomous driving models in
closed-loop simulations is gaining growing attention. However, most simulation
environments differ significantly from real-world conditions, creating a
substantial simulation-to-reality (sim2real) gap. To bridge this gap, some
approaches utilize scene reconstruction techniques to create photorealistic
environments as a simulator. While this improves realistic sensor simulation,
these methods are inherently constrained by the distribution of the training
data, making it difficult to render high-quality sensor data for novel
trajectories or corner case scenarios. Therefore, we propose ReconDreamer-RL, a
framework designed to integrate video diffusion priors into scene
reconstruction to aid reinforcement learning, thereby enhancing end-to-end
autonomous driving training. Specifically, in ReconDreamer-RL, we introduce
ReconSimulator, which combines the video diffusion prior for appearance
modeling and incorporates a kinematic model for physical modeling, thereby
reconstructing driving scenarios from real-world data. This narrows the
sim2real gap for closed-loop evaluation and reinforcement learning. To cover
more corner-case scenarios, we introduce the Dynamic Adversary Agent (DAA),
which adjusts the trajectories of surrounding vehicles relative to the ego
vehicle, autonomously generating corner-case traffic scenarios (e.g., cut-in).
Finally, the Cousin Trajectory Generator (CTG) is proposed to address the issue
of training data distribution, which is often biased toward simple
straight-line movements. Experiments show that ReconDreamer-RL improves
end-to-end autonomous driving training, outperforming imitation learning
methods with a 5x reduction in the Collision Ratio.

Conclusion: CD-TVD显著减少对高分辨率数据的依赖，为大规模科学模拟的数据增强提供新方法。

Abstract: Large-scale scientific simulations require significant resources to generate
high-resolution time-varying data (TVD). While super-resolution is an efficient
post-processing strategy to reduce costs, existing methods rely on a large
amount of HR training data, limiting their applicability to diverse simulation
scenarios. To address this constraint, we proposed CD-TVD, a novel framework
that combines contrastive learning and an improved diffusion-based
super-resolution model to achieve accurate 3D super-resolution from limited
time-step high-resolution data. During pre-training on historical simulation
data, the contrastive encoder and diffusion superresolution modules learn
degradation patterns and detailed features of high-resolution and
low-resolution samples. In the training phase, the improved diffusion model
with a local attention mechanism is fine-tuned using only one newly generated
high-resolution timestep, leveraging the degradation knowledge learned by the
encoder. This design minimizes the reliance on large-scale high-resolution
datasets while maintaining the capability to recover fine-grained details.
Experimental results on fluid and atmospheric simulation datasets confirm that
CD-TVD delivers accurate and resource-efficient 3D super-resolution, marking a
significant advancement in data augmentation for large-scale scientific
simulations. The code is available at

Conclusion: 强化学习在可解释的医学图像定位中具有显著潜力，MedReasoner框架为临床实践提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurately grounding regions of interest (ROIs) is critical for diagnosis and
treatment planning in medical imaging. While multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) combine visual perception with natural language, current
medical-grounding pipelines still rely on supervised fine-tuning with explicit
spatial hints, making them ill-equipped to handle the implicit queries common
in clinical practice. This work makes three core contributions. We first define
Unified Medical Reasoning Grounding (UMRG), a novel vision-language task that
demands clinical reasoning and pixel-level grounding. Second, we release
U-MRG-14K, a dataset of 14K samples featuring pixel-level masks alongside
implicit clinical queries and reasoning traces, spanning 10 modalities, 15
super-categories, and 108 specific categories. Finally, we introduce
MedReasoner, a modular framework that distinctly separates reasoning from
segmentation: an MLLM reasoner is optimized with reinforcement learning, while
a frozen segmentation expert converts spatial prompts into masks, with
alignment achieved through format and accuracy rewards. MedReasoner achieves
state-of-the-art performance on U-MRG-14K and demonstrates strong
generalization to unseen clinical queries, underscoring the significant promise
of reinforcement learning for interpretable medical grounding.

Motivation: RGBD相机虽普及但深度数据在3D人体网格估计中未充分利用，且现有数据集小且多样性不足。

Method: 利用MoCap数据集生成虚拟单视角深度数据，训练掩码自编码器补全网格，匹配传感器深度值生成完整网格。

Conclusion: M$^3$方法有效利用深度数据，显著提升3D人体网格估计精度，代码将开源。

Abstract: Despite significant progress in 3D human mesh estimation from RGB images;
RGBD cameras, offering additional depth data, remain underutilized. In this
paper, we present a method for accurate 3D human mesh estimation from a single
RGBD view, leveraging the affordability and widespread adoption of RGBD cameras
for real-world applications. A fully supervised approach for this problem,
requires a dataset with RGBD image and 3D mesh label pairs. However, collecting
such a dataset is costly and challenging, hence, existing datasets are small,
and limited in pose and shape diversity. To overcome this data scarcity, we
leverage existing Motion Capture (MoCap) datasets. We first obtain complete 3D
meshes from the body models found in MoCap datasets, and create partial,
single-view versions of them by projection to a virtual camera. This simulates
the depth data provided by an RGBD camera from a single viewpoint. Then, we
train a masked autoencoder to complete the partial, single-view mesh. During
inference, our method, which we name as M$^3$ for ``Masked Mesh Modeling'',
matches the depth values coming from the sensor to vertices of a template human
mesh, which creates a partial, single-view mesh. We effectively recover parts
of the 3D human body mesh model that are not visible, resulting in a full body
mesh. M$^3$ achieves 16.8 mm and 22.0 mm per-vertex-error (PVE) on the SURREAL
and CAPE datasets, respectively; outperforming existing methods that use
full-body point clouds as input. We obtain a competitive 70.9 PVE on the BEHAVE
dataset, outperforming a recently published RGB based method by 18.4 mm,
highlighting the usefulness of depth data. Code will be released.

Result: PP-Motion在物理对齐和人类感知保真度上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PP-Motion提供了一种更全面、客观的运动保真度评估方法，适用于多种应用场景。

Abstract: Human motion generation has found widespread applications in AR/VR, film,
sports, and medical rehabilitation, offering a cost-effective alternative to
traditional motion capture systems. However, evaluating the fidelity of such
generated motions is a crucial, multifaceted task. Although previous approaches
have attempted at motion fidelity evaluation using human perception or physical
constraints, there remains an inherent gap between human-perceived fidelity and
physical feasibility. Moreover, the subjective and coarse binary labeling of
human perception further undermines the development of a robust data-driven
metric. We address these issues by introducing a physical labeling method. This
method evaluates motion fidelity by calculating the minimum modifications
needed for a motion to align with physical laws. With this approach, we are
able to produce fine-grained, continuous physical alignment annotations that
serve as objective ground truth. With these annotations, we propose PP-Motion,
a novel data-driven metric to evaluate both physical and perceptual fidelity of
human motion. To effectively capture underlying physical priors, we employ
Pearson's correlation loss for the training of our metric. Additionally, by
incorporating a human-based perceptual fidelity loss, our metric can capture
fidelity that simultaneously considers both human perception and physical
alignment. Experimental results demonstrate that our metric, PP-Motion, not
only aligns with physical laws but also aligns better with human perception of
motion fidelity than previous work.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Transformer方法在超分辨率图像处理中存在高频率成分丢失和令牌冗余问题，影响了重建质量。

Method: THAT框架引入了Pivotal Token Selective Attention（PTSA）和Multi-level Variance-aware Feed-forward Network（MVFN），分别用于优化令牌选择和增强高频细节学习。

Result: 实验表明，THAT在标准基准测试中实现了最先进的性能，提升了重建质量和效率。

Conclusion: THAT通过改进高频特征表示和令牌选择，显著提升了超分辨率图像处理的效果。

Abstract: Transformer-based methods have demonstrated strong potential in hyperspectral
pansharpening by modeling long-range dependencies. However, their effectiveness
is often limited by redundant token representations and a lack of multi-scale
feature modeling. Hyperspectral images exhibit intrinsic spectral priors (e.g.,
abundance sparsity) and spatial priors (e.g., non-local similarity), which are
critical for accurate reconstruction. From a spectral-spatial perspective,
Vision Transformers (ViTs) face two major limitations: they struggle to
preserve high-frequency components--such as material edges and texture
transitions--and suffer from attention dispersion across redundant tokens.
These issues stem from the global self-attention mechanism, which tends to
dilute high-frequency signals and overlook localized details. To address these
challenges, we propose the Token-wise High-frequency Augmentation Transformer
(THAT), a novel framework designed to enhance hyperspectral pansharpening
through improved high-frequency feature representation and token selection.
Specifically, THAT introduces: (1) Pivotal Token Selective Attention (PTSA) to
prioritize informative tokens and suppress redundancy; (2) a Multi-level
Variance-aware Feed-forward Network (MVFN) to enhance high-frequency detail
learning. Experiments on standard benchmarks show that THAT achieves
state-of-the-art performance with improved reconstruction quality and
efficiency. The source code is available at https://github.com/kailuo93/THAT.

Conclusion: KARMA为基础设施自动化检查提供了高效且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of structural defects in civil infrastructure remains
challenging due to variable defect appearances, harsh imaging conditions, and
significant class imbalance. Current deep learning methods, despite their
effectiveness, typically require millions of parameters, rendering them
impractical for real-time inspection systems. We introduce KARMA
(Kolmogorov-Arnold Representation Mapping Architecture), a highly efficient
semantic segmentation framework that models complex defect patterns through
compositions of one-dimensional functions rather than conventional
convolutions. KARMA features three technical innovations: (1) a
parameter-efficient Tiny Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (TiKAN) module leveraging
low-rank factorization for KAN-based feature transformation; (2) an optimized
feature pyramid structure with separable convolutions for multi-scale defect
analysis; and (3) a static-dynamic prototype mechanism that enhances feature
representation for imbalanced classes. Extensive experiments on benchmark
infrastructure inspection datasets demonstrate that KARMA achieves competitive
or superior mean IoU performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches, while
using significantly fewer parameters (0.959M vs. 31.04M, a 97% reduction).
Operating at 0.264 GFLOPS, KARMA maintains inference speeds suitable for
real-time deployment, enabling practical automated infrastructure inspection
systems without compromising accuracy. The source code can be accessed at the

Abstract: Recent advances at the intersection of reinforcement learning (RL) and visual
intelligence have enabled agents that not only perceive complex visual scenes
but also reason, generate, and act within them. This survey offers a critical
and up-to-date synthesis of the field. We first formalize visual RL problems
and trace the evolution of policy-optimization strategies from RLHF to
verifiable reward paradigms, and from Proximal Policy Optimization to Group
Relative Policy Optimization. We then organize more than 200 representative
works into four thematic pillars: multi-modal large language models, visual
generation, unified model frameworks, and vision-language-action models. For
each pillar we examine algorithmic design, reward engineering, benchmark
progress, and we distill trends such as curriculum-driven training,
preference-aligned diffusion, and unified reward modeling. Finally, we review
evaluation protocols spanning set-level fidelity, sample-level preference, and
state-level stability, and we identify open challenges that include sample
efficiency, generalization, and safe deployment. Our goal is to provide
researchers and practitioners with a coherent map of the rapidly expanding
landscape of visual RL and to highlight promising directions for future
inquiry. Resources are available at:

Conclusion: Spatial-ORMLLM为手术室3D空间推理提供了高效解决方案，无需额外标注或传感器。

Abstract: Precise spatial modeling in the operating room (OR) is foundational to many
clinical tasks, supporting intraoperative awareness, hazard avoidance, and
surgical decision-making. While existing approaches leverage large-scale
multimodal datasets for latent-space alignment to implicitly learn spatial
relationships, they overlook the 3D capabilities of MLLMs. However, this
approach raises two issues: (1) Operating rooms typically lack multiple video
and audio sensors, making multimodal 3D data difficult to obtain; (2) Training
solely on readily available 2D data fails to capture fine-grained details in
complex scenes. To address this gap, we introduce Spatial-ORMLLM, the first
large vision-language model for 3D spatial reasoning in operating rooms using
only RGB modality to infer volumetric and semantic cues, enabling downstream
medical tasks with detailed and holistic spatial context. Spatial-ORMLLM
incorporates a Spatial-Enhanced Feature Fusion Block, which integrates 2D
modality inputs with rich 3D spatial knowledge extracted by the estimation
algorithm and then feeds the combined features into the visual tower. By
employing a unified end-to-end MLLM framework, it combines powerful spatial
features with textual features to deliver robust 3D scene reasoning without any
additional expert annotations or sensor inputs. Experiments on multiple
benchmark clinical datasets demonstrate that Spatial-ORMLLM achieves
state-of-the-art performance and generalizes robustly to previously unseen
surgical scenarios and downstream tasks.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for explicit
3D scene representation, yet achieving efficient and consistent 3D segmentation
remains challenging. Current methods suffer from prohibitive computational
costs, limited 3D spatial reasoning, and an inability to track multiple objects
simultaneously. We present Segment Any Gaussians Online (SAGOnline), a
lightweight and zero-shot framework for real-time 3D segmentation in Gaussian
scenes that addresses these limitations through two key innovations: (1) a
decoupled strategy that integrates video foundation models (e.g., SAM2) for
view-consistent 2D mask propagation across synthesized views; and (2) a
GPU-accelerated 3D mask generation and Gaussian-level instance labeling
algorithm that assigns unique identifiers to 3D primitives, enabling lossless
multi-object tracking and segmentation across views. SAGOnline achieves
state-of-the-art performance on NVOS (92.7% mIoU) and Spin-NeRF (95.2% mIoU)
benchmarks, outperforming Feature3DGS, OmniSeg3D-gs, and SA3D by 15--1500 times
in inference speed (27 ms/frame). Qualitative results demonstrate robust
multi-object segmentation and tracking in complex scenes. Our contributions
include: (i) a lightweight and zero-shot framework for 3D segmentation in
Gaussian scenes, (ii) explicit labeling of Gaussian primitives enabling
simultaneous segmentation and tracking, and (iii) the effective adaptation of
2D video foundation models to the 3D domain. This work allows real-time
rendering and 3D scene understanding, paving the way for practical AR/VR and
robotic applications.

Motivation: 现有方法通常依赖通用偏好或静态用户画像，忽略了用户偏好的动态性和多样性，因此需要更全面的个性化预测方法。

Method: 采用多模态大语言模型，引入对比偏好损失和偏好标记，区分用户喜好并捕捉共享兴趣表示。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在偏好预测准确性上优于其他方法，并能识别相似审美倾向的用户。

Conclusion: 该方法能更精准地生成符合用户偏好的图像，为个性化推荐提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: User preference prediction requires a comprehensive and accurate
understanding of individual tastes. This includes both surface-level
attributes, such as color and style, and deeper content-related aspects, such
as themes and composition. However, existing methods typically rely on general
human preferences or assume static user profiles, often neglecting individual
variability and the dynamic, multifaceted nature of personal taste. To address
these limitations, we propose an approach built upon Multimodal Large Language
Models, introducing contrastive preference loss and preference tokens to learn
personalized user preferences from historical interactions. The contrastive
preference loss is designed to effectively distinguish between user ''likes''
and ''dislikes'', while the learnable preference tokens capture shared interest
representations among existing users, enabling the model to activate
group-specific preferences and enhance consistency across similar users.
Extensive experiments demonstrate our model outperforms other methods in
preference prediction accuracy, effectively identifying users with similar
aesthetic inclinations and providing more precise guidance for generating
images that align with individual tastes. The project page is

Motivation: 现有的一步Real-ISR模型在初始时间步注入低质量图像潜在分布，但其与高斯噪声潜在分布存在差距，限制了生成先验的有效利用。

Method: OMGSR在中步时间步注入低质量图像潜在分布，并引入潜在分布细化损失和重叠分块LPIPS/GAN损失。

Conclusion: OMGSR框架通过中步引导和优化损失设计，显著提升了一步Real-ISR的性能，适用于多种生成模型。

Abstract: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) and Flow Matching (FM)
generative models show promising potential for one-step Real-World Image
Super-Resolution (Real-ISR). Recent one-step Real-ISR models typically inject a
Low-Quality (LQ) image latent distribution at the initial timestep. However, a
fundamental gap exists between the LQ image latent distribution and the
Gaussian noisy latent distribution, limiting the effective utilization of
generative priors. We observe that the noisy latent distribution at DDPM/FM
mid-timesteps aligns more closely with the LQ image latent distribution. Based
on this insight, we present One Mid-timestep Guidance Real-ISR (OMGSR), a
universal framework applicable to DDPM/FM-based generative models. OMGSR
injects the LQ image latent distribution at a pre-computed mid-timestep,
incorporating the proposed Latent Distribution Refinement loss to alleviate the
latent distribution gap. We also design the Overlap-Chunked LPIPS/GAN loss to
eliminate checkerboard artifacts in image generation. Within this framework, we
instantiate OMGSR for DDPM/FM-based generative models with two variants:
OMGSR-S (SD-Turbo) and OMGSR-F (FLUX.1-dev). Experimental results demonstrate
that OMGSR-S/F achieves balanced/excellent performance across quantitative and
qualitative metrics at 512-resolution. Notably, OMGSR-F establishes
overwhelming dominance in all reference metrics. We further train a
1k-resolution OMGSR-F to match the default resolution of FLUX.1-dev, which
yields excellent results, especially in the details of the image generation. We
also generate 2k-resolution images by the 1k-resolution OMGSR-F using our
two-stage Tiled VAE & Diffusion.

TL;DR: 论文提出Next Shot Generation (NSG)框架Cut2Next，通过Diffusion Transformer和Hierarchical Multi-Prompting策略生成符合专业编辑模式的高质量后续镜头。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法多关注视觉一致性，忽视了叙事流畅性和电影完整性，导致输出缺乏叙事深度。

Method: 采用Diffusion Transformer (DiT)和Hierarchical Multi-Prompting策略，结合Context-Aware Condition Injection (CACI)和Hierarchical Attention Mask (HAM)技术。

Result: Cut2Next在视觉一致性和文本保真度上表现优异，用户研究显示其更符合编辑模式和电影连续性。

Conclusion: Cut2Next能生成高质量、叙事表达丰富且电影连贯的后续镜头。

Abstract: Effective multi-shot generation demands purposeful, film-like transitions and
strict cinematic continuity. Current methods, however, often prioritize basic
visual consistency, neglecting crucial editing patterns (e.g., shot/reverse
shot, cutaways) that drive narrative flow for compelling storytelling. This
yields outputs that may be visually coherent but lack narrative sophistication
and true cinematic integrity. To bridge this, we introduce Next Shot Generation
(NSG): synthesizing a subsequent, high-quality shot that critically conforms to
professional editing patterns while upholding rigorous cinematic continuity.
Our framework, Cut2Next, leverages a Diffusion Transformer (DiT). It employs
in-context tuning guided by a novel Hierarchical Multi-Prompting strategy. This
strategy uses Relational Prompts to define overall context and inter-shot
editing styles. Individual Prompts then specify per-shot content and
cinematographic attributes. Together, these guide Cut2Next to generate
cinematically appropriate next shots. Architectural innovations, Context-Aware
Condition Injection (CACI) and Hierarchical Attention Mask (HAM), further
integrate these diverse signals without introducing new parameters. We
construct RawCuts (large-scale) and CuratedCuts (refined) datasets, both with
hierarchical prompts, and introduce CutBench for evaluation. Experiments show
Cut2Next excels in visual consistency and text fidelity. Crucially, user
studies reveal a strong preference for Cut2Next, particularly for its adherence
to intended editing patterns and overall cinematic continuity, validating its
ability to generate high-quality, narratively expressive, and cinematically
coherent subsequent shots.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前音频驱动的虚拟化身视频生成模型难以生成长视频，且音频同步和身份一致性表现不佳。

Method: 提出Time-step-aware Audio Adapter和Audio Native Guidance Mechanism，结合Dynamic Weighted Sliding-window Strategy优化生成过程。

Result: 实验证明StableAvatar在质量和定量评估上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: StableAvatar通过创新模块解决了长视频生成中的音频同步和分布漂移问题，实现了高质量无限长度视频生成。

Abstract: Current diffusion models for audio-driven avatar video generation struggle to
synthesize long videos with natural audio synchronization and identity
consistency. This paper presents StableAvatar, the first end-to-end video
diffusion transformer that synthesizes infinite-length high-quality videos
without post-processing. Conditioned on a reference image and audio,
StableAvatar integrates tailored training and inference modules to enable
infinite-length video generation. We observe that the main reason preventing
existing models from generating long videos lies in their audio modeling. They
typically rely on third-party off-the-shelf extractors to obtain audio
embeddings, which are then directly injected into the diffusion model via
cross-attention. Since current diffusion backbones lack any audio-related
priors, this approach causes severe latent distribution error accumulation
across video clips, leading the latent distribution of subsequent segments to
drift away from the optimal distribution gradually. To address this,
StableAvatar introduces a novel Time-step-aware Audio Adapter that prevents
error accumulation via time-step-aware modulation. During inference, we propose
a novel Audio Native Guidance Mechanism to further enhance the audio
synchronization by leveraging the diffusion's own evolving joint audio-latent
prediction as a dynamic guidance signal. To enhance the smoothness of the
infinite-length videos, we introduce a Dynamic Weighted Sliding-window Strategy
that fuses latent over time. Experiments on benchmarks show the effectiveness
of StableAvatar both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Conclusion: R3DGS任务和ReferSplat框架为3D多模态理解提供了新方向，数据集和代码已开源。

Abstract: We introduce Referring 3D Gaussian Splatting Segmentation (R3DGS), a new task
that aims to segment target objects in a 3D Gaussian scene based on natural
language descriptions, which often contain spatial relationships or object
attributes. This task requires the model to identify newly described objects
that may be occluded or not directly visible in a novel view, posing a
significant challenge for 3D multi-modal understanding. Developing this
capability is crucial for advancing embodied AI. To support research in this
area, we construct the first R3DGS dataset, Ref-LERF. Our analysis reveals that
3D multi-modal understanding and spatial relationship modeling are key
challenges for R3DGS. To address these challenges, we propose ReferSplat, a
framework that explicitly models 3D Gaussian points with natural language
expressions in a spatially aware paradigm. ReferSplat achieves state-of-the-art
performance on both the newly proposed R3DGS task and 3D open-vocabulary
segmentation benchmarks. Dataset and code are available at

Result: 实验表明，该方法能生成物理合理的动画，性能显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法成功模拟了人类对4D场景的想象能力，为自然流体动画提供了新思路。

Abstract: Humans possess an exceptional ability to imagine 4D scenes, encompassing both
motion and 3D geometry, from a single still image. This ability is rooted in
our accumulated observations of similar scenes and an intuitive understanding
of physics. In this paper, we aim to replicate this capacity in neural
networks, specifically focusing on natural fluid imagery. Existing methods for
this task typically employ simplistic 2D motion estimators to animate the
image, leading to motion predictions that often defy physical principles,
resulting in unrealistic animations. Our approach introduces a novel method for
generating 4D scenes with physics-consistent animation from a single image. We
propose the use of a physics-informed neural network that predicts motion for
each surface point, guided by a loss term derived from fundamental physical
principles, including the Navier-Stokes equations. To capture appearance, we
predict feature-based 3D Gaussians from the input image and its estimated
depth, which are then animated using the predicted motions and rendered from
any desired camera perspective. Experimental results highlight the
effectiveness of our method in producing physically plausible animations,
showcasing significant performance improvements over existing methods. Our

Conclusion: 该方法为冠状动脉自动标记提供了有前景的替代方案。

Abstract: Coronary artery disease (CAD) remains the leading cause of death globally,
with computed tomography coronary angiography (CTCA) serving as a key
diagnostic tool. However, coronary arterial analysis using CTCA, such as
identifying artery-specific features from computational modelling, is
labour-intensive and time-consuming. Automated anatomical labelling of coronary
arteries offers a potential solution, yet the inherent anatomical variability
of coronary trees presents a significant challenge. Traditional knowledge-based
labelling methods fall short in leveraging data-driven insights, while recent
deep-learning approaches often demand substantial computational resources and
overlook critical clinical knowledge. To address these limitations, we propose
a lightweight method that integrates anatomical knowledge with rule-based
topology constraints for effective coronary artery labelling. Our approach
achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets, providing a
promising alternative for automated coronary artery labelling.

Abstract: Accurate and interpretable classification of brain tumors from magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) is critical for effective diagnosis and treatment
planning. This study presents an ensemble-based deep learning framework that
combines MobileNetV2 and DenseNet121 convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using
a soft voting strategy to classify three common brain tumor types: glioma,
meningioma, and pituitary adenoma. The models were trained and evaluated on the
Figshare dataset using a stratified 5-fold cross-validation protocol. To
enhance transparency and clinical trust, the framework integrates an
Explainable AI (XAI) module employing Grad-CAM++ for class-specific saliency
visualization, alongside a symbolic Clinical Decision Rule Overlay (CDRO) that
maps predictions to established radiological heuristics. The ensemble
classifier achieved superior performance compared to individual CNNs, with an
accuracy of 91.7%, precision of 91.9%, recall of 91.7%, and F1-score of 91.6%.
Grad-CAM++ visualizations revealed strong spatial alignment between model
attention and expert-annotated tumor regions, supported by Dice coefficients up
to 0.88 and IoU scores up to 0.78. Clinical rule activation further validated
model predictions in cases with distinct morphological features. A
human-centered interpretability assessment involving five board-certified
radiologists yielded high Likert-scale scores for both explanation usefulness
(mean = 4.4) and heatmap-region correspondence (mean = 4.0), reinforcing the
framework's clinical relevance. Overall, the proposed approach offers a robust,
interpretable, and generalizable solution for automated brain tumor
classification, advancing the integration of deep learning into clinical
neurodiagnostics.

Abstract: Image-based personalized medicine has the potential to transform healthcare,
particularly for diseases that exhibit heterogeneous progression such as
Multiple Sclerosis (MS). In this work, we introduce the first treatment-aware
spatio-temporal diffusion model that is able to generate future masks
demonstrating lesion evolution in MS. Our voxel-space approach incorporates
multi-modal patient data, including MRI and treatment information, to forecast
new and enlarging T2 (NET2) lesion masks at a future time point. Extensive
experiments on a multi-centre dataset of 2131 patient 3D MRIs from randomized
clinical trials for relapsing-remitting MS demonstrate that our generative
model is able to accurately predict NET2 lesion masks for patients across six
different treatments. Moreover, we demonstrate our model has the potential for
real-world clinical applications through downstream tasks such as future lesion
count and location estimation, binary lesion activity classification, and
generating counterfactual future NET2 masks for several treatments with
different efficacies. This work highlights the potential of causal, image-based
generative models as powerful tools for advancing data-driven prognostics in
MS.

Motivation: LLMs在医学影像任务中的应用日益增多，但其产生的幻觉（自信但错误的输出）可能误导临床决策，因此需要系统研究。

Method: 研究从两个方向分析幻觉：图像到文本（生成报告）和文本到图像（生成图像），使用专家标准评估错误（如事实不一致和解剖学不准确）。

Result: 发现幻觉在解释性和生成性任务中均存在常见模式，并探讨了模型架构和训练数据等失败因素。

Conclusion: 通过系统研究，为提升LLM驱动的医学影像系统的安全性和可信度提供了见解。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to medical imaging
tasks, including image interpretation and synthetic image generation. However,
these models often produce hallucinations, which are confident but incorrect
outputs that can mislead clinical decisions. This study examines hallucinations
in two directions: image to text, where LLMs generate reports from X-ray, CT,
or MRI scans, and text to image, where models create medical images from
clinical prompts. We analyze errors such as factual inconsistencies and
anatomical inaccuracies, evaluating outputs using expert informed criteria
across imaging modalities. Our findings reveal common patterns of hallucination
in both interpretive and generative tasks, with implications for clinical
reliability. We also discuss factors contributing to these failures, including
model architecture and training data. By systematically studying both image
understanding and generation, this work provides insights into improving the
safety and trustworthiness of LLM driven medical imaging systems.

Conclusion: SAGCNet有效解决了MRI缺失切片合成问题，为临床诊断提供了更可靠的工具。

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides detailed soft-tissue
characteristics that assist in disease diagnosis and screening. However, the
accuracy of clinical practice is often hindered by missing or unusable slices
due to various factors. Volumetric MRI synthesis methods have been developed to
address this issue by imputing missing slices from available ones. The inherent
3D nature of volumetric MRI data, such as cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR),
poses significant challenges for missing slice imputation approaches, including
(1) the difficulty of modeling local inter-slice correlations and dependencies
of volumetric slices, and (2) the limited exploration of crucial 3D spatial
information and global context. In this study, to mitigate these issues, we
present Spatial-Aware Graph Completion Network (SAGCNet) to overcome the
dependency on complete volumetric data, featuring two main innovations: (1) a
volumetric slice graph completion module that incorporates the inter-slice
relationships into a graph structure, and (2) a volumetric spatial adapter
component that enables our model to effectively capture and utilize various
forms of 3D spatial context. Extensive experiments on cardiac MRI datasets
demonstrate that SAGCNet is capable of synthesizing absent CMR slices,
outperforming competitive state-of-the-art MRI synthesis methods both
quantitatively and qualitatively. Notably, our model maintains superior
performance even with limited slice data.

Abstract: Multi-sequence Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) offers remarkable
versatility, enabling the distinct visualization of different tissue types.
Nevertheless, the inherent heterogeneity among MRI sequences poses significant
challenges to the generalization capability of deep learning models. These
challenges undermine model performance when faced with varying acquisition
parameters, thereby severely restricting their clinical utility. In this study,
we present PRISM, a foundation model PRe-trained with large-scale
multI-Sequence MRI. We collected a total of 64 datasets from both public and
private sources, encompassing a wide range of whole-body anatomical structures,
with scans spanning diverse MRI sequences. Among them, 336,476 volumetric MRI
scans from 34 datasets (8 public and 26 private) were curated to construct the
largest multi-organ multi-sequence MRI pretraining corpus to date. We propose a
novel pretraining paradigm that disentangles anatomically invariant features
from sequence-specific variations in MRI, while preserving high-level semantic
representations. We established a benchmark comprising 44 downstream tasks,
including disease diagnosis, image segmentation, registration, progression
prediction, and report generation. These tasks were evaluated on 32 public
datasets and 5 private cohorts. PRISM consistently outperformed both
non-pretrained models and existing foundation models, achieving first-rank
results in 39 out of 44 downstream benchmarks with statistical significance
improvements. These results underscore its ability to learn robust and
generalizable representations across unseen data acquired under diverse MRI
protocols. PRISM provides a scalable framework for multi-sequence MRI analysis,
thereby enhancing the translational potential of AI in radiology. It delivers
consistent performance across diverse imaging protocols, reinforcing its
clinical applicability.

Conclusion: HaDM-ST通过结合H&E图像和低分辨率ST，显著提升了空间转录组学的高分辨率预测能力。

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics (ST) reveals spatial heterogeneity of gene
expression, yet its resolution is limited by current platforms. Recent methods
enhance resolution via H&E-stained histology, but three major challenges
persist: (1) isolating expression-relevant features from visually complex H&E
images; (2) achieving spatially precise multimodal alignment in diffusion-based
frameworks; and (3) modeling gene-specific variation across expression
channels. We propose HaDM-ST (Histology-assisted Differential Modeling for ST
Generation), a high-resolution ST generation framework conditioned on H&E
images and low-resolution ST. HaDM-ST includes: (i) a semantic distillation
network to extract predictive cues from H&E; (ii) a spatial alignment module
enforcing pixel-wise correspondence with low-resolution ST; and (iii) a
channel-aware adversarial learner for fine-grained gene-level modeling.
Experiments on 200 genes across diverse tissues and species show HaDM-ST
consistently outperforms prior methods, enhancing spatial fidelity and

Motivation: 传统多步扩散方法效率低，DiffVC-OSD旨在通过一步扩散提升压缩效率和感知质量。

Method: 采用一步扩散模型，结合时间上下文适配器和端到端微调策略。

Result: DiffVC-OSD在感知压缩性能上达到最优，解码速度提升20倍，比特率降低86.92%。

Conclusion: DiffVC-OSD通过一步扩散显著提升了视频压缩的效率和感知质量。

Abstract: In this work, we first propose DiffVC-OSD, a One-Step Diffusion-based
Perceptual Neural Video Compression framework. Unlike conventional multi-step
diffusion-based methods, DiffVC-OSD feeds the reconstructed latent
representation directly into a One-Step Diffusion Model, enhancing perceptual
quality through a single diffusion step guided by both temporal context and the
latent itself. To better leverage temporal dependencies, we design a Temporal
Context Adapter that encodes conditional inputs into multi-level features,
offering more fine-grained guidance for the Denoising Unet. Additionally, we
employ an End-to-End Finetuning strategy to improve overall compression
performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiffVC-OSD achieves
state-of-the-art perceptual compression performance, offers about 20$\times$
faster decoding and a 86.92\% bitrate reduction compared to the corresponding
multi-step diffusion-based variant.

TL;DR: ALDEN是一种基于深度学习的低剂量CT去噪方法，通过结合预训练视觉模型的语义特征与对抗和对比学习，显著提升了去噪效果和解剖结构保留能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有低剂量CT去噪方法大多忽略了解剖语义信息，导致去噪效果不理想。ALDEN旨在通过引入解剖感知机制解决这一问题。

Method: ALDEN采用解剖感知判别器和语义引导的对比学习模块，结合交叉注意力机制和双负对，实现组织特异性去噪。

Result: 在两个低剂量CT去噪数据集上，ALDEN表现最优，显著减少过平滑问题，并在下游多器官分割任务中验证了解剖结构保留能力。

Conclusion: ALDEN通过解剖感知设计，显著提升了低剂量CT去噪的准确性和解剖结构保留能力，具有重要临床应用价值。

Abstract: To reduce radiation exposure and improve the diagnostic efficacy of low-dose
computed tomography (LDCT), numerous deep learning-based denoising methods have
been developed to mitigate noise and artifacts. However, most of these
approaches ignore the anatomical semantics of human tissues, which may
potentially result in suboptimal denoising outcomes. To address this problem,
we propose ALDEN, an anatomy-aware LDCT denoising method that integrates
semantic features of pretrained vision models (PVMs) with adversarial and
contrastive learning. Specifically, we introduce an anatomy-aware discriminator
that dynamically fuses hierarchical semantic features from reference
normal-dose CT (NDCT) via cross-attention mechanisms, enabling tissue-specific
realism evaluation in the discriminator. In addition, we propose a
semantic-guided contrastive learning module that enforces anatomical
consistency by contrasting PVM-derived features from LDCT, denoised CT and
NDCT, preserving tissue-specific patterns through positive pairs and
suppressing artifacts via dual negative pairs. Extensive experiments conducted
on two LDCT denoising datasets reveal that ALDEN achieves the state-of-the-art
performance, offering superior anatomy preservation and substantially reducing
over-smoothing issue of previous work. Further validation on a downstream
multi-organ segmentation task (encompassing 117 anatomical structures) affirms
the model's ability to maintain anatomical awareness.

Method: 采用EfficientNetV2S模型进行初步诊断，并通过人机反馈循环优化模型性能。

Result: 模型初始准确率为93.65%，人机协作系统进一步提升了准确性。

Conclusion: 人机协作方法为AI辅助医疗诊断提供了高效、准确的新方向。

Abstract: Invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) is the most prevalent form of breast cancer,
and early, accurate diagnosis is critical to improving patient survival rates
by guiding treatment decisions. Combining medical expertise with artificial
intelligence (AI) holds significant promise for enhancing the precision and
efficiency of IDC detection. In this work, we propose a human-in-the-loop
(HITL) deep learning system designed to detect IDC in histopathology images.
The system begins with an initial diagnosis provided by a high-performance
EfficientNetV2S model, offering feedback from AI to the human expert. Medical
professionals then review the AI-generated results, correct any misclassified
images, and integrate the revised labels into the training dataset, forming a
feedback loop from the human back to the AI. This iterative process refines the
model's performance over time. The EfficientNetV2S model itself achieves
state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods in the literature,
with an overall accuracy of 93.65\%. Incorporating the human-in-the-loop system
further improves the model's accuracy using four experimental groups with
misclassified images. These results demonstrate the potential of this
collaborative approach to enhance AI performance in diagnostic systems. This
work contributes to advancing automated, efficient, and highly accurate methods
for IDC detection through human-AI collaboration, offering a promising
direction for future AI-assisted medical diagnostics.

Abstract: Despite significant progress in generative modelling, existing diffusion
models often struggle to produce anatomically precise female pelvic images,
limiting their application in gynaecological imaging, where data scarcity and
patient privacy concerns are critical. To overcome these barriers, we introduce
a novel diffusion-based framework for uterine MRI synthesis, integrating both
unconditional and conditioned Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs)
and Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) in 2D and 3D. Our approach generates
anatomically coherent, high fidelity synthetic images that closely mimic real
scans and provide valuable resources for training robust diagnostic models. We
evaluate generative quality using advanced perceptual and distributional
metrics, benchmarking against standard reconstruction methods, and demonstrate
substantial gains in diagnostic accuracy on a key classification task. A
blinded expert evaluation further validates the clinical realism of our
synthetic images. We release our models with privacy safeguards and a
comprehensive synthetic uterine MRI dataset to support reproducible research
and advance equitable AI in gynaecology.

Abstract: We propose a deep learning-based approach that integrates MRI sequence
parameters to improve the accuracy and generalizability of quantitative image
synthesis from clinical weighted MRI. Our physics-driven neural network embeds
MRI sequence parameters -- repetition time (TR), echo time (TE), and inversion
time (TI) -- directly into the model via parameter embedding, enabling the
network to learn the underlying physical principles of MRI signal formation.
The model takes conventional T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and T2-FLAIR images as
input and synthesizes T1, T2, and proton density (PD) quantitative maps.
Trained on healthy brain MR images, it was evaluated on both internal and
external test datasets. The proposed method achieved high performance with PSNR
values exceeding 34 dB and SSIM values above 0.92 for all synthesized parameter
maps. It outperformed conventional deep learning models in accuracy and
robustness, including data with previously unseen brain structures and lesions.
Notably, our model accurately synthesized quantitative maps for these unseen
pathological regions, highlighting its superior generalization capability.
Incorporating MRI sequence parameters via parameter embedding allows the neural
network to better learn the physical characteristics of MR signals,
significantly enhancing the performance and reliability of quantitative MRI
synthesis. This method shows great potential for accelerating qMRI and
improving its clinical utility.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了高维数据在低维空间（如二维或三维）中可视化的可行性，发现大多数图需要高维嵌入才能保持邻域结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究高维数据在低维空间中可视化的限制，特别是如何保持邻域结构的分离性。

Method: 通过将图嵌入到低倍增维度的度量空间中，分析邻域和非邻域的分离性。

Result: 大多数图需要高维嵌入（如Ω(log n)），稀疏正则图也需要Ω(log n / log log n)。在赋范空间中，几乎所有图需要Θ(n)维。

Conclusion: 低维可视化难以忠实保持邻域结构，挑战了常数维可视化的可行性。

Abstract: To what extent is it possible to visualize high-dimensional datasets in a
two- or three-dimensional space? We reframe this question in terms of embedding
$n$-vertex graphs (representing the neighborhood structure of the input points)
into metric spaces of low doubling dimension $d$, in such a way that maintains
the separation between neighbors and non-neighbors. This seemingly lax
embedding requirement is surprisingly difficult to satisfy. Our investigation
shows that an overwhelming fraction of graphs require $d = \Omega(\log n)$.
Even when considering sparse regular graphs, the situation does not improve, as
an overwhelming fraction of such graphs requires $d= \Omega(\log n / \log\log
n)$. The landscape changes dramatically when embedding into normed spaces. In
particular, all but a vanishing fraction of graphs demand $d=\Theta(n)$.
Finally, we study the implications of these results for visualizing data with
intrinsic cluster structure. We find that graphs produced from a planted
partition model with $k$ clusters on $n$ points typically require
$d=\Omega(\log n)$, even when the cluster structure is salient. These results
challenge the aspiration that constant-dimensional visualizations can
faithfully preserve neighborhood structure.

Motivation: 由于chorematic图通常需要手动制作，缺乏自动化解决方案，本文旨在通过算法实现高效生成。

Method: 采用点采样策略和类点集算法，寻找最优代表某一类别的圆盘。

Result: 实验表明，适当的采样策略能在中等规模点集和秒级计算时间内获得高质量结果。

Conclusion: 该方法为自动化生成chorematic图提供了高效可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Chorematic diagrams are highly reduced schematic maps of geospatial data and
processes. They can visually summarize complex situations using only a few
simple shapes (choremes) placed upon a simplified base map. Due to the extreme
reduction of data in chorematic diagrams, they tend to be produced manually;
few automated solutions exist. In this paper we consider the algorithmic
problem of summarizing classed region maps, such as choropleth or land use
maps, using a chorematic diagram with a single disk choreme. It is infeasible
to solve this problem exactly for large maps. Hence, we propose several point
sampling strategies and use algorithms for classed point sets to efficiently
find the best disk that represents one of the classes. We implemented our
algorithm and experimentally compared sampling strategies and densities. The
results show that with the right sampling strategy, high-quality results can be
obtained already with moderately sized point sets and within seconds of
computation time.

in addressing the challenges associated with manual sewing processes.
Traditional methods for creating pleats are labour-intensive, prone to
inconsistencies, and require high levels of skill, making automation a critical

production, focusing on the creation of an automated machine capable of precise
folding and sewing operations and eliminating the marking operation.
  The proposed machine incorporates key features such as a precision folding
mechanism integrated into the automated sewing unit with real-time monitoring
capabilities. The results demonstrate remarkable improvements: the standard
labour time has been reduced by 93%, dropping from 117 seconds per piece to
just 8 seconds with the automated system. Similarly, machinery time improved by
73%, and the total output rate increased by 72%. These enhancements translate
into a cycle time reduction from 117 seconds per piece to an impressive 33
seconds, enabling manufacturers to meet customer demand more swiftly. By
eliminating manual marking processes, the machine not only reduces labour costs
but also minimizes waste through consistent pleat formation. This automation
aligns with industry trends toward sustainability and efficiency, potentially
reducing environmental impact by decreasing material waste and energy
consumption.

A deep neural network surrogate, trained on high-fidelity CFD data, predicts

Abstract: The increasing demand for critical raw materials has revitalized interest in
abandoned underground mines, which pose extreme challenges for conventional
drilling machinery due to confined, unstructured, and infrastructure-less
environments. This paper presents the Stinger Robot, a novel compact robotic
platform specifically designed for autonomous high-force drilling in such
settings. The robot features a mechanically self-locking tri-leg bracing
mechanism that enables stable anchoring to irregular tunnel surfaces. A key
innovation lies in its force-aware, closed-loop control strategy, which enables
force interaction with unstructured environments during bracing and drilling.
Implemented as a finite-state machine in ROS 2, the control policy dynamically
adapts leg deployment based on real-time contact feedback and load thresholds,
ensuring stability without external supports. We demonstrate, through
simulation and preliminary hardware tests, that the Stinger Robot can

Abstract: Evaluating and ensuring the adversarial robustness of autonomous driving (AD)
systems is a critical and unresolved challenge. This paper introduces MetAdv, a
novel adversarial testing platform that enables realistic, dynamic, and
interactive evaluation by tightly integrating virtual simulation with physical
vehicle feedback. At its core, MetAdv establishes a hybrid virtual-physical
sandbox, within which we design a three-layer closed-loop testing environment
with dynamic adversarial test evolution. This architecture facilitates
end-to-end adversarial evaluation, ranging from high-level unified adversarial
generation, through mid-level simulation-based interaction, to low-level
execution on physical vehicles. Additionally, MetAdv supports a broad spectrum
of AD tasks, algorithmic paradigms (e.g., modular deep learning pipelines,
end-to-end learning, vision-language models). It supports flexible 3D vehicle
modeling and seamless transitions between simulated and physical environments,
with built-in compatibility for commercial platforms such as Apollo and Tesla.
A key feature of MetAdv is its human-in-the-loop capability: besides flexible
environmental configuration for more customized evaluation, it enables
real-time capture of physiological signals and behavioral feedback from
drivers, offering new insights into human-machine trust under adversarial
conditions. We believe MetAdv can offer a scalable and unified framework for
adversarial assessment, paving the way for safer AD.

Abstract: Inspection of aquaculture net pens is essential for ensuring the structural
integrity and sustainable operation of offshore fish farming systems.
Traditional methods, typically based on manually operated or single-ROV
systems, offer limited adaptability to real-time constraints such as energy
consumption, hardware faults, and dynamic underwater conditions. This paper
introduces AquaChat++, a novel multi-ROV inspection framework that uses Large
Language Models (LLMs) to enable adaptive mission planning, coordinated task
execution, and fault-tolerant control in complex aquaculture environments. The
proposed system consists of a two-layered architecture. The high-level plan
generation layer employs an LLM, such as ChatGPT-4, to translate natural
language user commands into symbolic, multi-agent inspection plans. A task
manager dynamically allocates and schedules actions among ROVs based on their
real-time status and operational constraints, including thruster faults and
battery levels. The low-level control layer ensures accurate trajectory
tracking and integrates thruster fault detection and compensation mechanisms.
By incorporating real-time feedback and event-triggered replanning, AquaChat++
enhances system robustness and operational efficiency. Simulated experiments in
a physics-based aquaculture environment demonstrate improved inspection
coverage, energy-efficient behavior, and resilience to actuator failures. These
findings highlight the potential of LLM-driven frameworks to support scalable,
intelligent, and autonomous underwater robotic operations within the
aquaculture sector.

Abstract: This paper presents a new adaptive sliding mode control (SMC) framework for

quaternion-based formulations, and (iv) the gain overgrowth problem in adaptive
SMC schemes. Leveraging nonsmooth stability analysis, we provide rigorous
global stability proofs for both the nonsmooth attitude sliding dynamics
defined on $\mathbb{S}^3$ and the position sliding dynamics. Our controller is
computationally efficient and runs reliably on a resource-constrained nano
quadrotor, achieving 250 Hz and 500 Hz refresh rates for position and attitude
control, respectively. In an extensive set of hardware experiments with over
130 flight trials, the proposed controller consistently outperforms three
benchmark methods, demonstrating superior trajectory tracking accuracy and
robustness with relatively low control effort. The controller enables
aggressive maneuvers such as dynamic throw launches, flip maneuvers, and
accelerations exceeding 3g, which is remarkable for a 32-gram nano quadrotor.
These results highlight promising potential for real-world applications,
particularly in scenarios requiring robust, high-performance flight control
under significant external disturbances and tight computational constraints.

Abstract: Ensuring the safety of autonomous vehicles (AVs) is paramount in their
development and deployment. Safety-critical scenarios pose more severe
challenges, necessitating efficient testing methods to validate AVs safety.
This study focuses on designing an accelerated testing algorithm for AVs in
safety-critical scenarios, enabling swift recognition of their driving
capabilities. First, typical logical scenarios were extracted from real-world
crashes in the China In-depth Mobility Safety Study-Traffic Accident (CIMSS-TA)
database, obtaining pre-crash features through reconstruction. Second, Baidu
Apollo, an advanced black-box automated driving system (ADS) is integrated to
control the behavior of the ego vehicle. Third, we proposed an adaptive
large-variable neighborhood-simulated annealing algorithm (ALVNS-SA) to
expedite the testing process. Experimental results demonstrate a significant
enhancement in testing efficiency when utilizing ALVNS-SA. It achieves an
84.00% coverage of safety-critical scenarios, with crash scenario coverage of
96.83% and near-crash scenario coverage of 92.07%. Compared to genetic
algorithm (GA), adaptive large neighborhood-simulated annealing algorithm
(ALNS-SA), and random testing, ALVNS-SA exhibits substantially higher coverage
in safety-critical scenarios.

Result: 优化规划实现了98-100%的观测机会收集，机器学习预测准确率提升40%，数据集成后预测精度再提升13-15%。

Conclusion: 该方法显著降低了数据延迟（6-30小时），提升了野火监测和预测的准确性与实时性，具备全球推广潜力。

Abstract: We propose a novel concept of operations using optimal planning methods and
machine learning (ML) to collect spaceborne data that is unprecedented for
monitoring wildfires, process it to create new or enhanced products in the
context of wildfire danger or spread monitoring, and assimilate them to improve
existing, wildfire decision support tools delivered to firefighters within
latency appropriate for time-critical applications. The concept is studied with
respect to NASA's CYGNSS Mission, a constellation of passive microwave
receivers that measure specular GNSS-R reflections despite clouds and smoke.
Our planner uses a Mixed Integer Program formulation to schedule joint
observation data collection and downlink for all satellites. Optimal solutions
are found quickly that collect 98-100% of available observation opportunities.
ML-based fire predictions that drive the planner objective are greater than 40%
more correlated with ground truth than existing state-of-art. The presented
case study on the TX Smokehouse Creek fire in 2024 and LA fires in 2025
represents the first high-resolution data collected by CYGNSS of active fires.
Creation of Burnt Area Maps (BAM) using ML applied to the data during active
fires and BAM assimilation into NASA's Weather Research and Forecasting Model
using ML to broadcast fire spread are novel outcomes. BAM and CYGNSS obtained
soil moisture are integrated for the first time into USGS fire danger maps.
Inclusion of CYGNSS data in ML-based burn predictions boosts accuracy by 13%,
and inclusion of high-resolution data boosts ML recall by another 15%. The
proposed workflow has an expected latency of 6-30h, improving on the current
delivery time of multiple days. All components in the proposed concept are
shown to be computationally scalable and globally generalizable, with
sustainability considerations such as edge efficiency and low latency on small
devices.

*Justin London*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ORCA-FL通过模糊逻辑控制器改进ORCA，以更好地处理路径规划中的不确定性和不精确性，实验表明其在多智能体环境中减少碰撞方面优于ORCA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有碰撞避免算法（如DWA、TEB、RVO）存在路径次优、计算成本高或动态障碍适应性不足的问题，ORCA虽改进RVO但仍需提升。

Method: 提出ORCA-FL，结合模糊逻辑控制器（FLCs）处理不确定性，并进一步通过模糊Q强化学习（FQL）优化FLCs。

Result: 实验显示，当智能体速度超过阈值时，ORCA-FL在减少碰撞方面优于ORCA。

Conclusion: ORCA-FL在多智能体环境中表现更优，未来可通过FQL进一步优化。

Abstract: Obstacle avoidance enables autonomous agents and robots to operate safely and
efficiently in dynamic and complex environments, reducing the risk of
collisions and damage. For a robot or autonomous system to successfully
navigate through obstacles, it must be able to detect such obstacles. While
numerous collision avoidance algorithms like the dynamic window approach (DWA),
timed elastic bands (TEB), and reciprocal velocity obstacles (RVO) have been
proposed, they may lead to suboptimal paths due to fixed weights, be
computationally expensive, or have limited adaptability to dynamic obstacles in
multi-agent environments. Optimal reciprocal collision avoidance (ORCA), which
improves on RVO, provides smoother trajectories and stronger collision
avoidance guarantees. We propose ORCA-FL to improve on ORCA by using fuzzy
logic controllers (FLCs) to better handle uncertainty and imprecision for
obstacle avoidance in path planning. Numerous multi-agent experiments are
conducted and it is shown that ORCA-FL can outperform ORCA in reducing the
number of collision if the agent has a velocity that exceeds a certain
threshold. In addition, a proposed algorithm for improving ORCA-FL using fuzzy
Q reinforcement learning (FQL) is detailed for optimizing and tuning FLCs.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过学习功能关系并考虑结构信息不确定性的方法，提高了机器人系统动态模型的鲁棒性，同时减少了计算资源消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型学习方法常忽略因果关系，未能利用机器人系统中交互的稀疏性，导致模型不够鲁棒且计算资源消耗高。

Method: 通过估计因果结构分布，采样因果图以指导编码器-多解码器概率模型中的潜在空间表示。

Result: 模型能学习机器人动态，结合采样规划器完成新任务，并在仿真和现实中验证了其适应性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了动态模型的鲁棒性和适应性，适用于复杂现实机器人场景。

Abstract: Structural causal models describe how the components of a robotic system
interact. They provide both structural and functional information about the
relationships that are present in the system. The structural information
outlines the variables among which there is interaction. The functional
information describes how such interactions work, via equations or learned
models. In this paper we find that learning the functional relationships while
accounting for the uncertainty about the structural information leads to more
robust dynamics models which improves downstream planning, while using
significantly lower computational resources. This in contrast with common
model-learning methods that ignore the causal structure and fail to leverage
the sparsity of interactions in robotic systems. We achieve this by estimating
a causal structure distribution that is used to sample causal graphs that
inform the latent-space representations in an encoder-multidecoder
probabilistic model. We show that our model can be used to learn the dynamics
of a robot, which together with a sampling-based planner can be used to perform
new tasks in novel environments, provided an objective function for the new
requirement is available. We validate our method using manipulators and mobile
robots in both simulation and the real-world. Additionally, we validate the
learned dynamics' adaptability and increased robustness to corrupted inputs and
changes in the environment, which is highly desirable in challenging real-world
robotics scenarios. Video: https://youtu.be/X6k5t7OOnNc.

Conclusion: 该方法为解决高维感官反馈控制中的安全问题提供了新思路，尤其在机器人手术领域具有潜力。

Abstract: Safety-critical control using high-dimensional sensory feedback from optical
data (e.g., images, point clouds) poses significant challenges in domains like
autonomous driving and robotic surgery. Control can rely on low-dimensional
states estimated from high-dimensional data. However, the estimation errors
often follow complex, unknown distributions that standard probabilistic models
fail to capture, making formal safety guarantees challenging. In this work, we
introduce a novel characterization of these general estimation errors using
sub-Gaussian noise with bounded mean. We develop a new technique for
uncertainty propagation of proposed noise characterization in linear systems,
which combines robust set-based methods with the propagation of sub-Gaussian
variance proxies. We further develop a Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework
that provides closed-loop safety guarantees for linear systems under the
proposed noise assumption. We apply this MPC approach in an
ultrasound-image-guided robotic spinal surgery pipeline, which contains
deep-learning-based semantic segmentation, image-based registration, high-level
optimization-based planning, and low-level robotic control. To validate the
pipeline, we developed a realistic simulation environment integrating real
human anatomy, robot dynamics, efficient ultrasound simulation, as well as
in-vivo data of breathing motion and drilling force. Evaluation results in
simulation demonstrate the potential of our approach for solving complex
image-guided robotic surgery task while ensuring safety.

Abstract: Bipedal robots demonstrate potential in navigating challenging terrains
through dynamic ground contact. However, current frameworks often depend solely
on proprioception or use manually designed visual pipelines, which are fragile
in real-world settings and complicate real-time footstep planning in
unstructured environments. To address this problem, we present a vision-based
hierarchical control framework that integrates a reinforcement learning
high-level footstep planner, which generates footstep commands based on a local
elevation map, with a low-level Operational Space Controller that tracks the
generated trajectories. We utilize the Angular Momentum Linear Inverted
Pendulum model to construct a low-dimensional state representation to capture
an informative encoding of the dynamics while reducing complexity. We evaluate
our method across different terrain conditions using the underactuated bipedal
robot Cassie and investigate the capabilities and challenges of our approach
through simulation and hardware experiments.

Result: 在模拟任务中实现2.2倍加速，物理机器人上1.9倍加速，且不降低成功率。

Conclusion: D3P有效平衡了性能和效率，适用于实时机器人任务。

Abstract: Diffusion policies excel at learning complex action distributions for robotic
visuomotor tasks, yet their iterative denoising process poses a major
bottleneck for real-time deployment. Existing acceleration methods apply a
fixed number of denoising steps per action, implicitly treating all actions as
equally important. However, our experiments reveal that robotic tasks often
contain a mix of \emph{crucial} and \emph{routine} actions, which differ in
their impact on task success. Motivated by this finding, we propose
\textbf{D}ynamic \textbf{D}enoising \textbf{D}iffusion \textbf{P}olicy
\textbf{(D3P)}, a diffusion-based policy that adaptively allocates denoising
steps across actions at test time. D3P uses a lightweight, state-aware adaptor
to allocate the optimal number of denoising steps for each action. We jointly
optimize the adaptor and base diffusion policy via reinforcement learning to
balance task performance and inference efficiency. On simulated tasks, D3P
achieves an averaged 2.2$\times$ inference speed-up over baselines without
degrading success. Furthermore, we demonstrate D3P's effectiveness on a
physical robot, achieving a 1.9$\times$ acceleration over the baseline.

Abstract: Precise needle alignment is essential for percutaneous needle insertion in
robotic ultrasound-guided procedures. However, inherent challenges such as
speckle noise, needle-like artifacts, and low image resolution make robust
needle detection difficult, particularly when visibility is reduced or lost. In
this paper, we propose a method to restore needle alignment when the ultrasound
imaging plane and the needle insertion plane are misaligned. Unlike many
existing approaches that rely heavily on needle visibility in ultrasound
images, our method uses a more robust feature by periodically vibrating the
needle using a mechanical system. Specifically, we propose a vibration-based
energy metric that remains effective even when the needle is fully out of
plane. Using this metric, we develop a control strategy to reposition the
ultrasound probe in response to misalignments between the imaging plane and the
needle insertion plane in both translation and rotation. Experiments conducted
on ex-vivo porcine tissue samples using a dual-arm robotic ultrasound-guided
needle insertion system demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
The experimental results show the translational error of 0.41$\pm$0.27 mm and
the rotational error of 0.51$\pm$0.19 degrees.

Conclusion: SGImagineNav通过主动预测和自适应策略，显著提升了语义导航的效率和泛化能力。

Abstract: Semantic navigation requires an agent to navigate toward a specified target
in an unseen environment. Employing an imaginative navigation strategy that
predicts future scenes before taking action, can empower the agent to find
target faster. Inspired by this idea, we propose SGImagineNav, a novel
imaginative navigation framework that leverages symbolic world modeling to
proactively build a global environmental representation. SGImagineNav maintains
an evolving hierarchical scene graphs and uses large language models to predict
and explore unseen parts of the environment. While existing methods solely
relying on past observations, this imaginative scene graph provides richer
semantic context, enabling the agent to proactively estimate target locations.
Building upon this, SGImagineNav adopts an adaptive navigation strategy that
exploits semantic shortcuts when promising and explores unknown areas otherwise
to gather additional context. This strategy continuously expands the known
environment and accumulates valuable semantic contexts, ultimately guiding the
agent toward the target. SGImagineNav is evaluated in both real-world scenarios
and simulation benchmarks. SGImagineNav consistently outperforms previous
methods, improving success rate to 65.4 and 66.8 on HM3D and HSSD, and
demonstrating cross-floor and cross-room navigation in real-world environments,
underscoring its effectiveness and generalizability.

Conclusion: EGS-SLAM显著提升了在运动模糊场景下的性能，为3D重建提供了更鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting SLAM (GS-SLAM) offers a notable improvement over
traditional SLAM methods, enabling photorealistic 3D reconstruction that
conventional approaches often struggle to achieve. However, existing GS-SLAM
systems perform poorly under persistent and severe motion blur commonly
encountered in real-world scenarios, leading to significantly degraded tracking
accuracy and compromised 3D reconstruction quality. To address this limitation,
we propose EGS-SLAM, a novel GS-SLAM framework that fuses event data with RGB-D
inputs to simultaneously reduce motion blur in images and compensate for the
sparse and discrete nature of event streams, enabling robust tracking and
high-fidelity 3D Gaussian Splatting reconstruction. Specifically, our system
explicitly models the camera's continuous trajectory during exposure,
supporting event- and blur-aware tracking and mapping on a unified 3D Gaussian
Splatting scene. Furthermore, we introduce a learnable camera response function
to align the dynamic ranges of events and images, along with a no-event loss to
suppress ringing artifacts during reconstruction. We validate our approach on a
new dataset comprising synthetic and real-world sequences with significant
motion blur. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that EGS-SLAM
consistently outperforms existing GS-SLAM systems in both trajectory accuracy
and photorealistic 3D Gaussian Splatting reconstruction. The source code will

Abstract: Embodied agents have shown promising generalization capabilities across
diverse physical environments, making them essential for a wide range of
real-world applications. However, building versatile embodied agents poses
critical challenges due to three key issues: dynamic environment perception,
open-ended tool usage, and complex multi-task planning. Most previous works
rely solely on feedback from tool agents to perceive environmental changes and
task status, which limits adaptability to real-time dynamics, causes error
accumulation, and restricts tool flexibility. Furthermore, multi-task
scheduling has received limited attention, primarily due to the inherent
complexity of managing task dependencies and balancing competing priorities in
dynamic and complex environments. To overcome these challenges, we introduce
$\mathcal{P}^3$, a unified framework that integrates real-time perception and
dynamic scheduling. Specifically, $\mathcal{P}^3$ enables 1) \textbf Perceive
relevant task information actively from the environment, 2) \textbf Plug and
utilize any tool without feedback requirement, and 3) \textbf Plan multi-task
execution based on prioritizing urgent tasks and dynamically adjusting task
order based on dependencies. Extensive real-world experiments show that our
approach bridges the gap between benchmarks and practical deployment,
delivering highly transferable, general-purpose embodied agents. Code and data
will be released soon.

Abstract: Model predictive control (MPC) is a powerful strategy for planning and
control in autonomous mobile robot navigation. However, ensuring safety in
real-world deployments remains challenging due to the presence of disturbances
and measurement noise. Existing approaches often rely on idealized assumptions,
neglect the impact of noisy measurements, and simply heuristically guess
unrealistic bounds. In this work, we present an efficient and modular robust
MPC design pipeline that systematically addresses these limitations. The
pipeline consists of an iterative procedure that leverages closed-loop
experimental data to estimate disturbance bounds and synthesize a robust
output-feedback MPC scheme. We provide the pipeline in the form of
deterministic and reproducible code to synthesize the robust output-feedback
MPC from data. We empirically demonstrate robust constraint satisfaction and
recursive feasibility in quadrotor simulations using Gazebo.

Abstract: Safe navigation in pedestrian-rich environments remains a key challenge for
autonomous robots. This work evaluates the integration of a deep learning-based
Social-Implicit (SI) pedestrian trajectory predictor within a Model Predictive
Control (MPC) framework on the physical Continental Corriere robot. Tested
across varied pedestrian densities, the SI-MPC system is compared to a
traditional Constant Velocity (CV) model in both open-loop prediction and
closed-loop navigation. Results show that SI improves trajectory prediction -
reducing errors by up to 76% in low-density settings - and enhances safety and
motion smoothness in crowded scenes. Moreover, real-world deployment reveals
discrepancies between open-loop metrics and closed-loop performance, as the SI
model yields broader, more cautious predictions. These findings emphasize the
importance of system-level evaluation and highlight the SI-MPC framework's
promise for safer, more adaptive navigation in dynamic, human-populated

algorithms fail to adequately address dynamic complexities and social
acceptance of AVs, leading to suboptimal or unsafe merging decisions. To
address this, we propose an evolutionary game-theoretic (EGT) merging
decision-making framework, grounded in the bounded rationality of human
drivers, which dynamically balances the benefits of both AVs and main-road
vehicles (MVs). We formulate the cut-in decision-making process as an EGT
problem with a multi-objective payoff function that reflects human-like driving
preferences. By solving the replicator dynamic equation for the evolutionarily
stable strategy (ESS), the optimal cut-in timing is derived, balancing
efficiency, comfort, and safety for both AVs and MVs. A real-time driving style
estimation algorithm is proposed to adjust the game payoff function online by
observing the immediate reactions of MVs. Empirical results demonstrate that we
improve the efficiency, comfort and safety of both AVs and MVs compared with
existing game-theoretic and traditional planning approaches across multi-object
metrics.

Conclusion: DexFruit框架在减少水果损伤和提高抓取成功率方面表现优异。

Abstract: DexFruit is a robotic manipulation framework that enables gentle, autonomous
handling of fragile fruit and precise evaluation of damage. Many fruits are
fragile and prone to bruising, thus requiring humans to manually harvest them
with care. In this work, we demonstrate by using optical tactile sensing,
autonomous manipulation of fruit with minimal damage can be achieved. We show
that our tactile informed diffusion policies outperform baselines in both
reduced bruising and pick-and-place success rate across three fruits:
strawberries, tomatoes, and blackberries. In addition, we introduce FruitSplat,
a novel technique to represent and quantify visual damage in high-resolution 3D
representation via 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Existing metrics for measuring
damage lack quantitative rigor or require expensive equipment. With FruitSplat,
we distill a 2D strawberry mask as well as a 2D bruise segmentation mask into
the 3DGS representation. Furthermore, this representation is modular and
general, compatible with any relevant 2D model. Overall, we demonstrate a 92%
grasping policy success rate, up to a 20% reduction in visual bruising, and up
to an 31% improvement in grasp success rate on challenging fruit compared to
our baselines across our three tested fruits. We rigorously evaluate this
result with over 630 trials. Please checkout our website at

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of novel-view synthesis and motion
reconstruction of dynamic scenes from monocular video, which is critical for
many robotic applications. Although Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have demonstrated remarkable success in rendering
static scenes, extending them to reconstruct dynamic scenes remains
challenging. In this work, we introduce a novel approach that combines 3DGS
with a motion trajectory field, enabling precise handling of complex object
motions and achieving physically plausible motion trajectories. By decoupling
dynamic objects from static background, our method compactly optimizes the
motion trajectory field. The approach incorporates time-invariant motion
coefficients and shared motion trajectory bases to capture intricate motion
patterns while minimizing optimization complexity. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results in both
novel-view synthesis and motion trajectory recovery from monocular video,
advancing the capabilities of dynamic scene reconstruction.

Abstract: Achieving fully autonomous exploration and navigation remains a critical
challenge in robotics, requiring integrated solutions for localisation,
mapping, decision-making and motion planning. Existing approaches either rely
on strict navigation rules lacking adaptability or on pre-training, which
requires large datasets. These AI methods are often computationally intensive
or based on static assumptions, limiting their adaptability in dynamic or
unknown environments. This paper introduces a bio-inspired agent based on the
Active Inference Framework (AIF), which unifies mapping, localisation, and
adaptive decision-making for autonomous navigation, including exploration and
goal-reaching. Our model creates and updates a topological map of the
environment in real-time, planning goal-directed trajectories to explore or
reach objectives without requiring pre-training. Key contributions include a
probabilistic reasoning framework for interpretable navigation, robust
adaptability to dynamic changes, and a modular ROS2 architecture compatible
with existing navigation systems. Our method was tested in simulated and
real-world environments. The agent successfully explores large-scale simulated
environments and adapts to dynamic obstacles and drift, proving to be
comparable to other exploration strategies such as Gbplanner, FAEL and
Frontiers. This approach offers a scalable and transparent approach for
navigating complex, unstructured environments.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了DLOs形状控制的挑战，代码和视频已公开。

Abstract: Manipulating deformable linear objects (DLOs) such as wires and cables is
crucial in various applications like electronics assembly and medical
surgeries. However, it faces challenges due to DLOs' infinite degrees of
freedom, complex nonlinear dynamics, and the underactuated nature of the
system. To address these issues, this paper proposes a hybrid force-position
strategy for DLO shape control. The framework, combining both force and
position representations of DLO, integrates state trajectory planning in the
force space and Model Predictive Control (MPC) in the position space. We
present a dynamics model with an explicit action encoder, a property extractor
and a graph processor based on Graph Attention Networks. The model is used in
the MPC to enhance prediction accuracy. Results from both simulations and
real-world experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in
achieving efficient and stable shape control of DLOs. Codes and videos are

Motivation: 动态和杂乱环境中机器人轨迹规划的关键挑战在于同时满足时间效率和运动平滑性，传统APF存在局部极小值和振荡问题。

Method: 提出E-APF框架，结合位置和速度依赖的势函数，并与混合轨迹优化器联合优化，最小化加加速度和执行时间。

Result: 在7自由度Kinova Gen3机器人上验证，实现了无碰撞、平滑、高效且无振荡的轨迹。

Conclusion: E-APF框架为未来反应控制策略和实际硬件部署奠定了基础。

Abstract: Robotic trajectory planning in dynamic and cluttered environments remains a
critical challenge, particularly when striving for both time efficiency and
motion smoothness under actuation constraints. Traditional path planner, such
as Artificial Potential Field (APF), offer computational efficiency but suffer
from local minima issue due to position-based potential field functions and
oscillatory motion near the obstacles due to Newtonian mechanics. To address
this limitation, an Energy-based Artificial Potential Field (APF) framework is
proposed in this paper that integrates position and velocity-dependent
potential functions. E-APF ensures dynamic adaptability and mitigates local
minima, enabling uninterrupted progression toward the goal. The proposed
framework integrates E-APF with a hybrid trajectory optimizer that jointly
minimizes jerk and execution time under velocity and acceleration constraints,
ensuring geometric smoothness and time efficiency. The entire framework is
validated in simulation using the 7-degree-of-freedom Kinova Gen3 robotic
manipulator. The results demonstrate collision-free, smooth, time-efficient,
and oscillation-free trajectory in the presence of obstacles, highlighting the
efficacy of the combined trajectory optimization and real-time obstacle
avoidance approach. This work lays the foundation for future integration with
reactive control strategies and physical hardware deployment in real-world
manipulation tasks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于学习碰撞模型的方法，通过预测最小障碍物间隙分布来改进单RGB相机在未知环境中的导航性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单RGB相机缺乏深度信息，导致在未知环境中导航时难以可靠检测碰撞。现有方法依赖噪声深度估计，效果不佳。

Method: 使用学习碰撞模型预测最小障碍物间隙分布，结合风险感知MPC规划器，通过联合训练优化模型性能。

Result: 实验显示，该方法在真实环境中的成功率比NoMaD和ROS堆栈分别提高了9倍和7倍。

Conclusion: 联合训练的学习碰撞模型显著提升了在复杂环境中的导航性能，验证了设计选择的有效性。

Abstract: Navigating unknown environments with a single RGB camera is challenging, as
the lack of depth information prevents reliable collision-checking. While some
methods use estimated depth to build collision maps, we found that depth
estimates from vision foundation models are too noisy for zero-shot navigation
in cluttered environments.
  We propose an alternative approach: instead of using noisy estimated depth
for direct collision-checking, we use it as a rich context input to a learned
collision model. This model predicts the distribution of minimum obstacle
clearance that the robot can expect for a given control sequence. At inference,
these predictions inform a risk-aware MPC planner that minimizes estimated
collision risk. Our joint learning pipeline co-trains the collision model and
risk metric using both safe and unsafe trajectories. Crucially, our
joint-training ensures optimal variance in our collision model that improves
navigation in highly cluttered environments. Consequently, real-world
experiments show 9x and 7x improvements in success rates over NoMaD and the ROS
stack, respectively. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of our
design choices.

Abstract: Agricultural robots have emerged as powerful members in agricultural tasks,
nevertheless, still heavily rely on manual operation or untransportable railway
for movement, resulting in limited mobility and poor adaptability.
Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) enables robots to navigate to the target
destinations following natural language instructions, demonstrating strong
performance on several domains. However, none of the existing benchmarks or
methods is specifically designed for agricultural scenes. To bridge this gap,
we propose Agriculture to Agriculture (A2A) benchmark, containing 1,560
episodes across six diverse agricultural scenes, in which all realistic RGB
videos are captured by front-facing camera on a quadruped robot at a height of
0.38 meters, aligning with the practical deployment conditions. Meanwhile, we
propose Vision-and-Language Navigation for Agricultural Robots (AgriVLN)
baseline based on Vision-Language Model (VLM) prompted with carefully crafted
templates, which can understand both given instructions and agricultural
environments to generate appropriate low-level actions for robot control. When
evaluated on A2A, AgriVLN performs well on short instructions but struggles
with long instructions, because it often fails to track which part of the
instruction is currently being executed. To address this, we further propose
Subtask List (STL) instruction decomposition module and integrate it into
AgriVLN, improving Success Rate (SR) from 0.33 to 0.47. We additionally compare
AgriVLN with several existing VLN methods, demonstrating the state-of-the-art
performance in the agricultural domain.

Abstract: Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to write policy code for controlling
robots has gained significant attention. However, in long-horizon implicative
tasks, this approach often results in API parameter, comments and sequencing
errors, leading to task failure. To address this problem, we propose a
collaborative Triple-S framework that involves multiple LLMs. Through
In-Context Learning, different LLMs assume specific roles in a closed-loop
Simplification-Solution-Summary process, effectively improving success rates
and robustness in long-horizon implicative tasks. Additionally, a novel
demonstration library update mechanism which learned from success allows it to
generalize to previously failed tasks. We validate the framework in the
Long-horizon Desktop Implicative Placement (LDIP) dataset across various
baseline models, where Triple-S successfully executes 89% of tasks in both
observable and partially observable scenarios. Experiments in both simulation
and real-world robot settings further validated the effectiveness of Triple-S.

Conclusion: 该框架为机器人学习人类偏好提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Equipped with Large Language Models (LLMs), human-centered robots are now
capable of performing a wide range of tasks that were previously deemed
challenging or unattainable. However, merely completing tasks is insufficient
for cognitive robots, who should learn and apply human preferences to future
scenarios. In this work, we propose a framework that combines human preferences
with physical constraints, requiring robots to complete tasks while considering
both. Firstly, we developed a benchmark of everyday household activities, which
are often evaluated based on specific preferences. We then introduced
In-Context Learning from Human Feedback (ICLHF), where human feedback comes
from direct instructions and adjustments made intentionally or unintentionally
in daily life. Extensive sets of experiments, testing the ICLHF to generate
task plans and balance physical constraints with preferences, have demonstrated

Abstract: The deployment of humanoid robots in unstructured, human-centric environments
requires navigation capabilities that extend beyond simple locomotion to
include robust perception, provable safety, and socially aware behavior.
Current reinforcement learning approaches are often limited by blind
controllers that lack environmental awareness or by vision-based systems that
fail to perceive complex 3D obstacles. In this work, we present an end-to-end
locomotion policy that directly maps raw, spatio-temporal LiDAR point clouds to
motor commands, enabling robust navigation in cluttered dynamic scenes. We
formulate the control problem as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP)
to formally separate safety from task objectives. Our key contribution is a
novel methodology that translates the principles of Control Barrier Functions
(CBFs) into costs within the CMDP, allowing a model-free Penalized Proximal
Policy Optimization (P3O) to enforce safety constraints during training.
Furthermore, we introduce a set of comfort-oriented rewards, grounded in
human-robot interaction research, to promote motions that are smooth,
predictable, and less intrusive. We demonstrate the efficacy of our framework
through a successful sim-to-real transfer to a physical humanoid robot, which
exhibits agile and safe navigation around both static and dynamic 3D obstacles.

Motivation: 现有假肢手抓取模型对未见物体表现不佳，影响用户独立性和生活质量，需提升模型泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Method: 提出Grasp-LLaVA模型进行语义推理，结合HGN实现边缘-云端协同部署，动态切换以平衡性能与延迟。

Result: Grasp-LLaVA在未见物体上准确率达50.2%，HGN进一步将准确率提升至42.3%，速度提升3.5倍。

Conclusion: Grasp-LLaVA和HGN显著提升假肢手抓取模型的泛化能力和实用性，为未来假肢控制设计提供新方向。

Abstract: For transradial amputees, robotic prosthetic hands promise to regain the
capability to perform daily living activities. To advance next-generation
prosthetic hand control design, it is crucial to address current shortcomings
in robustness to out of lab artifacts, and generalizability to new
environments. Due to the fixed number of object to interact with in existing
datasets, contrasted with the virtually infinite variety of objects encountered
in the real world, current grasp models perform poorly on unseen objects,
negatively affecting users' independence and quality of life.
  To address this: (i) we define semantic projection, the ability of a model to
generalize to unseen object types and show that conventional models like YOLO,
despite 80% training accuracy, drop to 15% on unseen objects. (ii) we propose
Grasp-LLaVA, a Grasp Vision Language Model enabling human-like reasoning to
infer the suitable grasp type estimate based on the object's physical
characteristics resulting in a significant 50.2% accuracy over unseen object
types compared to 36.7% accuracy of an SOTA grasp estimation model.
  Lastly, to bridge the performance-latency gap, we propose Hybrid Grasp
Network (HGN), an edge-cloud deployment infrastructure enabling fast grasp
estimation on edge and accurate cloud inference as a fail-safe, effectively
expanding the latency vs. accuracy Pareto. HGN with confidence calibration (DC)
enables dynamic switching between edge and cloud models, improving semantic
projection accuracy by 5.6% (to 42.3%) with 3.5x speedup over the unseen object
types. Over a real-world sample mix, it reaches 86% average accuracy (12.2%
gain over edge-only), and 2.2x faster inference than Grasp-LLaVA alone.

Motivation: 现有VLA模型在模糊语言指令和未知环境状态处理上表现不足，且感知局限于静态二维观察，缺乏三维交互建模能力。

Method: 设计了结构化思维链推理模块和实时更新的3D姿态-物体图，结合混合推理策略。

Result: 在多项真实机器人任务中，GraphCoT-VLA在任务成功率和响应速度上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GraphCoT-VLA在开放环境和不确定指令下表现出强泛化性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Vision-language-action models have emerged as a crucial paradigm in robotic
manipulation. However, existing VLA models exhibit notable limitations in
handling ambiguous language instructions and unknown environmental states.
Furthermore, their perception is largely constrained to static two-dimensional
observations, lacking the capability to model three-dimensional interactions
between the robot and its environment. To address these challenges, this paper
proposes GraphCoT-VLA, an efficient end-to-end model. To enhance the model's
ability to interpret ambiguous instructions and improve task planning, we
design a structured Chain-of-Thought reasoning module that integrates
high-level task understanding and planning, failed task feedback, and low-level
imaginative reasoning about future object positions and robot actions.
Additionally, we construct a real-time updatable 3D Pose-Object graph, which
captures the spatial configuration of robot joints and the topological
relationships between objects in 3D space, enabling the model to better
understand and manipulate their interactions. We further integrates a dropout
hybrid reasoning strategy to achieve efficient control outputs. Experimental
results across multiple real-world robotic tasks demonstrate that GraphCoT-VLA
significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of task success rate and
response speed, exhibiting strong generalization and robustness in open
environments and under uncertain instructions.

Motivation: 在通信受限的环境中，多机器人系统与人类操作者的实时交互需求被忽视，MoRoCo旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出MoRoCo框架，包含三种协调模式（spread、migrate、chain），通过分布式算法管理模式切换。

Result: 通过大规模仿真和硬件实验验证，MoRoCo在有限通信下实现了高效可靠的协调。

Conclusion: MoRoCo为复杂环境中的人机协作多机器人系统提供了鲁棒性解决方案。

Abstract: Fleets of autonomous robots are increasingly deployed alongside multiple
human operators to explore unknown environments, identify salient features, and
perform complex tasks in scenarios such as subterranean exploration,
reconnaissance, and search-and-rescue missions. In these contexts,
communication is often severely limited to short-range exchanges via ad-hoc
networks, posing challenges to coordination. While recent studies have
addressed multi-robot exploration under communication constraints, they largely
overlook the essential role of human operators and their real-time interaction
with robotic teams. Operators may demand timely updates on the exploration
progress and robot status, reprioritize or cancel tasks dynamically, or request
live video feeds and control access. Conversely, robots may seek human
confirmation for anomalous events or require help recovering from motion or
planning failures. To enable such bilateral, context-aware interactions under
restricted communication, this work proposes MoRoCo, a unified framework for
online coordination and exploration in multi-operator, multi-robot systems.
MoRoCo enables the team to adaptively switch among three coordination modes:
spread mode for parallelized exploration with intermittent data sharing,
migrate mode for coordinated relocation, and chain mode for maintaining
high-bandwidth connectivity through multi-hop links. These transitions are
managed through distributed algorithms via only local communication. Extensive
large-scale human-in-the-loop simulations and hardware experiments validate the
necessity of incorporating human robot interactions and demonstrate that MoRoCo
enables efficient, reliable coordination under limited communication, marking a
significant step toward robust human-in-the-loop multi-robot autonomy in
challenging environments.

Motivation: 现有单智能体端到端驾驶系统因遮挡和感知范围受限导致危险驾驶，且黑盒特性使其行为难以解释，缺乏可信度。

Method: 通过风险地图从驾驶数据中学习，构建多智能体时空表示，利用注意力建模环境交互，并采用基于学习的模型预测控制（MPC）模块进行规划。

Result: 在V2XPnP-Seq数据集上的评估表明，RiskMM在风险感知轨迹规划中表现优越且稳健，显著提升了框架的可解释性。

Conclusion: RiskMM通过风险地图和MPC的结合，有效解决了端到端驾驶的可解释性和协作问题，为未来研究提供了基础。

Abstract: End-to-end paradigm has emerged as a promising approach to autonomous
driving. However, existing single-agent end-to-end pipelines are often
constrained by occlusion and limited perception range, resulting in hazardous
driving. Furthermore, their black-box nature prevents the interpretability of
the driving behavior, leading to an untrustworthiness system. To address these
limitations, we introduce Risk Map as Middleware (RiskMM) and propose an
interpretable cooperative end-to-end driving framework. The risk map learns
directly from the driving data and provides an interpretable spatiotemporal
representation of the scenario from the upstream perception and the
interactions between the ego vehicle and the surrounding environment for
downstream planning. RiskMM first constructs a multi-agent spatiotemporal
representation with unified Transformer-based architecture, then derives
risk-aware representations by modeling interactions among surrounding
environments with attention. These representations are subsequently fed into a
learning-based Model Predictive Control (MPC) module. The MPC planner
inherently accommodates physical constraints and different vehicle types and
can provide interpretation by aligning learned parameters with explicit MPC
elements. Evaluations conducted on the real-world V2XPnP-Seq dataset confirm
that RiskMM achieves superior and robust performance in risk-aware trajectory
planning, significantly enhancing the interpretability of the cooperative
end-to-end driving framework. The codebase will be released to facilitate
future research in this field.

Motivation: 六足机器人在复杂地形中表现出色，但在简单地形中缺乏快速步态，限制了其广泛应用。

Method: 设计了三种控制方法：基于运动学的、模型预测的和强化学习的控制器，并在实验室和火星模拟任务中测试。

Result: LAURON VI通过快速步态策略显著提升了六足机器人在现实场景中的适用性。

Conclusion: 动态步态和自主控制技术使六足机器人更适合多样化的实际应用。

Abstract: Legged locomotion enables robotic systems to traverse extremely challenging
terrains. In many real-world scenarios, the terrain is not that difficult and
these mixed terrain types introduce the need for flexible use of different
walking strategies to achieve mission goals in a fast, reliable, and
energy-efficient way. Six-legged robots have a high degree of flexibility and
inherent stability that aids them in traversing even some of the most difficult
terrains, such as collapsed buildings. However, their lack of fast walking
gaits for easier surfaces is one reason why they are not commonly applied in
these scenarios.
  This work presents LAURON VI, a six-legged robot platform for research on
dynamic walking gaits as well as on autonomy for complex field missions. The
robot's 18 series elastic joint actuators offer high-frequency interfaces for
Cartesian impedance and pure torque control. We have designed, implemented, and
compared three control approaches: kinematic-based, model-predictive, and
reinforcement-learned controllers. The robot hardware and the different control
approaches were extensively tested in a lab environment as well as on a Mars
analog mission. The introduction of fast locomotion strategies for LAURON VI
makes six-legged robots vastly more suitable for a wide range of real-world
applications.

Motivation: 当前工业实践中，吊车载荷的精确定位依赖人工操作，效率低且风险高。

Method: 采用两种导纳传递函数，机器人基于位置的导纳控制与吊车的导纳控制协作，通过力交互实现载荷引导。

Result: 仿真与实验验证了方案的可行性。

Conclusion: 该协作方案能高效、安全地完成载荷定位任务。

Abstract: This paper presents a scheme to enhance payload manipulation using a robot
collaborating with an overhead crane. In the current industrial practice, when
the crane's payload has to be accurately manipulated and located in a desired
position, the task becomes laborious and risky since the operators have to
guide the fine motions of the payload by hand. In the proposed collaborative
scheme, the crane lifts the payload while the robot's end-effector guides it
toward the desired position. The only link between the robot and the crane is
the interaction force produced during the guiding of the payload. Two
admittance transfer functions are considered to accomplish harmless and smooth
contact with the payload. The first is used in a position-based admittance
control integrated with the robot. The second one adds compliance to the crane
by processing the interaction force through the admittance transfer function to
generate a crane's velocity command that makes the crane follow the payload.
Then the robot's end-effector and the crane move collaboratively to guide the
payload to the desired location. A method is presented to design the admittance
controllers that accomplish a fluent robot-crane collaboration. Simulations and
experiments validating the scheme potential are shown.

Motivation: 随着物流需求增长，无人机与地面机器人协同工作成为趋势，但无人机受限于电池、负载和飞行时间，需地面支持。

Method: SwarmVLM利用VLM和RAG技术动态调整阻抗控制参数，无人机通过APF规划实时导航，地面机器人通过虚拟阻抗链接跟随并避障。

Result: 实验成功率92%，VLM-RAG在理想光照下物体检测和参数选择准确率8%，地面机器人避障时横向偏差达50cm。

Conclusion: SwarmVLM展示了在复杂环境中安全导航的能力，为异构机器人协作提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: With the growing demand for efficient logistics, unmanned aerial vehicles
(UAVs) are increasingly being paired with automated guided vehicles (AGVs).
While UAVs offer the ability to navigate through dense environments and varying
altitudes, they are limited by battery life, payload capacity, and flight
duration, necessitating coordinated ground support.
  Focusing on heterogeneous navigation, SwarmVLM addresses these limitations by
enabling semantic collaboration between UAVs and ground robots through
impedance control. The system leverages the Vision Language Model (VLM) and the
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to adjust impedance control parameters in
response to environmental changes. In this framework, the UAV acts as a leader
using Artificial Potential Field (APF) planning for real-time navigation, while
the ground robot follows via virtual impedance links with adaptive link
topology to avoid collisions with short obstacles.
  The system demonstrated a 92% success rate across 12 real-world trials. Under
optimal lighting conditions, the VLM-RAG framework achieved 8% accuracy in
object detection and selection of impedance parameters. The mobile robot
prioritized short obstacle avoidance, occasionally resulting in a lateral
deviation of up to 50 cm from the UAV path, which showcases safe navigation in
a cluttered setting.

Method: 开发了一个包含25个振动电机和音频播放的多模态系统，通过实验让32名中国参与者评估不同刺激的情感表达效果。

Result: 多模态组合显著提高情感解码准确性；触觉和听觉各自对某些情感识别有优势；手势单独表达情感效果较差。

Conclusion: 多感官整合在情感人机交互中至关重要，触觉和听觉线索在情感表达中具有互补作用。

Abstract: Affective tactile interaction constitutes a fundamental component of human
communication. In natural human-human encounters, touch is seldom experienced
in isolation; rather, it is inherently multisensory. Individuals not only
perceive the physical sensation of touch but also register the accompanying
auditory cues generated through contact. The integration of haptic and auditory
information forms a rich and nuanced channel for emotional expression. While
extensive research has examined how robots convey emotions through facial
expressions and speech, their capacity to communicate social gestures and
emotions via touch remains largely underexplored. To address this gap, we
developed a multimodal interaction system incorporating a 5*5 grid of 25
vibration motors synchronized with audio playback, enabling robots to deliver
combined haptic-audio stimuli. In an experiment involving 32 Chinese
participants, ten emotions and six social gestures were presented through
vibration, sound, or their combination. Participants rated each stimulus on
arousal and valence scales. The results revealed that (1) the combined
haptic-audio modality significantly enhanced decoding accuracy compared to
single modalities; (2) each individual channel-vibration or sound-effectively
supported certain emotions recognition, with distinct advantages depending on
the emotional expression; and (3) gestures alone were generally insufficient
for conveying clearly distinguishable emotions. These findings underscore the
importance of multisensory integration in affective human-robot interaction and
highlight the complementary roles of haptic and auditory cues in enhancing
emotional communication.

Conclusion: DETACH通过生物启发的双流解耦机制，有效解决了跨领域长时程任务的泛化问题。

Abstract: Long-Horizon (LH) tasks in Human-Scene Interaction (HSI) are complex
multi-step tasks that require continuous planning, sequential decision-making,
and extended execution across domains to achieve the final goal. However,
existing methods heavily rely on skill chaining by concatenating pre-trained
subtasks, with environment observations and self-state tightly coupled, lacking
the ability to generalize to new combinations of environments and skills,
failing to complete various LH tasks across domains. To solve this problem,
this paper presents DETACH, a cross-domain learning framework for LH tasks via
biologically inspired dual-stream disentanglement. Inspired by the brain's
"where-what" dual pathway mechanism, DETACH comprises two core modules: i) an
environment learning module for spatial understanding, which captures object
functions, spatial relationships, and scene semantics, achieving cross-domain
transfer through complete environment-self disentanglement; ii) a skill
learning module for task execution, which processes self-state information
including joint degrees of freedom and motor patterns, enabling cross-skill
transfer through independent motor pattern encoding. We conducted extensive
experiments on various LH tasks in HSI scenes. Compared with existing methods,
DETACH can achieve an average subtasks success rate improvement of 23% and
average execution efficiency improvement of 29%.

context-aware decision-making. A virtual safety envelope, enforced by
calibrated sensor offsets, ensures collision avoidance, while a multithreaded

facilitated by 3D bounding box estimation with Kalman filtering. Experimental
results in an indoor testbed demonstrate strong performance, with object

Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 7.2 cm, only 16 safety envelope breaches across 42

Abstract: Reasoning is central to purposeful action, yet most robotic foundation models
map perception and instructions directly to control, which limits adaptability,
generalization, and semantic grounding. We introduce Action Reasoning Models
(ARMs), a class of vision-language-action models that integrate perception,
planning, and control through a structured three-stage pipeline. Our model,
MolmoAct, encodes observations and instructions into depth-aware perception
tokens, generates mid-level spatial plans as editable trajectory traces, and
predicts precise low-level actions, enabling explainable and steerable
behavior. MolmoAct-7B-D achieves strong performance across simulation and
real-world settings: 70.5% zero-shot accuracy on SimplerEnv Visual Matching
tasks, surpassing closed-source Pi-0 and GR00T N1; 86.6% average success on
LIBERO, including an additional 6.3% gain over ThinkAct on long-horizon tasks;
and in real-world fine-tuning, an additional 10% (single-arm) and an additional
22.7% (bimanual) task progression over Pi-0-FAST. It also outperforms baselines
by an additional 23.3% on out-of-distribution generalization and achieves top
human-preference scores for open-ended instruction following and trajectory
steering. Furthermore, we release, for the first time, the MolmoAct Dataset --
a mid-training robot dataset comprising over 10,000 high quality robot
trajectories across diverse scenarios and tasks. Training with this dataset
yields an average 5.5% improvement in general performance over the base model.
We release all model weights, training code, our collected dataset, and our
action reasoning dataset, establishing MolmoAct as both a state-of-the-art
robotics foundation model and an open blueprint for building ARMs that
transform perception into purposeful action through structured reasoning.

Conclusion: PCHands为跨形态机械手的通用表示学习提供了有效解决方案，并在实际实验中验证了其性能。

Abstract: We consider the problem of learning a common representation for dexterous
manipulation across manipulators of different morphologies. To this end, we
propose PCHands, a novel approach for extracting hand postural synergies from a
large set of manipulators. We define a simplified and unified description
format based on anchor positions for manipulators ranging from 2-finger
grippers to 5-finger anthropomorphic hands. This enables learning a
variable-length latent representation of the manipulator configuration and the
alignment of the end-effector frame of all manipulators. We show that it is
possible to extract principal components from this latent representation that
is universal across manipulators of different structures and degrees of
freedom. To evaluate PCHands, we use this compact representation to encode
observation and action spaces of control policies for dexterous manipulation
tasks learned with RL. In terms of learning efficiency and consistency, the
proposed representation outperforms a baseline that learns the same tasks in
joint space. We additionally show that PCHands performs robustly in RL from
demonstration, when demonstrations are provided from a different manipulator.
We further support our results with real-world experiments that involve a
2-finger gripper and a 4-finger anthropomorphic hand. Code and additional
material are available at https://hsp-iit.github.io/PCHands/.

Conclusion: 该方法在非合作目标拦截中表现出高效性和稳定性，适用于实际无人机任务。

Abstract: This paper proposes a strategy to encircle and intercept a non-cooperative
aerial point-mass moving target by leveraging noisy range measurements for
state estimation. In this approach, the guardians actively ensure the
observability of the target by using an anti-synchronization (AS), 3D
``vibrating string" trajectory, which enables rapid position and velocity
estimation based on the Kalman filter. Additionally, a novel anti-target
controller is designed for the guardians to enable adaptive transitions from
encircling a protected target to encircling, intercepting, and neutralizing a
hostile target, taking into consideration the input constraints of the
guardians. Based on the guaranteed uniform observability, the exponentially
bounded stability of the state estimation error and the convergence of the
encirclement error are rigorously analyzed. Simulation results and real-world
UAV experiments are presented to further validate the effectiveness of the
system design.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于翻覆感知的轨迹规划器（CAP），用于在崎岖地形上实现安全高效的导航。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地面机器人在复杂环境中自主导航时面临翻覆风险，需平衡安全与效率。

Method: 分析机器人翻覆稳定性，定义可通行方向，并将其作为约束条件用于轨迹优化，采用图求解器生成轨迹。

Result: 仿真和实验验证了CAP的优越性，其性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CAP在崎岖地形上实现了更安全、高效的导航。

Abstract: It is a challenging task for ground robots to autonomously navigate in harsh
environments due to the presence of non-trivial obstacles and uneven terrain.
This requires trajectory planning that balances safety and efficiency. The
primary challenge is to generate a feasible trajectory that prevents robot from
tip-over while ensuring effective navigation. In this paper, we propose a
capsizing-aware trajectory planner (CAP) to achieve trajectory planning on the
uneven terrain. The tip-over stability of the robot on rough terrain is
analyzed. Based on the tip-over stability, we define the traversable
orientation, which indicates the safe range of robot orientations. This
orientation is then incorporated into a capsizing-safety constraint for
trajectory optimization. We employ a graph-based solver to compute a robust and
feasible trajectory while adhering to the capsizing-safety constraint.
Extensive simulation and real-world experiments validate the effectiveness and
robustness of the proposed method. The results demonstrate that CAP outperforms
existing state-of-the-art approaches, providing enhanced navigation performance
on uneven terrains.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: AimBot是一种轻量级视觉增强技术，通过在多视角RGB图像上叠加辅助视觉引导（如射击线和瞄准镜），显式编码末端执行器的状态，从而提升机器人操作的视觉运动策略学习效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉运动策略学习在机器人操作中缺乏显式的空间线索，导致学习效率低下。AimBot旨在通过提供空间视觉反馈来改善这一问题。

Method: AimBot利用深度图像、相机外参和末端执行器姿态计算叠加的视觉引导（如射击线和瞄准镜），并将其覆盖到RGB图像上，无需改变模型架构。

Result: 实验表明，AimBot在仿真和真实环境中均能显著提升多种视觉运动策略的性能，且计算开销极低（小于1毫秒）。

Conclusion: AimBot通过提供空间视觉反馈，简单高效地提升了机器人操作的视觉运动策略学习效果。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose AimBot, a lightweight visual augmentation technique
that provides explicit spatial cues to improve visuomotor policy learning in
robotic manipulation. AimBot overlays shooting lines and scope reticles onto
multi-view RGB images, offering auxiliary visual guidance that encodes the
end-effector's state. The overlays are computed from depth images, camera
extrinsics, and the current end-effector pose, explicitly conveying spatial
relationships between the gripper and objects in the scene. AimBot incurs
minimal computational overhead (less than 1 ms) and requires no changes to
model architectures, as it simply replaces original RGB images with augmented
counterparts. Despite its simplicity, our results show that AimBot consistently
improves the performance of various visuomotor policies in both simulation and
real-world settings, highlighting the benefits of spatially grounded visual
feedback.

Conclusion: 提供了一种原则性框架，为资源受限环境中的压缩神经网络控制器部署提供了理论和实践支持。

Abstract: The rapid growth of resource-constrained mobile platforms, including mobile
robots, wearable systems, and Internet-of-Things devices, has increased the
demand for computationally efficient neural network controllers (NNCs) that can
operate within strict hardware limitations. While deep neural networks (DNNs)
demonstrate superior performance in control applications, their substantial
computational complexity and memory requirements present significant barriers
to practical deployment on edge devices. This paper introduces a comprehensive
model compression methodology that leverages component-aware structured pruning
to determine the optimal pruning magnitude for each pruning group, ensuring a
balance between compression and stability for NNC deployment. Our approach is
rigorously evaluated on Temporal Difference Model Predictive Control (TD-MPC),
a state-of-the-art model-based reinforcement learning algorithm, with a
systematic integration of mathematical stability guarantee properties,
specifically Lyapunov criteria. The key contribution of this work lies in
providing a principled framework for determining the theoretical limits of
model compression while preserving controller stability. Experimental
validation demonstrates that our methodology successfully reduces model
complexity while maintaining requisite control performance and stability
characteristics. Furthermore, our approach establishes a quantitative boundary
for safe compression ratios, enabling practitioners to systematically determine
the maximum permissible model reduction before violating critical stability
properties, thereby facilitating the confident deployment of compressed NNCs in
resource-limited environments.

Abstract: Off-road navigation is an important capability for mobile robots deployed in
environments that are inaccessible or dangerous to humans, such as disaster

repeatable benchmark environment, Verti-Arena supports reproducible experiments
across a variety of vertically challenging terrains and provides precise ground
truth measurements through onboard sensors and a motion capture system.
Verti-Arena also supports consistent data collection and comparative evaluation
of algorithms in off-road autonomy research. We also develop a web-based
interface that enables research groups worldwide to remotely conduct
standardized off-road autonomy experiments on Verti-Arena.

Abstract: Language-guided long-horizon mobile manipulation has long been a grand
challenge in embodied semantic reasoning, generalizable manipulation, and
adaptive locomotion. Three fundamental limitations hinder progress: First,
although large language models have improved spatial reasoning and task
planning through semantic priors, existing implementations remain confined to
tabletop scenarios, failing to address the constrained perception and limited
actuation ranges of mobile platforms. Second, current manipulation strategies
exhibit insufficient generalization when confronted with the diverse object
configurations encountered in open-world environments. Third, while crucial for
practical deployment, the dual requirement of maintaining high platform
maneuverability alongside precise end-effector control in unstructured settings
remains understudied.
  In this work, we present ODYSSEY, a unified mobile manipulation framework for
agile quadruped robots equipped with manipulators, which seamlessly integrates
high-level task planning with low-level whole-body control. To address the
challenge of egocentric perception in language-conditioned tasks, we introduce
a hierarchical planner powered by a vision-language model, enabling
long-horizon instruction decomposition and precise action execution. At the
control level, our novel whole-body policy achieves robust coordination across
challenging terrains. We further present the first benchmark for long-horizon
mobile manipulation, evaluating diverse indoor and outdoor scenarios. Through
successful sim-to-real transfer, we demonstrate the system's generalization and
robustness in real-world deployments, underscoring the practicality of legged
manipulators in unstructured environments. Our work advances the feasibility of
generalized robotic assistants capable of complex, dynamic tasks. Our project

Conclusion: BeyondMimic填补了运动跟踪和动作原语学习的空白，为人形机器人控制提供了灵活且自然的解决方案。

Abstract: Learning skills from human motions offers a promising path toward
generalizable policies for whole-body humanoid control, yet two key
cornerstones are missing: (1) a high-quality motion tracking framework that
faithfully transforms large-scale kinematic references into robust and
extremely dynamic motions on real hardware, and (2) a distillation approach
that can effectively learn these motion primitives and compose them to solve
downstream tasks. We address these gaps with BeyondMimic, the first real-world
framework to learn from human motions for versatile and naturalistic humanoid
control via guided diffusion. Our framework provides a motion tracking pipeline
capable of challenging skills such as jumping spins, sprinting, and cartwheels
with state-of-the-art motion quality. Moving beyond mimicking existing motions
and synthesize novel ones, we further introduce a unified diffusion policy that
enables zero-shot task-specific control at test time using simple cost
functions. Deployed on hardware, BeyondMimic performs diverse tasks at test
time, including waypoint navigation, joystick teleoperation, and obstacle
avoidance, bridging sim-to-real motion tracking and flexible synthesis of human
motion primitives for whole-body control. https://beyondmimic.github.io/.

Motivation: 传统BRDF模型依赖复杂的解析推导，且忽略空间变化，PureSample旨在通过神经网络简化这一过程。

Method: 使用流匹配神经网络建模采样分布，并引入轻量级神经网络捕获视图相关反照率，实现高效采样和BRDF评估。

Result: PureSample成功应用于多层材料、多次散射微表面材料等多种复杂材料。

Conclusion: PureSample提供了一种更简单、高效的方法来建模和评估BRDF，适用于均匀和非均匀材料。

Abstract: Traditional physically-based material models rely on analytically derived
bidirectional reflectance distribution functions (BRDFs), typically by
considering statistics of micro-primitives such as facets, flakes, or spheres,
sometimes combined with multi-bounce interactions such as layering and multiple
scattering. These derivations are often complex and model-specific, and
typically consider a statistical aggregate of a large surface area, ignoring
spatial variation. Once an analytic BRDF's evaluation is defined, one still
needs to design an importance sampling method for it, and a way to evaluate the
pdf of that sampling distribution, requiring further model-specific
derivations.
  We present PureSample: a novel neural BRDF representation that allows
learning a material's behavior purely by sampling forward random walks on the
microgeometry, which is usually straightforward to implement. Our
representation allows for efficient importance sampling, pdf evaluation, and
BRDF evaluation, for homogeneous as well as spatially varying materials.
  We achieve this by two learnable components: first, the sampling distribution
is modeled using a flow matching neural network, which allows both importance
sampling and pdf evaluation; second, we introduce a view-dependent albedo term,
captured by a lightweight neural network, which allows for converting a scalar
pdf value to a colored BRDF value for any pair of view and light directions.
  We demonstrate PureSample on challenging materials, including multi-layered
materials, multiple-scattering microfacet materials, and various other
microstructures.

Abstract: The criteria for determining graph isomorphism are crucial for solving graph
isomorphism problems. The necessary condition is that two isomorphic graphs
possess invariants, but their function can only be used to filtrate and
subdivide candidate spaces. The sufficient conditions are used to rebuild the
isomorphic reconstruction of special graphs, but their drawback is that the
isomorphic functions of subgraphs may not form part of the isomorphic functions
of the parent graph. The use of sufficient or necessary conditions generally
results in backtracking to ensure the correctness of the decision algorithm.
The sufficient and necessary conditions can ensure that the determination of
graph isomorphism does not require backtracking, but the correctness of its
proof process is difficult to guarantee. This article proposes a verification
method that can correctly determine whether the judgment conditions proposed by
previous researchers are sufficient and necessary conditions. A subdivision
method has also been proposed in this article, which can obtain more
subdivisions for necessary conditions and effectively reduce the size of
backtracking space.

Abstract: Recent research on learnable neural representations has been widely adopted
in the field of 3D scene reconstruction and neural rendering applications.
However, traditional feature grid representations often suffer from substantial
memory footprint, posing a significant bottleneck for modern parallel computing
hardware. In this paper, we present neural vertex features, a generalized
formulation of learnable representation for neural rendering tasks involving
explicit mesh surfaces. Instead of uniformly distributing neural features
throughout 3D space, our method stores learnable features directly at mesh
vertices, leveraging the underlying geometry as a compact and structured
representation for neural processing. This not only optimizes memory
efficiency, but also improves feature representation by aligning compactly with
the surface using task-specific geometric priors. We validate our neural
representation across diverse neural rendering tasks, with a specific emphasis
on neural radiosity. Experimental results demonstrate that our method reduces
memory consumption to only one-fifth (or even less) of grid-based
representations, while maintaining comparable rendering quality and lowering
inference overhead.

Abstract: The ability to engineer complex three-dimensional shapes from planar sheets
with precise, programmable control underpins emerging technologies in soft
robotics, reconfigurable devices, and functional materials. Here, we present a
reduced-order numerical and experimental framework for a bilayer system
consisting of a stimuli-responsive thermoplastic sheet (Shrinky Dink) bonded to
a kirigami-patterned, inert plastic layer. Upon uniform heating, the active
layer contracts while the patterned layer constrains in-plane stretch but
allows out-of-plane bending, yielding programmable 3D morphologies from simple
planar precursors. Our approach enables efficient computational design and
scalable manufacturing of 3D forms with a single-layer reduced model that
captures the coupled mechanics of stretching and bending. Unlike traditional
bilayer modeling, our framework collapses the multilayer composite into a
single layer of nodes and elements, reducing the degrees of freedom and
enabling simulation on a 2D geometry. This is achieved by introducing a novel
energy formulation that captures the coupling between in-plane stretch mismatch
and out-of-plane bending - extending beyond simple isotropic linear elastic
models. Experimentally, we establish a fully planar, repeatable fabrication
protocol using a stimuli-responsive thermoplastic and a laser-cut inert plastic
layer. The programmed strain mismatch drives an array of 3D morphologies, such
as bowls, canoes, and flower petals, all verified by both simulation and
physical prototypes.

Abstract: We present LL3M, a multi-agent system that leverages pretrained large
language models (LLMs) to generate 3D assets by writing interpretable Python
code in Blender. We break away from the typical generative approach that learns
from a collection of 3D data. Instead, we reformulate shape generation as a
code-writing task, enabling greater modularity, editability, and integration
with artist workflows. Given a text prompt, LL3M coordinates a team of
specialized LLM agents to plan, retrieve, write, debug, and refine Blender
scripts that generate and edit geometry and appearance. The generated code
works as a high-level, interpretable, human-readable, well-documented
representation of scenes and objects, making full use of sophisticated Blender
constructs (e.g. B-meshes, geometry modifiers, shader nodes) for diverse,
unconstrained shapes, materials, and scenes. This code presents many avenues
for further agent and human editing and experimentation via code tweaks or
procedural parameters. This medium naturally enables a co-creative loop in our
system: agents can automatically self-critique using code and visuals, while
iterative user instructions provide an intuitive way to refine assets. A shared
code context across agents enables awareness of previous attempts, and a
retrieval-augmented generation knowledge base built from Blender API
documentation, BlenderRAG, equips agents with examples, types, and functions
empowering advanced modeling operations and code correctness. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of LL3M across diverse shape categories, style and material
edits, and user-driven refinements. Our experiments showcase the power of code
as a generative and interpretable medium for 3D asset creation. Our project
