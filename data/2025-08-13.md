Abstract: Addressing plant diseases and pests is critical for enhancing crop production
and preventing economic losses. Recent advances in artificial intelligence
(AI), machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) have significantly improved
the precision and efficiency of detection methods, surpassing the limitations
of manual identification. This study reviews modern computer-based techniques
for detecting plant diseases and pests from images, including recent AI
developments. The methodologies are organized into five categories:
hyperspectral imaging, non-visualization techniques, visualization approaches,
modified deep learning architectures, and transformer models. This structured
taxonomy provides researchers with detailed, actionable insights for selecting
advanced state-of-the-art detection methods. A comprehensive survey of recent
work and comparative studies demonstrates the consistent superiority of modern
AI-based approaches, which often outperform older image analysis methods in
speed and accuracy. In particular, vision transformers such as the Hierarchical
Vision Transformer (HvT) have shown accuracy exceeding 99.3% in plant disease
detection, outperforming architectures like MobileNetV3. The study concludes by
discussing system design challenges, proposing solutions, and outlining
promising directions for future research.

### [2] [ImageDDI: Image-enhanced Molecular Motif Sequence Representation for Drug-Drug Interaction Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08338)
*Yuqin He,Tengfei Ma,Chaoyi Li,Pengsen Ma,Hongxin Xiang,Jianmin Wang,Yiping Liu,Bosheng Song,Xiangxiang Zeng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ImageDDI提出了一种结合分子图像和功能基序序列的框架，用于预测药物相互作用（DDI），通过全局和局部结构表示提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在药物相互作用预测中受限于功能基序表示学习不足，而DDI主要由基序相互作用引起。

Method: ImageDDI将分子分解为功能基序，通过Transformer编码器嵌入序列，并结合分子图像信息增强空间表示。

Result: 实验表明ImageDDI在多个数据集上优于现有方法，且在2D和3D图像增强场景中表现优异。

Conclusion: ImageDDI通过融合分子图像和基序序列，显著提升了DDI预测的准确性和泛化能力。

Abstract: To mitigate the potential adverse health effects of simultaneous multi-drug
use, including unexpected side effects and interactions, accurately identifying
and predicting drug-drug interactions (DDIs) is considered a crucial task in
the field of deep learning. Although existing methods have demonstrated
promising performance, they suffer from the bottleneck of limited functional
motif-based representation learning, as DDIs are fundamentally caused by motif
interactions rather than the overall drug structures. In this paper, we propose
an Image-enhanced molecular motif sequence representation framework for
\textbf{DDI} prediction, called ImageDDI, which represents a pair of drugs from
both global and local structures. Specifically, ImageDDI tokenizes molecules
into functional motifs. To effectively represent a drug pair, their motifs are
combined into a single sequence and embedded using a transformer-based encoder,
starting from the local structure representation. By leveraging the
associations between drug pairs, ImageDDI further enhances the spatial
representation of molecules using global molecular image information (e.g.
texture, shadow, color, and planar spatial relationships). To integrate
molecular visual information into functional motif sequence, ImageDDI employs
Adaptive Feature Fusion, enhancing the generalization of ImageDDI by
dynamically adapting the fusion process of feature representations.
Experimental results on widely used datasets demonstrate that ImageDDI
outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, extensive experiments show that
ImageDDI achieved competitive performance in both 2D and 3D image-enhanced
scenarios compared to other models.

### [3] [Designing Object Detection Models for TinyML: Foundations, Comparative Analysis, Challenges, and Emerging Solutions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08352)

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着物联网设备的快速增长（预计2030年超过1500亿台），资源受限设备上部署目标检测模型的需求日益迫切，但现有研究未充分解决优化挑战。

Method: 论文详细分析了量化、剪枝、知识蒸馏和神经架构搜索等优化技术，并探讨了理论与实际实现的结合。

Abstract: Object detection (OD) has become vital for numerous computer vision
applications, but deploying it on resource-constrained IoT devices presents a
significant challenge. These devices, often powered by energy-efficient
microcontrollers, struggle to handle the computational load of deep
learning-based OD models. This issue is compounded by the rapid proliferation
of IoT devices, predicted to surpass 150 billion by 2030. TinyML offers a
compelling solution by enabling OD on ultra-low-power devices, paving the way
for efficient and real-time processing at the edge. Although numerous survey
papers have been published on this topic, they often overlook the optimization
challenges associated with deploying OD models in TinyML environments. To
address this gap, this survey paper provides a detailed analysis of key
optimization techniques for deploying OD models on resource-constrained
devices. These techniques include quantization, pruning, knowledge
distillation, and neural architecture search. Furthermore, we explore both
theoretical approaches and practical implementations, bridging the gap between
academic research and real-world edge artificial intelligence deployment.
Finally, we compare the key performance indicators (KPIs) of existing OD
implementations on microcontroller devices, highlighting the achieved maturity
level of these solutions in terms of both prediction accuracy and efficiency.
We also provide a public repository to continually track developments in this
fast-evolving field:

### [4] [Neural Tangent Knowledge Distillation for Optical Convolutional Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08421)
*Jinlin Xiang,Minho Choi,Yubo Zhang,Zhihao Zhou,Arka Majumdar,Eli Shlizerman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种任务无关和硬件无关的管道，用于优化混合光学神经网络（ONNs）的性能，包括训练前系统设计、训练中的知识蒸馏和制造后的微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 混合光学神经网络（ONNs）在实时、功耗受限系统中具有能效优势，但存在精度差距和仿真与制造差异的问题，限制了其应用。

Method: 提出任务无关和硬件无关的管道，包括系统设计前的精度估计、训练中的神经切线知识蒸馏（NTKD）和制造后的数字后端微调。

Result: 在多个数据集和硬件配置上验证，管道显著提升了ONNs的性能，支持仿真和实际部署。

Conclusion: 该管道为ONNs的广泛应用提供了实用解决方案，缩小了精度差距并提升了系统适应性。

Abstract: Hybrid Optical Neural Networks (ONNs, typically consisting of an optical
frontend and a digital backend) offer an energy-efficient alternative to fully
digital deep networks for real-time, power-constrained systems. However, their
adoption is limited by two main challenges: the accuracy gap compared to
large-scale networks during training, and discrepancies between simulated and
fabricated systems that further degrade accuracy. While previous work has
proposed end-to-end optimizations for specific datasets (e.g., MNIST) and
optical systems, these approaches typically lack generalization across tasks
and hardware designs. To address these limitations, we propose a task-agnostic
and hardware-agnostic pipeline that supports image classification and
segmentation across diverse optical systems. To assist optical system design
before training, we estimate achievable model accuracy based on user-specified
constraints such as physical size and the dataset. For training, we introduce
Neural Tangent Knowledge Distillation (NTKD), which aligns optical models with
electronic teacher networks, thereby narrowing the accuracy gap. After
fabrication, NTKD also guides fine-tuning of the digital backend to compensate
for implementation errors. Experiments on multiple datasets (e.g., MNIST,
CIFAR, Carvana Masking) and hardware configurations show that our pipeline
consistently improves ONN performance and enables practical deployment in both
pre-fabrication simulations and physical implementations.

### [5] [MAViS: A Multi-Agent Framework for Long-Sequence Video Storytelling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08487)
*Qian Wang,Ziqi Huang,Ruoxi Jia,Paul Debevec,Ning Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAViS是一个多智能体协作框架，用于生成长序列视频故事，通过分阶段协作和3E原则提升视频质量、辅助能力和表现力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前长序列视频生成框架存在辅助能力差、视觉质量不佳和表现力有限的问题，MAViS旨在解决这些限制。

Method: MAViS采用多智能体协作框架，分阶段处理脚本编写、镜头设计、角色建模等任务，并遵循3E原则（探索、检查、增强）。

Result: 实验表明，MAViS在辅助能力、视觉质量和表现力上达到最优性能，并能与多种生成模型和工具兼容。

Conclusion: MAViS是首个提供多模态设计输出的框架，能够通过简短用户提示生成高质量的长序列视频故事。

Abstract: Despite recent advances, long-sequence video generation frameworks still
suffer from significant limitations: poor assistive capability, suboptimal
visual quality, and limited expressiveness. To mitigate these limitations, we
propose MAViS, an end-to-end multi-agent collaborative framework for
long-sequence video storytelling. MAViS orchestrates specialized agents across
multiple stages, including script writing, shot designing, character modeling,
keyframe generation, video animation, and audio generation. In each stage,
agents operate under the 3E Principle -- Explore, Examine, and Enhance -- to
ensure the completeness of intermediate outputs. Considering the capability
limitations of current generative models, we propose the Script Writing
Guidelines to optimize compatibility between scripts and generative tools.
Experimental results demonstrate that MAViS achieves state-of-the-art
performance in assistive capability, visual quality, and video expressiveness.
Its modular framework further enables scalability with diverse generative
models and tools. With just a brief user prompt, MAViS is capable of producing
high-quality, expressive long-sequence video storytelling, enriching
inspirations and creativity for users. To the best of our knowledge, MAViS is
the only framework that provides multimodal design output -- videos with
narratives and background music.

### [6] [MuGa-VTON: Multi-Garment Virtual Try-On via Diffusion Transformers with Prompt Customization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08488)
*Ankan Deria,Dwarikanath Mahapatra,Behzad Bozorgtabar,Mohna Chakraborty,Snehashis Chakraborty,Sudipta Roy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MuGa-VTON是一个统一的多服装扩散框架，通过联合建模上下服装和个人身份，解决了现有虚拟试衣方法在身份保留和服装保真度上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有虚拟试衣方法通常分开处理上下服装，依赖复杂预处理，且难以保留个人特征（如纹身、配饰和体型），导致真实感和灵活性受限。

Method: 提出三个关键模块：服装表示模块（GRM）捕捉服装语义，个人表示模块（PRM）编码身份和姿势线索，A-DiT融合模块通过扩散变压器整合服装、个人和文本提示特征。

Result: 在VITON-HD和DressCode基准测试中，MuGa-VTON在定性和定量评估上均优于现有方法，生成高保真且保留身份的结果。

Conclusion: MuGa-VTON为虚拟试衣提供了更真实、灵活的解决方案，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Virtual try-on seeks to generate photorealistic images of individuals in
desired garments, a task that must simultaneously preserve personal identity
and garment fidelity for practical use in fashion retail and personalization.
However, existing methods typically handle upper and lower garments separately,
rely on heavy preprocessing, and often fail to preserve person-specific cues
such as tattoos, accessories, and body shape-resulting in limited realism and
flexibility. To this end, we introduce MuGa-VTON, a unified multi-garment
diffusion framework that jointly models upper and lower garments together with
person identity in a shared latent space. Specifically, we proposed three key
modules: the Garment Representation Module (GRM) for capturing both garment
semantics, the Person Representation Module (PRM) for encoding identity and
pose cues, and the A-DiT fusion module, which integrates garment, person, and
text-prompt features through a diffusion transformer. This architecture
supports prompt-based customization, allowing fine-grained garment
modifications with minimal user input. Extensive experiments on the VITON-HD
and DressCode benchmarks demonstrate that MuGa-VTON outperforms existing
methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, producing
high-fidelity, identity-preserving results suitable for real-world virtual
try-on applications.

### [7] [CObL: Toward Zero-Shot Ordinal Layering without User Prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08498)
*Aneel Damaraju,Dean Hazineh,Todd Zickler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CObL的扩散架构，用于从图像中推断出由遮挡有序的物体层组成的场景表示，能够零样本泛化到真实世界场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉任务需要将像素分组为物体并理解其空间关系，包括遮挡和深度。现有方法在无监督物体表示学习和多物体重建方面存在局限性。

Method: 使用基于扩散的CObL架构，并行生成物体层，利用Stable Diffusion作为先验，并通过推理时指导确保层复合回输入图像。

Result: CObL在合成图像上训练后，能够零样本泛化到真实世界场景，无需用户提示或预先知道物体数量。

Conclusion: CObL在无监督多物体重建和泛化能力上优于现有方法，展示了其在实际应用中的潜力。

Abstract: Vision benefits from grouping pixels into objects and understanding their
spatial relationships, both laterally and in depth. We capture this with a
scene representation comprising an occlusion-ordered stack of "object layers,"
each containing an isolated and amodally-completed object. To infer this
representation from an image, we introduce a diffusion-based architecture named
Concurrent Object Layers (CObL). CObL generates a stack of object layers in
parallel, using Stable Diffusion as a prior for natural objects and
inference-time guidance to ensure the inferred layers composite back to the
input image. We train CObL using a few thousand synthetically-generated images
of multi-object tabletop scenes, and we find that it zero-shot generalizes to
photographs of real-world tabletops with varying numbers of novel objects. In
contrast to recent models for amodal object completion, CObL reconstructs
multiple occluded objects without user prompting and without knowing the number
of objects beforehand. Unlike previous models for unsupervised object-centric
representation learning, CObL is not limited to the world it was trained in.

*Aaditya Baranwal,Madhav Kataria,Naitik Agrawal,Yogesh S Rawat,Shruti Vyas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 当前视觉语言模型（VLMs）在时序视觉叙事中存在表层识别与深层推理的显著差距。通过漫画叙事理解的系统研究，发现现有大模型虽擅长单幅画面解析，但在时序因果和跨画面连贯性上表现不佳。本文提出新评估框架，结合多模态标注和跨模态嵌入分析，揭示VLMs的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示现有VLMs在长时序叙事理解中的不足，尤其是时序因果和跨画面连贯性，为提升模型叙事智能提供基础。

Method: 1. 多模态标注协议；2. 多推理范式评估；3. 跨模态相似性分析。应用于308个标注漫画画面，评估生成叙事、上下文对话和时序推理。

Result: 现有模型缺乏故事级智能，尤其在非线性叙事、角色一致性和长时序因果推理上表现不佳。

Conclusion: 本文为评估叙事智能奠定基础，并为提升多模态模型的深层时序理解提供方法论和实用见解。

Abstract: Current Vision Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate a critical gap between
surface-level recognition and deep narrative reasoning when processing
sequential visual storytelling. Through a comprehensive investigation of manga
narrative understanding, we reveal that while recent large multimodal models
excel at individual panel interpretation, they systematically fail at temporal
causality and cross-panel cohesion, core requirements for coherent story
comprehension. We introduce a novel evaluation framework that combines
fine-grained multimodal annotation, cross-modal embedding analysis, and
retrieval-augmented assessment to systematically characterize these
limitations.
  Our methodology includes (i) a rigorous annotation protocol linking visual
elements to narrative structure through aligned light novel text, (ii)
comprehensive evaluation across multiple reasoning paradigms, including direct
inference and retrieval-augmented generation, and (iii) cross-modal similarity
analysis revealing fundamental misalignments in current VLMs' joint
representations. Applying this framework to Re:Zero manga across 11 chapters
with 308 annotated panels, we conduct the first systematic study of long-form
narrative understanding in VLMs through three core evaluation axes: generative
storytelling, contextual dialogue grounding, and temporal reasoning. Our
findings demonstrate that current models lack genuine story-level intelligence,
struggling particularly with non-linear narratives, character consistency, and
causal inference across extended sequences. This work establishes both the
foundation and practical methodology for evaluating narrative intelligence,
while providing actionable insights into the capability of deep sequential
understanding of Discrete Visual Narratives beyond basic recognition in
Multimodal Models.

### [9] [VISOR: Visual Input-based Steering for Output Redirection in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08521)
*Mansi Phute,Ravikumar Balakrishnan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VISOR是一种通过优化视觉输入实现行为控制的新方法，无需侵入模型内部，适用于各种VLM服务模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有行为控制方法（如系统提示）易检测且效果有限，而基于激活的向量需要侵入性访问模型内部，不适用于API服务或闭源部署。

Method: VISOR通过生成通用引导图像，诱导目标激活模式，实现行为控制。

Result: 在LLaVA-1.5-7B上验证，VISOR在拒绝、奉承和生存本能任务中表现优异，单张150KB图像性能接近或超过向量引导。

Conclusion: VISOR展示了视觉引导的强大控制能力，同时暴露了视觉攻击的安全漏洞，呼吁开发防御措施。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly being used in a broad range of
applications, bringing their security and behavioral control to the forefront.
While existing approaches for behavioral control or output redirection, like
system prompting in VLMs, are easily detectable and often ineffective,
activation-based steering vectors require invasive runtime access to model
internals--incompatible with API-based services and closed-source deployments.
We introduce VISOR (Visual Input-based Steering for Output Redirection), a
novel method that achieves sophisticated behavioral control through optimized
visual inputs alone. By crafting universal steering images that induce target
activation patterns, VISOR enables practical deployment across all VLM serving
modalities while remaining imperceptible compared to explicit textual
instructions. We validate VISOR on LLaVA-1.5-7B across three critical alignment
tasks: refusal, sycophancy and survival instinct. A single 150KB steering image
matches steering vector performance within 1-2% for positive behavioral shifts
while dramatically exceeding it for negative steering--achieving up to 25%
shifts from baseline compared to steering vectors' modest changes. Unlike
system prompting (3-4% shifts), VISOR provides robust bidirectional control
while maintaining 99.9% performance on 14,000 unrelated MMLU tasks. Beyond
eliminating runtime overhead and model access requirements, VISOR exposes a
critical security vulnerability: adversaries can achieve sophisticated
behavioral manipulation through visual channels alone, bypassing text-based
defenses. Our work fundamentally re-imagines multimodal model control and
highlights the urgent need for defenses against visual steering attacks.

### [10] [Training Kindai OCR with parallel textline images and self-attention feature distance-based loss](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08537)
*Anh Le,Asanobu Kitamoto*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究通过利用平行文本行图像（近代日语原文与现代日语字体对照）扩充训练数据集，提出了一种基于距离的目标函数以减少自注意力特征间的差异，从而提升OCR性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近代日语文献具有重要历史价值，但转录工作耗时且标注数据稀缺，限制了OCR系统的训练效果。

Method: 引入平行文本行图像，提出基于欧几里得距离和最大均值差异（MMD）的目标函数，优化自注意力特征。

Result: 实验显示，该方法将字符错误率（CER）分别降低了2.23%（欧几里得距离）和3.94%（MMD）。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了历史文献OCR的性能和自注意力表征的判别质量。

Abstract: Kindai documents, written in modern Japanese from the late 19th to early 20th
century, hold significant historical value for researchers studying societal
structures, daily life, and environmental conditions of that period. However,
transcribing these documents remains a labor-intensive and time-consuming task,
resulting in limited annotated data for training optical character recognition
(OCR) systems. This research addresses this challenge of data scarcity by
leveraging parallel textline images - pairs of original Kindai text and their
counterparts in contemporary Japanese fonts - to augment training datasets. We
introduce a distance-based objective function that minimizes the gap between
self-attention features of the parallel image pairs. Specifically, we explore
Euclidean distance and Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) as domain adaptation
metrics. Experimental results demonstrate that our method reduces the character
error rate (CER) by 2.23% and 3.94% over a Transformer-based OCR baseline when
using Euclidean distance and MMD, respectively. Furthermore, our approach
improves the discriminative quality of self-attention representations, leading
to more effective OCR performance for historical documents.

### [11] [Calibration Attention: Instance-wise Temperature Scaling for Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08547)
*Wenhao Liang,Wei Emma Zhang,Lin Yue,Miao Xu,Olaf Maennel,Weitong Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CalAttn的模块，通过学习每个实例的自适应温度来改进Vision Transformers的概率校准，显著降低了校准误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在风险敏感应用中，Vision Transformers的概率校准至关重要，而传统方法（如温度缩放）存在局限性。

Method: CalAttn模块直接从ViT的CLS令牌中学习每个实例的自适应温度，无需额外验证集。

Result: 在多个数据集上，CalAttn将校准误差降低多达4倍，且仅增加不到0.1%的参数。

Conclusion: CalAttn简单高效，适用于多种架构，提供更可信的概率而不牺牲准确性。

Abstract: Probability calibration is critical when Vision Transformers are deployed in
risk-sensitive applications. The standard fix, post-hoc temperature scaling,
uses a single global scalar and requires a held-out validation set. We
introduce Calibration Attention (CalAttn), a drop-in module that learns an
adaptive, per-instance temperature directly from the ViT's CLS token. Across
CIFAR-10/100, MNIST, Tiny-ImageNet, and ImageNet-1K, CalAttn reduces
calibration error by up to 4x on ViT-224, DeiT, and Swin, while adding under
0.1 percent additional parameters. The learned temperatures cluster tightly
around 1.0, in contrast to the large global values used by standard temperature
scaling. CalAttn is simple, efficient, and architecture-agnostic, and yields
more trustworthy probabilities without sacrificing accuracy. Code:

*Wei Li,Pengcheng Zhou,Linye Ma,Wenyi Zhao,Huihua Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种通用框架DTLP-Net，通过多样教师模型和标签传播解决医学图像分割中的半监督学习和域适应问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割中标注数据有限和域偏移是常见挑战，现有方法难以同时解决这些问题。

Method: 采用多样教师模型生成可靠伪标签，结合数据增强和标签传播提升模型性能。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DTLP-Net框架能有效应对半监督学习和域适应任务，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Both limited annotation and domain shift are significant challenges
frequently encountered in medical image segmentation, leading to derivative
scenarios like semi-supervised medical (SSMIS), semi-supervised medical domain
generalization (Semi-MDG) and unsupervised medical domain adaptation (UMDA).
Conventional methods are generally tailored to specific tasks in isolation, the
error accumulation hinders the effective utilization of unlabeled data and
limits further improvements, resulting in suboptimal performance when these
issues occur. In this paper, we aim to develop a generic framework that masters
all three tasks. We found that the key to solving the problem lies in how to
generate reliable pseudo labels for the unlabeled data in the presence of
domain shift with labeled data and increasing the diversity of the model. To
tackle this issue, we employ a Diverse Teaching and Label Propagation Network
(DTLP-Net) to boosting the Generic Semi-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation.
Our DTLP-Net involves a single student model and two diverse teacher models,
which can generate reliable pseudo-labels for the student model. The first
teacher model decouple the training process with labeled and unlabeled data,
The second teacher is momentum-updated periodically, thus generating reliable
yet divers pseudo-labels. To fully utilize the information within the data, we
adopt inter-sample and intra-sample data augmentation to learn the global and
local knowledge. In addition, to further capture the voxel-level correlations,
we propose label propagation to enhance the model robust. We evaluate our
proposed framework on five benchmark datasets for SSMIS, UMDA, and Semi-MDG
tasks. The results showcase notable improvements compared to state-of-the-art
methods across all five settings, indicating the potential of our framework to
tackle more challenging SSL scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FLIPNET通过切换恢复和退化模式，解决了扩散模型在盲脸恢复中的适应性差距，提升了真实性和保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在盲脸恢复中存在适应性差距，主要源于高质量与低质量图像、合成与真实图像之间的差异。

Method: FLIPNET采用统一网络，通过恢复模式和退化模式分别处理图像恢复和退化合成。

Result: 在基准测试中，FLIPNET在真实性和保真度上优于现有方法，并能更好地模拟真实退化。

Conclusion: FLIPNET有效解决了扩散模型在盲脸恢复中的适应性问题，表现优于现有方法。

Abstract: Although diffusion prior is rising as a powerful solution for blind face
restoration (BFR), the inherent gap between the vanilla diffusion model and BFR
settings hinders its seamless adaptation. The gap mainly stems from the
discrepancy between 1) high-quality (HQ) and low-quality (LQ) images and 2)
synthesized and real-world images. The vanilla diffusion model is trained on
images with no or less degradations, whereas BFR handles moderately to severely
degraded images. Additionally, LQ images used for training are synthesized by a
naive degradation model with limited degradation patterns, which fails to
simulate complex and unknown degradations in real-world scenarios. In this
work, we use a unified network FLIPNET that switches between two modes to
resolve specific gaps. In Restoration mode, the model gradually integrates
BFR-oriented features and face embeddings from LQ images to achieve authentic
and faithful face restoration. In Degradation mode, the model synthesizes
real-world like degraded images based on the knowledge learned from real-world
degradation datasets. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets show that our
model 1) outperforms previous diffusion prior based BFR methods in terms of
authenticity and fidelity, and 2) outperforms the naive degradation model in
modeling the real-world degradations.

TL;DR: 提出AutoSAME框架，结合SAM的视觉理解能力，同时完成分割和关键点定位任务，优化左心室指标测量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有算法因训练数据少难以捕捉通用视觉表示，且SAM等视觉基础模型无法识别关键解剖点。

Method: 结合SAM的分割能力与关键点定位任务，提出FCBA和SGPA优化特征表示和提示嵌入。

Result: 在超声心动图数据集上验证了AutoSAME在分割、关键点定位和指标测量上的优越性。

Conclusion: AutoSAME框架通过结合分割与定位任务，显著提升了左心室指标测量的准确性。

Abstract: Left ventricular (LV) indicator measurements following clinical
echocardiog-raphy guidelines are important for diagnosing cardiovascular
disease. Alt-hough existing algorithms have explored automated LV
quantification, they can struggle to capture generic visual representations due
to the normally small training datasets. Therefore, it is necessary to
introduce vision founda-tional models (VFM) with abundant knowledge. However,
VFMs represented by the segment anything model (SAM) are usually suitable for
segmentation but incapable of identifying key anatomical points, which are
critical in LV indicator measurements. In this paper, we propose a novel
framework named AutoSAME, combining the powerful visual understanding of SAM
with seg-mentation and landmark localization tasks simultaneously.
Consequently, the framework mimics the operation of cardiac sonographers,
achieving LV indi-cator measurements consistent with clinical guidelines. We
further present fil-tered cross-branch attention (FCBA) in AutoSAME, which
leverages relatively comprehensive features in the segmentation to enhance the
heatmap regression (HR) of key points from the frequency domain perspective,
optimizing the vis-ual representation learned by the latter. Moreover, we
propose spatial-guided prompt alignment (SGPA) to automatically generate prompt
embeddings guid-ed by spatial properties of LV, thereby improving the accuracy
of dense pre-dictions by prior spatial knowledge. The extensive experiments on
an echocar-diography dataset demonstrate the efficiency of each design and the
superiori-ty of our AutoSAME in LV segmentation, landmark localization, and

Abstract: To enhance group robustness to spurious correlations, prior work often relies
on auxiliary annotations for groups or spurious features and assumes identical
sets of groups across source and target domains. These two requirements are
both unnatural and impractical in real-world settings. To overcome these
limitations, we propose a method that leverages the semantic structure inherent
in class labels--specifically, superclass information--to naturally reduce
reliance on spurious features. Our model employs gradient-based attention
guided by a pre-trained vision-language model to disentangle
superclass-relevant and irrelevant features. Then, by promoting the use of all
superclass-relevant features for prediction, our approach achieves robustness
to more complex spurious correlations without the need to annotate any source
samples. Experiments across diverse datasets demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms baselines in domain generalization tasks, with clear
improvements in both quantitative metrics and qualitative visualizations.

Abstract: Generating human videos with realistic and controllable motions is a
challenging task. While existing methods can generate visually compelling
videos, they lack separate control over four key video elements: foreground
subject, background video, human trajectory and action patterns. In this paper,
we propose a decomposed human motion control and video generation framework
that explicitly decouples motion from appearance, subject from background, and
action from trajectory, enabling flexible mix-and-match composition of these
elements. Concretely, we first build a ground-aware 3D world coordinate system
and perform motion editing directly in the 3D space. Trajectory control is
implemented by unprojecting edited 2D trajectories into 3D with focal-length
calibration and coordinate transformation, followed by speed alignment and
orientation adjustment; actions are supplied by a motion bank or generated via
text-to-motion methods. Then, based on modern text-to-video diffusion
transformer models, we inject the subject as tokens for full attention,
concatenate the background along the channel dimension, and add motion
(trajectory and action) control signals by addition. Such a design opens up the
possibility for us to generate realistic videos of anyone doing anything
anywhere. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets and real-world cases
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both
element-wise controllability and overall video quality.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在文档理解中表现优异，但其推理过程缺乏透明性，难以在高风险领域（如法律、金融、医疗）中确保可靠性。现有方法存在灾难性遗忘、适应性差和跨领域泛化能力有限的问题。

Method: DocThinker采用基于规则的强化学习框架，通过策略学习动态优化推理策略，生成可解释的中间结果（如结构化推理过程、重述问题、支持答案的兴趣区域和最终答案）。结合多目标规则奖励和KL约束优化，提升适应性和透明度。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，DocThinker显著提高了泛化能力，并生成更可解释和易于理解的推理步骤。

Conclusion: 强化学习是提升多模态大语言模型文档理解可解释性和适应性的有效方法。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in document understanding. However, their reasoning processes
remain largely black-box, making it difficult to ensure reliability and
trustworthiness, especially in high-stakes domains such as legal, financial,
and medical document analysis. Existing methods use fixed Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) reasoning with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) but suffer from catastrophic
forgetting, poor adaptability, and limited generalization across domain tasks.
In this paper, we propose DocThinker, a rule-based Reinforcement Learning (RL)
framework for dynamic inference-time reasoning. Instead of relying on static
CoT templates, DocThinker autonomously refines reasoning strategies via policy
learning, generating explainable intermediate results, including structured
reasoning processes, rephrased questions, regions of interest (RoI) supporting
the answer, and the final answer. By integrating multi-objective rule-based
rewards and KL-constrained optimization, our method mitigates catastrophic
forgetting and enhances both adaptability and transparency. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that DocThinker significantly
improves generalization while producing more explainable and
human-understandable reasoning steps. Our findings highlight RL as a powerful
alternative for enhancing explainability and adaptability in MLLM-based
document understanding. Code will be available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: QueryCraft是一种新型的HOI检测框架，通过语义先验和特征学习提升检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决DETR方法中随机初始化查询缺乏语义信息的问题。

Method: 提出ACTOR跨模态Transformer编码器和PDQD解码器，结合语言引导和对象类别感知。

Result: 在HICO-Det和V-COCO基准测试中达到最优性能。

Conclusion: QueryCraft通过语义增强的查询初始化显著提升了HOI检测效果。

Abstract: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection aims to localize human-object pairs
and recognize their interactions in images. Although DETR-based methods have
recently emerged as the mainstream framework for HOI detection, they still
suffer from a key limitation: Randomly initialized queries lack explicit
semantics, leading to suboptimal detection performance. To address this
challenge, we propose QueryCraft, a novel plug-and-play HOI detection framework
that incorporates semantic priors and guided feature learning through
transformer-based query initialization. Central to our approach is
\textbf{ACTOR} (\textbf{A}ction-aware \textbf{C}ross-modal
\textbf{T}ransf\textbf{OR}mer), a cross-modal Transformer encoder that jointly
attends to visual regions and textual prompts to extract action-relevant
features. Rather than merely aligning modalities, ACTOR leverages
language-guided attention to infer interaction semantics and produce
semantically meaningful query representations. To further enhance object-level
query quality, we introduce a \textbf{P}erceptual \textbf{D}istilled
\textbf{Q}uery \textbf{D}ecoder (\textbf{PDQD}), which distills object category
awareness from a pre-trained detector to serve as object query initiation. This
dual-branch query initialization enables the model to generate more
interpretable and effective queries for HOI detection. Extensive experiments on
HICO-Det and V-COCO benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance and strong generalization. Code will be released
upon publication.

Abstract: We present Yan, a foundational framework for interactive video generation,
covering the entire pipeline from simulation and generation to editing.
Specifically, Yan comprises three core modules. AAA-level Simulation: We design
a highly-compressed, low-latency 3D-VAE coupled with a KV-cache-based
shift-window denoising inference process, achieving real-time 1080P/60FPS
interactive simulation. Multi-Modal Generation: We introduce a hierarchical
autoregressive caption method that injects game-specific knowledge into
open-domain multi-modal video diffusion models (VDMs), then transforming the
VDM into a frame-wise, action-controllable, real-time infinite interactive
video generator. Notably, when the textual and visual prompts are sourced from
different domains, the model demonstrates strong generalization, allowing it to
blend and compose the style and mechanics across domains flexibly according to
user prompts. Multi-Granularity Editing: We propose a hybrid model that
explicitly disentangles interactive mechanics simulation from visual rendering,
enabling multi-granularity video content editing during interaction through
text. Collectively, Yan offers an integration of these modules, pushing
interactive video generation beyond isolated capabilities toward a
comprehensive AI-driven interactive creation paradigm, paving the way for the
next generation of creative tools, media, and entertainment. The project page

Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型规模和复杂度的增加，微调成本高昂，需要一种高效的方法将‘弱’模型的适应知识迁移到‘强’模型上。

Method: 提出TransMiter，通过无监督方式捕捉预训练与微调模型间的知识差距，无需反向传播即可实现跨模型知识迁移。

Result: 实验表明，TransMiter能高效迁移适应知识，保持泛化能力，且额外推理成本极低。

Conclusion: TransMiter为视觉语言模型的适应知识迁移提供了一种高效、轻量级的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been widely used in various visual
recognition tasks due to their remarkable generalization capabilities. As these
models grow in size and complexity, fine-tuning becomes costly, emphasizing the
need to reuse adaptation knowledge from 'weaker' models to efficiently enhance
'stronger' ones. However, existing adaptation transfer methods exhibit limited
transferability across models due to their model-specific design and high
computational demands. To tackle this, we propose Transferable Model-agnostic
adapter (TransMiter), a light-weight adapter that improves vision-language
models 'without backpropagation'. TransMiter captures the knowledge gap between
pre-trained and fine-tuned VLMs, in an 'unsupervised' manner. Once trained,
this knowledge can be seamlessly transferred across different models without
the need for backpropagation. Moreover, TransMiter consists of only a few
layers, inducing a negligible additional inference cost. Notably, supplementing
the process with a few labeled data further yields additional performance gain,
often surpassing a fine-tuned stronger model, with a marginal training cost.
Experimental results and analyses demonstrate that TransMiter effectively and
efficiently transfers adaptation knowledge while preserving generalization
abilities across VLMs of different sizes and architectures in visual
recognition tasks.

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了手持视频去模糊的性能，并公开了代码和数据集。

Abstract: Shooting video with a handheld mobile phone, the most common photographic
device, often results in blurry frames due to shaking hands and other
instability factors. Although previous video deblurring methods have achieved
impressive progress, they still struggle to perform satisfactorily on
real-world handheld video due to the blur domain gap between training and
testing data. To address the issue, we propose a self-supervised method for
handheld video deblurring, which is driven by sharp clues in the video. First,
to train the deblurring model, we extract the sharp clues from the video and
take them as misalignment labels of neighboring blurry frames. Second, to
improve the model's ability, we propose a novel Self-Enhanced Video Deblurring
(SEVD) method to create higher-quality paired video data. Third, we propose a
Self-Constrained Spatial Consistency Maintenance (SCSCM) method to regularize
the model, preventing position shifts between the output and input frames.
Moreover, we construct a synthetic and a real-world handheld video dataset for
handheld video deblurring. Extensive experiments on these two and other common
real-world datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms
existing self-supervised ones. The code and datasets are publicly available at

Result: 通过实验评估了不同算法的KL散度和颜色直方图匹配效果。

Conclusion: 该方法为艺术风格迁移和颜色转移提供了有效的评估框架。

Abstract: Neural artistic style transfers and blends the content and style
representation of one image with the style of another. This enables artists to
create unique innovative visuals and enhances artistic expression in various
fields including art, design, and film. Color transfer algorithms are an
important in digital image processing by adjusting the color information in a
target image based on the colors in the source image. Color transfer enhances
images and videos in film and photography, and can aid in image correction. We
introduce a methodology that combines neural artistic style with color
transfer. The method uses the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to
quantitatively evaluate color and luminance histogram matching algorithms
including Reinhard global color transfer, iteration distribution transfer
(IDT), IDT with regrain, Cholesky, and PCA between the original and neural
artistic style transferred image using deep learning. We estimate the color
channel kernel densities. Various experiments are performed to evaluate the KL
of these algorithms and their color histograms for style to content transfer.

Motivation: 现有VIS方法假设对象类别固定且容易遗忘旧类别，无法持续学习新类别。

Method: 设计了帧级和视频级的任务特定提示，结合正交梯度校正（OGC）模块和视频上下文解码器。

Result: HVPL模型在避免灾难性遗忘方面优于基线方法。

Conclusion: HVPL通过分层提示学习有效解决了VIS中的持续学习挑战。

Abstract: Video instance segmentation (VIS) has gained significant attention for its
capability in tracking and segmenting object instances across video frames.
However, most of the existing VIS approaches unrealistically assume that the
categories of object instances remain fixed over time. Moreover, they
experience catastrophic forgetting of old classes when required to continuously
learn object instances belonging to new categories. To resolve these
challenges, we develop a novel Hierarchical Visual Prompt Learning (HVPL) model
that overcomes catastrophic forgetting of previous categories from both
frame-level and video-level perspectives. Specifically, to mitigate forgetting
at the frame level, we devise a task-specific frame prompt and an orthogonal
gradient correction (OGC) module. The OGC module helps the frame prompt encode
task-specific global instance information for new classes in each individual
frame by projecting its gradients onto the orthogonal feature space of old
classes. Furthermore, to address forgetting at the video level, we design a
task-specific video prompt and a video context decoder. This decoder first
embeds structural inter-class relationships across frames into the frame prompt
features, and then propagates task-specific global video contexts from the
frame prompt features to the video prompt. Through rigorous comparisons, our
HVPL model proves to be more effective than baseline approaches. The code is
available at https://github.com/JiahuaDong/HVPL.

Abstract: Ultrasound (US) imaging is increasingly used in spinal procedures due to its
real-time, radiation-free capabilities; however, its effectiveness is hindered
by shadowing artifacts that obscure deeper tissue structures. Traditional
approaches, such as CT-to-US registration, incorporate anatomical information
from preoperative CT scans to guide interventions, but they are limited by
complex registration requirements, differences in spine curvature, and the need
for recent CT imaging. Recent shape completion methods can offer an alternative
by reconstructing spinal structures in US data, while being pretrained on large
set of publicly available CT scans. However, these approaches are typically
offline and have limited reproducibility. In this work, we introduce a novel
integrated system that combines robotic ultrasound with real-time shape
completion to enhance spinal visualization. Our robotic platform autonomously
acquires US sweeps of the lumbar spine, extracts vertebral surfaces from
ultrasound, and reconstructs the complete anatomy using a deep learning-based
shape completion network. This framework provides interactive, real-time
visualization with the capability to autonomously repeat scans and can enable
navigation to target locations. This can contribute to better consistency,
reproducibility, and understanding of the underlying anatomy. We validate our
approach through quantitative experiments assessing shape completion accuracy
and evaluations of multiple spine acquisition protocols on a phantom setup.
Additionally, we present qualitative results of the visualization on a
volunteer scan.

Conclusion: AME是一种即插即用的模块，无需修改主干网络，能显著提升知识蒸馏的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation is a long-established technique for knowledge
transfer, and has regained attention in the context of the recent emergence of
large vision-language models (VLMs). However, vision-language knowledge
distillation often requires sufficient training data to achieve robust
generalization on amples with ambiguous or boundary-adjacent representations,
which are associated with high predictive uncertainty. Critically, collecting
such large-scale, task-specific data for training is often impractical in
real-world scenarios. To address this major challenge arising from the
entanglement of uncertainty and cross-modal feature representation, we propose
Aligned Manifold Entropy for Robust Vision-Language Distillation (AME), aiming
to achieve robust generalization under real-world conditions. AME applies
entropy minimization over a reconfigured shared manifold, where multi-modal
data (i.e., image and text) are bridged through a pair of projection functions,
conducive to structural compression for cross-modal feature representations.
This enables robust knowledge distillation under low-data regimes, while
requiring no architectural modifications to the backbone. As a result, it can
serve as a plug-and-play module compatible with a wide range of vision-language
distillation frameworks. Notably, our theoretical analysis reveals that
integrating knowledge distillation with entropy minimization over the shared
manifold leads to a tighter generalization error bound. Extensive experiments
across diverse distillation architectures and training settings demonstrate
that AME consistently facilitates robust knowledge distillation, resulting in
superior generalization performance across a wide spectrum of downstream tasks.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
predicting agent movements within virtual environments and real-world scenarios
based on visual observations and textual instructions. Although recent research
has focused on enhancing spatial and temporal understanding independently, this
paper presents a novel approach that integrates both aspects through visual
prompting. We introduce a method that projects visual traces of key points from
observations onto depth maps, enabling models to capture both spatial and
temporal information simultaneously. The experiments in SimplerEnv show that
the mean number of tasks successfully solved increased for 4% compared to
SpatialVLA and 19% compared to TraceVLA. Furthermore, we show that this
enhancement can be achieved with minimal training data, making it particularly
valuable for real-world applications where data collection is challenging. The

Abstract: Most prior unsupervised domain adaptation approaches for medical image
segmentation are narrowly tailored to either the source-accessible setting,
where adaptation is guided by source-target alignment, or the source-free
setting, which typically resorts to implicit supervision mechanisms such as
pseudo-labeling and model distillation. This substantial divergence in
methodological designs between the two settings reveals an inherent flaw: the
lack of an explicit, structured construction of anatomical knowledge that
naturally generalizes across domains and settings. To bridge this longstanding
divide, we introduce a unified, semantically grounded framework that supports
both source-accessible and source-free adaptation. Fundamentally distinct from
all prior works, our framework's adaptability emerges naturally as a direct
consequence of the model architecture, without the need for any handcrafted
adaptation strategies. Specifically, our model learns a domain-agnostic
probabilistic manifold as a global space of anatomical regularities, mirroring
how humans establish visual understanding. Thus, the structural content in each
image can be interpreted as a canonical anatomy retrieved from the manifold and
a spatial transformation capturing individual-specific geometry. This
disentangled, interpretable formulation enables semantically meaningful
prediction with intrinsic adaptability. Extensive experiments on challenging
cardiac and abdominal datasets show that our framework achieves
state-of-the-art results in both settings, with source-free performance closely
approaching its source-accessible counterpart, a level of consistency rarely
observed in prior works. Beyond quantitative improvement, we demonstrate strong
interpretability of the proposed framework via manifold traversal for smooth
shape manipulation.

Motivation: 现有方法难以同时满足水印技术的三个关键标准：不可见性、鲁棒性和广泛适用性。

Method: HiWL采用两阶段优化：第一阶段通过分布对齐学习建立共同潜在空间，确保水印不可见和鲁棒性；第二阶段通过广义水印表示学习分离水印与图像内容。

Result: 实验表明，HiWL在提取水印时比现有方法准确率提高7.6%，且处理速度极快（8秒处理10万张图像）。

Conclusion: HiWL有效解决了深度图像水印中的多标准平衡问题，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Deep image watermarking, which refers to enable imperceptible watermark
embedding and reliable extraction in cover images, has shown to be effective
for copyright protection of image assets. However, existing methods face
limitations in simultaneously satisfying three essential criteria for
generalizable watermarking: 1) invisibility (imperceptible hide of watermarks),
2) robustness (reliable watermark recovery under diverse conditions), and 3)
broad applicability (low latency in watermarking process). To address these
limitations, we propose a Hierarchical Watermark Learning (HiWL), a two-stage
optimization that enable a watermarking model to simultaneously achieve three
criteria. In the first stage, distribution alignment learning is designed to
establish a common latent space with two constraints: 1) visual consistency
between watermarked and non-watermarked images, and 2) information invariance
across watermark latent representations. In this way, multi-modal inputs
including watermark message (binary codes) and cover images (RGB pixels) can be
well represented, ensuring the invisibility of watermarks and robustness in
watermarking process thereby. The second stage employs generalized watermark
representation learning to establish a disentanglement policy for separating
watermarks from image content in RGB space. In particular, it strongly
penalizes substantial fluctuations in separated RGB watermarks corresponding to
identical messages. Consequently, HiWL effectively learns generalizable
latent-space watermark representations while maintaining broad applicability.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed method. In
particular, it achieves 7.6\% higher accuracy in watermark extraction than
existing methods, while maintaining extremely low latency (100K images
processed in 8s).

Result: 实验表明，MMIF-AMIN在定量和定性分析中均优于九种现有方法，消融实验验证了各模块的有效性，且在其他图像融合任务中也表现优异。

Conclusion: MMIF-AMIN通过创新的架构和自适应损失函数，显著提升了多模态医学图像融合的性能，并展示了良好的扩展性。

Abstract: Multimodal medical image fusion (MMIF) aims to integrate images from
different modalities to produce a comprehensive image that enhances medical
diagnosis by accurately depicting organ structures, tissue textures, and
metabolic information. Capturing both the unique and complementary information
across multiple modalities simultaneously is a key research challenge in MMIF.
To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel image fusion method,
MMIF-AMIN, which features a new architecture that can effectively extract these
unique and complementary features. Specifically, an Invertible Dense Network
(IDN) is employed for lossless feature extraction from individual modalities.
To extract complementary information between modalities, a Multi-scale
Complementary Feature Extraction Module (MCFEM) is designed, which incorporates
a hybrid attention mechanism, convolutional layers of varying sizes, and
Transformers. An adaptive loss function is introduced to guide model learning,
addressing the limitations of traditional manually-designed loss functions and
enhancing the depth of data mining. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MMIF-AMIN outperforms nine state-of-the-art MMIF methods, delivering superior
results in both quantitative and qualitative analyses. Ablation experiments
confirm the effectiveness of each component of the proposed method.
Additionally, extending MMIF-AMIN to other image fusion tasks also achieves
promising performance.

*Yimeng Geng,Mingyang Zhao,Fan Xu,Guanglin Cao,Gaofeng Meng,Hongbin Liu*

TL;DR: PADReg提出了一种基于接触力的物理感知可变形配准框架，用于超声图像配准，显著提升了配准精度和解剖对齐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超声图像配准在捕捉生物力学特性和提高疾病诊断准确性方面至关重要，但现有方法在大变形下表现不佳，缺乏物理可解释性。

Method: PADReg利用机器人超声系统测量的接触力作为物理先验，构建像素级刚度图，并结合力数据通过轻量级物理感知模块估计变形场。

Result: 实验表明，PADReg的HD95为12.90，比现有方法提升了21.34%。

Conclusion: PADReg通过引入物理约束，实现了更准确的超声图像配准，具有更好的解剖对齐效果。

Abstract: Ultrasound deformable registration estimates spatial transformations between
pairs of deformed ultrasound images, which is crucial for capturing
biomechanical properties and enhancing diagnostic accuracy in diseases such as
thyroid nodules and breast cancer. However, ultrasound deformable registration
remains highly challenging, especially under large deformation. The inherently
low contrast, heavy noise and ambiguous tissue boundaries in ultrasound images
severely hinder reliable feature extraction and correspondence matching.
Existing methods often suffer from poor anatomical alignment and lack physical
interpretability. To address the problem, we propose PADReg, a physics-aware
deformable registration framework guided by contact force. PADReg leverages
synchronized contact force measured by robotic ultrasound systems as a physical
prior to constrain the registration. Specifically, instead of directly
predicting deformation fields, we first construct a pixel-wise stiffness map
utilizing the multi-modal information from contact force and ultrasound images.
The stiffness map is then combined with force data to estimate a dense
deformation field, through a lightweight physics-aware module inspired by
Hooke's law. This design enables PADReg to achieve physically plausible
registration with better anatomical alignment than previous methods relying
solely on image similarity. Experiments on in-vivo datasets demonstrate that it
attains a HD95 of 12.90, which is 21.34\% better than state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种仅使用RGB图像的越野自由空间检测方法ROD，避免了LiDAR数据的高计算需求，实现了50 FPS的高速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 越野场景中自由空间检测因边界模糊而更具挑战性，现有方法依赖LiDAR数据导致计算量大、速度慢，不适合实时应用。

Method: 利用预训练的Vision Transformer (ViT)提取RGB图像特征，并设计轻量高效的解码器。

Result: ROD在ORFD和RELLIS-3D数据集上达到新SOTA，推理速度达50 FPS。

Conclusion: ROD通过RGB-only方法在精度和速度上显著优于现有模型，适合实时应用。

Abstract: Off-road freespace detection is more challenging than on-road scenarios
because of the blurred boundaries of traversable areas. Previous
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods employ multi-modal fusion of RGB images and
LiDAR data. However, due to the significant increase in inference time when
calculating surface normal maps from LiDAR data, multi-modal methods are not
suitable for real-time applications, particularly in real-world scenarios where
higher FPS is required compared to slow navigation. This paper presents a novel
RGB-only approach for off-road freespace detection, named ROD, eliminating the
reliance on LiDAR data and its computational demands. Specifically, we utilize
a pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) to extract rich features from RGB
images. Additionally, we design a lightweight yet efficient decoder, which
together improve both precision and inference speed. ROD establishes a new SOTA
on ORFD and RELLIS-3D datasets, as well as an inference speed of 50 FPS,
significantly outperforming prior models.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的无参考视频质量评估方法CBAND，用于检测和评估视频压缩中的带状伪影，并发布了首个公开视频数据集LIVE-YT-Banding。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高清视频压缩中的带状伪影严重影响观看质量，现有数据集仅针对静态图像，无法捕捉时间动态，因此需要系统性研究和新的数据集。

Method: 创建了LIVE-YT-Banding数据集，包含160个AV1压缩视频，收集了7,200条主观评价；提出CBAND模型，利用深度神经网络嵌入的自然图像统计特性。

Result: CBAND在带状伪影预测性能上显著优于现有模型，速度更快，并可作为可微损失函数优化视频去带状模型。

Conclusion: CBAND和LIVE-YT-Banding数据集为视频质量评估提供了有效工具，推动了压缩视频质量研究的进展。

Abstract: Although there have been notable advancements in video compression
technologies in recent years, banding artifacts remain a serious issue
affecting the quality of compressed videos, particularly on smooth regions of
high-definition videos. Noticeable banding artifacts can severely impact the
perceptual quality of videos viewed on a high-end HDTV or high-resolution
screen. Hence, there is a pressing need for a systematic investigation of the
banding video quality assessment problem for advanced video codecs. Given that
the existing publicly available datasets for studying banding artifacts are
limited to still picture data only, which cannot account for temporal banding
dynamics, we have created a first-of-a-kind open video dataset, dubbed
LIVE-YT-Banding, which consists of 160 videos generated by four different
compression parameters using the AV1 video codec. A total of 7,200 subjective
opinions are collected from a cohort of 45 human subjects. To demonstrate the
value of this new resources, we tested and compared a variety of models that
detect banding occurrences, and measure their impact on perceived quality.
Among these, we introduce an effective and efficient new no-reference (NR)
video quality evaluator which we call CBAND. CBAND leverages the properties of
the learned statistics of natural images expressed in the embeddings of deep
neural networks. Our experimental results show that the perceptual banding
prediction performance of CBAND significantly exceeds that of previous
state-of-the-art models, and is also orders of magnitude faster. Moreover,
CBAND can be employed as a differentiable loss function to optimize video
debanding models. The LIVE-YT-Banding database, code, and pre-trained model are
all publically available at https://github.com/uniqzheng/CBAND.

Motivation: 现有方法在修复模型时依赖手动设计的提示生成合成图像，容易导致分布偏移和语义错误，因此需要更有效的修复策略。

Conclusion: 提出的目标修复策略有效提升了模型性能，代码已开源。

Abstract: Deep learning models for visual recognition often exhibit systematic errors
due to underrepresented semantic subpopulations. Although existing debugging
frameworks can pinpoint these failures by identifying key failure attributes,
repairing the model effectively remains difficult. Current solutions often rely
on manually designed prompts to generate synthetic training images -- an
approach prone to distribution shift and semantic errors. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce a model repair module that builds on an interpretable
failure attribution pipeline. Our approach uses a conditional text-to-image
model to generate semantically faithful and targeted images for failure cases.
To preserve the quality and relevance of the generated samples, we further
employ a large vision-language model (LVLM) to filter the outputs, enforcing
alignment with the original data distribution and maintaining semantic
consistency. By retraining vision models with this rare-case-augmented
synthetic dataset, we significantly reduce errors associated with rare cases.
Our experiments demonstrate that this targeted repair strategy improves model
robustness without introducing new bugs. Code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应置信损失（ACW）和边界预期校准误差（BECE）方法，用于提升眼内透镜结构分割的精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度分割网络在交叉熵损失下对所有像素平等加权，忽略了透镜结构子区域的不均匀性和边界区域的校准问题。

Method: 通过置信阈值将透镜结构子区域分组，应用区域加权损失，并设计自适应阈值优化算法。同时提出BECE指标量化边界区域的校准误差。

Result: 在临床数据集上，ACW显著优于其他方法，IoU提升6.13%，DSC增加4.33%，BECE降低4.79%。

Conclusion: ACW和BECE有效提升了透镜结构分割的精度和校准性能。

Abstract: Precise lens structure segmentation is essential for the design of
intraocular lenses (IOLs) in cataract surgery. Existing deep segmentation
networks typically weight all pixels equally under cross-entropy (CE) loss,
overlooking the fact that sub-regions of lens structures are inhomogeneous
(e.g., some regions perform better than others) and that boundary regions often
suffer from poor segmentation calibration at the pixel level. Clinically,
experts annotate different sub-regions of lens structures with varying
confidence levels, considering factors such as sub-region proportions,
ambiguous boundaries, and lens structure shapes. Motivated by this observation,
we propose an Adaptive Confidence-Wise (ACW) loss to group each lens structure
sub-region into different confidence sub-regions via a confidence threshold
from the unique region aspect, aiming to exploit the potential of expert
annotation confidence prior. Specifically, ACW clusters each target region into
low-confidence and high-confidence groups and then applies a region-weighted
loss to reweigh each confidence group. Moreover, we design an adaptive
confidence threshold optimization algorithm to adjust the confidence threshold
of ACW dynamically. Additionally, to better quantify the miscalibration errors
in boundary region segmentation, we propose a new metric, termed Boundary
Expected Calibration Error (BECE). Extensive experiments on a clinical lens
structure AS-OCT dataset and other multi-structure datasets demonstrate that
our ACW significantly outperforms competitive segmentation loss methods across
different deep segmentation networks (e.g., MedSAM). Notably, our method
surpasses CE with 6.13% IoU gain, 4.33% DSC increase, and 4.79% BECE reduction
in lens structure segmentation under U-Net. The code of this paper is available
at https://github.com/XiaoLing12138/Adaptive-Confidence-Wise-Loss.

TL;DR: 提出了一种模拟社交网络视频共享管道的框架，通过估计压缩和调整参数，生成接近真实上传视频的退化模式，从而提升深度伪造检测器的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI生成的视频在社交网络上的普及使得深度伪造检测器在真实场景中表现不佳，主要原因是平台专有的压缩技术破坏了低级取证线索。

Method: 通过从小量上传视频中估计压缩和调整参数，构建本地模拟器，大规模生成平台特定的退化模式。

Result: 实验表明，模拟数据与真实上传视频的退化模式高度匹配，检测器在模拟数据上的微调表现接近真实共享媒体。

Conclusion: 该方法为实验室训练与真实部署之间的差距提供了可扩展且实用的解决方案，尤其在压缩视频内容领域。

Abstract: The growing presence of AI-generated videos on social networks poses new
challenges for deepfake detection, as detectors trained under controlled
conditions often fail to generalize to real-world scenarios. A key factor
behind this gap is the aggressive, proprietary compression applied by platforms
like YouTube and Facebook, which launder low-level forensic cues. However,
replicating these transformations at scale is difficult due to API limitations
and data-sharing constraints. For these reasons, we propose a first framework
that emulates the video sharing pipelines of social networks by estimating
compression and resizing parameters from a small set of uploaded videos. These
parameters enable a local emulator capable of reproducing platform-specific
artifacts on large datasets without direct API access. Experiments on
FaceForensics++ videos shared via social networks demonstrate that our emulated
data closely matches the degradation patterns of real uploads. Furthermore,
detectors fine-tuned on emulated videos achieve comparable performance to those
trained on actual shared media. Our approach offers a scalable and practical
solution for bridging the gap between lab-based training and real-world
deployment of deepfake detectors, particularly in the underexplored domain of
compressed video content.

TL;DR: ROOMELSA是一个新的基准测试，旨在评估系统在复杂场景中通过自然语言描述检索3D模型的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D检索系统适用于简单场景，但现实场景更复杂，需要从模糊描述中识别物体。

Method: ROOMELSA通过全景房间图像中的特定区域，从大型数据库中检索对应的3D模型。

Result: 测试显示，仅一个顶级模型在所有案例中表现一致，轻量级CLIP模型表现良好但存在细微错误。

Conclusion: ROOMELSA为推进现实世界的3D识别系统设立了新基准，强调了视觉与语言理解的紧密结合。

Abstract: Recent 3D retrieval systems are typically designed for simple, controlled
scenarios, such as identifying an object from a cropped image or a brief
description. However, real-world scenarios are more complex, often requiring
the recognition of an object in a cluttered scene based on a vague, free-form
description. To this end, we present ROOMELSA, a new benchmark designed to
evaluate a system's ability to interpret natural language. Specifically,
ROOMELSA attends to a specific region within a panoramic room image and
accurately retrieves the corresponding 3D model from a large database. In
addition, ROOMELSA includes over 1,600 apartment scenes, nearly 5,200 rooms,
and more than 44,000 targeted queries. Empirically, while coarse object
retrieval is largely solved, only one top-performing model consistently ranked
the correct match first across nearly all test cases. Notably, a lightweight
CLIP-based model also performed well, although it struggled with subtle
variations in materials, part structures, and contextual cues, resulting in
occasional errors. These findings highlight the importance of tightly
integrating visual and language understanding. By bridging the gap between
scene-level grounding and fine-grained 3D retrieval, ROOMELSA establishes a new
benchmark for advancing robust, real-world 3D recognition systems.

TL;DR: DiffPose-Animal是一种基于扩散模型的动物姿态估计新方法，利用语言模型提取解剖学先验，并通过扩散过程逐步优化姿态预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动物姿态估计在生态监测和行为分析中具有重要价值，但由于物种形态多样性和数据标注有限，现有方法面临挑战。

Method: 提出DiffPose-Animal框架，将姿态估计重构为扩散模型的去噪过程，结合语言模型提取的解剖学先验和图像特征。

Result: 在公开数据集上验证了方法的有效性，尤其在物种多样性和遮挡场景下表现优异。

Conclusion: DiffPose-Animal通过结合生成模型和语义先验，显著提升了动物姿态估计的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Animal pose estimation is a fundamental task in computer vision, with growing
importance in ecological monitoring, behavioral analysis, and intelligent
livestock management. Compared to human pose estimation, animal pose estimation
is more challenging due to high interspecies morphological diversity, complex
body structures, and limited annotated data. In this work, we introduce
DiffPose-Animal, a novel diffusion-based framework for top-down animal pose
estimation. Unlike traditional heatmap regression methods, DiffPose-Animal
reformulates pose estimation as a denoising process under the generative
framework of diffusion models. To enhance semantic guidance during keypoint
generation, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to extract both global
anatomical priors and local keypoint-wise semantics based on species-specific
prompts. These textual priors are encoded and fused with image features via
cross-attention modules to provide biologically meaningful constraints
throughout the denoising process. Additionally, a diffusion-based keypoint
decoder is designed to progressively refine pose predictions, improving
robustness to occlusion and annotation sparsity. Extensive experiments on
public animal pose datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization
capability of our method, especially under challenging scenarios with diverse
species, cluttered backgrounds, and incomplete keypoints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统均匀锐化忽略纹理变化，降低视频质量且增加比特率，缺乏优化比特分配的技术。

Method: 利用CTU分区掩码作为先验信息，指导并约束增加的比特分配，实现端到端的区域自适应锐化。

Result: 实验证明模型在质量和比特率节省方面均有效。

Conclusion: RPO-AdaSharp通过区域自适应方法解决了均匀锐化的局限性，实现了感知增强和比特率优化的双重目标。

Abstract: Sharpening is a widely adopted video enhancement technique. However, uniform
sharpening intensity ignores texture variations, degrading video quality.
Sharpening also increases bitrate, and there's a lack of techniques to
optimally allocate these additional bits across diverse regions. Thus, this
paper proposes RPO-AdaSharp, an end-to-end region-adaptive video sharpening
model for both perceptual enhancement and bitrate savings. We use the coding
tree unit (CTU) partition mask as prior information to guide and constrain the
allocation of increased bits. Experiments on benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed model qualitatively and quantitatively.

Conclusion: MonoPartNeRF通过创新的变形和姿态建模方法，显著提升了单目动态人体渲染的质量和鲁棒性。

Abstract: In recent years, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have achieved remarkable
progress in dynamic human reconstruction and rendering. Part-based rendering
paradigms, guided by human segmentation, allow for flexible parameter
allocation based on structural complexity, thereby enhancing representational
efficiency. However, existing methods still struggle with complex pose
variations, often producing unnatural transitions at part boundaries and
failing to reconstruct occluded regions accurately in monocular settings. We
propose MonoPartNeRF, a novel framework for monocular dynamic human rendering
that ensures smooth transitions and robust occlusion recovery. First, we build
a bidirectional deformation model that combines rigid and non-rigid
transformations to establish a continuous, reversible mapping between
observation and canonical spaces. Sampling points are projected into a
parameterized surface-time space (u, v, t) to better capture non-rigid motion.
A consistency loss further suppresses deformation-induced artifacts and
discontinuities. We introduce a part-based pose embedding mechanism that
decomposes global pose vectors into local joint embeddings based on body
regions. This is combined with keyframe pose retrieval and interpolation, along
three orthogonal directions, to guide pose-aware feature sampling. A learnable
appearance code is integrated via attention to model dynamic texture changes
effectively. Experiments on the ZJU-MoCap and MonoCap datasets demonstrate that
our method significantly outperforms prior approaches under complex pose and
occlusion conditions, achieving superior joint alignment, texture fidelity, and
structural continuity.

Conclusion: 该方法简单有效，解决了身份保留问题，并提供了实用参数估计公式。

Abstract: Face aging or de-aging with generative AI has gained significant attention
for its applications in such fields like forensics, security, and media.
However, most state of the art methods rely on conditional Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs), Diffusion-based models, or Visual Language Models
(VLMs) to age or de-age faces based on predefined age categories and
conditioning via loss functions, fine-tuning, or text prompts. The reliance on
such conditioning leads to complex training requirements, increased data needs,
and challenges in generating consistent results. Additionally, identity
preservation is rarely taken into accountor evaluated on a single face
recognition system without any control or guarantees on whether identity would
be preserved in a generated aged/de-aged face. In this paper, we propose to
synthesize aged and de-aged faces via editing latent space of StyleGAN2 using a
simple support vector modeling of aging/de-aging direction and several feature
selection approaches. By using two state-of-the-art face recognition systems,
we empirically find the identity preserving subspace within the StyleGAN2
latent space, so that an apparent age of a given face can changed while
preserving the identity. We then propose a simple yet practical formula for
estimating the limits on aging/de-aging parameters that ensures identity
preservation for a given input face. Using our method and estimated parameters
we have generated a public dataset of synthetic faces at different ages that
can be used for benchmarking cross-age face recognition, age assurance systems,
or systems for detection of synthetic images. Our code and dataset are
available at the project page https://www.idiap.ch/paper/agesynth/

Conclusion: 偏移学习范式有效解决了类别与特征不对齐问题，显著提升轻量级语义分割性能，且易于集成到现有方法中。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is fundamental to vision systems requiring pixel-level
scene understanding, yet deploying it on resource-constrained devices demands
efficient architectures. Although existing methods achieve real-time inference
through lightweight designs, we reveal their inherent limitation: misalignment
between class representations and image features caused by a per-pixel
classification paradigm. With experimental analysis, we find that this paradigm
results in a highly challenging assumption for efficient scenarios: Image pixel
features should not vary for the same category in different images. To address
this dilemma, we propose a coupled dual-branch offset learning paradigm that
explicitly learns feature and class offsets to dynamically refine both class
representations and spatial image features. Based on the proposed paradigm, we
construct an efficient semantic segmentation network, OffSeg. Notably, the
offset learning paradigm can be adopted to existing methods with no additional
architectural changes. Extensive experiments on four datasets, including
ADE20K, Cityscapes, COCO-Stuff-164K, and Pascal Context, demonstrate consistent
improvements with negligible parameters. For instance, on the ADE20K dataset,
our proposed offset learning paradigm improves SegFormer-B0, SegNeXt-T, and
Mask2Former-Tiny by 2.7%, 1.9%, and 2.6% mIoU, respectively, with only 0.1-0.2M
additional parameters required.

Result: TARA实现了无需训练的多概念组合，有效保留各概念的视觉身份。

Conclusion: TARA通过避免模块间干扰，提升了多概念生成的效率和效果。

Abstract: Personalized text-to-image generation aims to synthesize novel images of a
specific subject or style using only a few reference images. Recent methods
based on Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) enable efficient single-concept
customization by injecting lightweight, concept-specific adapters into
pre-trained diffusion models. However, combining multiple LoRA modules for
multi-concept generation often leads to identity missing and visual feature
leakage. In this work, we identify two key issues behind these failures: (1)
token-wise interference among different LoRA modules, and (2) spatial
misalignment between the attention map of a rare token and its corresponding
concept-specific region. To address these issues, we propose Token-Aware LoRA
(TARA), which introduces a token mask to explicitly constrain each module to
focus on its associated rare token to avoid interference, and a training
objective that encourages the spatial attention of a rare token to align with
its concept region. Our method enables training-free multi-concept composition
by directly injecting multiple independently trained TARA modules at inference
time. Experimental results demonstrate that TARA enables efficient
multi-concept inference and effectively preserving the visual identity of each
concept by avoiding mutual interference between LoRA modules. The code and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在空间推理方面表现有限，需要一种无需额外数据的方法来生成3D对象原型。

Method: 采用代理式流程（设计师、编码员、视觉检查员）在细化循环中生成3D原型，包括几何和部件标签。

Result: 生成的渲染图像在图像分类预训练任务中表现优于先前方法15%，并在细粒度视觉语言模型中实现55%的准确率提升。

Conclusion: 3DFroMLLM框架有效扩展了MLLMs的能力，为3D生成和视觉语言任务提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Recent Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong
capabilities in learning joint representations from text and images. However,
their spatial reasoning remains limited. We introduce 3DFroMLLM, a novel
framework that enables the generation of 3D object prototypes directly from
MLLMs, including geometry and part labels. Our pipeline is agentic, comprising
a designer, coder, and visual inspector operating in a refinement loop.
Notably, our approach requires no additional training data or detailed user
instructions. Building on prior work in 2D generation, we demonstrate that
rendered images produced by our framework can be effectively used for image
classification pretraining tasks and outperforms previous methods by 15%. As a
compelling real-world use case, we show that the generated prototypes can be
leveraged to improve fine-grained vision-language models by using the rendered,
part-labeled prototypes to fine-tune CLIP for part segmentation and achieving a
55% accuracy improvement without relying on any additional human-labeled data.

### [44] [A Parametric Bi-Directional Curvature-Based Framework for Image Artifact Classification and Quantification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08824)
*Diego Frias*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于方向性图像曲率分析的无参考图像质量评估（NR-IQA）框架，通过各向异性纹理丰富度（ATR）衡量图像质量，并在分类和量化图像退化方面表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像质量评估方法难以准确分类和量化不同类型的图像退化，需要一种能够同时实现高精度分类和量化退化的新方法。

Method: 定义ATR指标，通过两个可调阈值计算像素级的正交纹理抑制；利用ATR对不同失真的差异响应，构建两阶段系统（分类和回归）来评估图像质量。

Result: 在LIVE数据集上，ATR对高斯模糊和白噪声的Spearman相关性分别达到-0.93和-0.95；分类准确率超97%，R2为0.892，RMSE为5.17 DMOS。

Conclusion: 该框架在图像退化分类和量化方面具有高精度和鲁棒性，是一种高效的双用途工具。

Abstract: This work presents a novel framework for No-Reference Image Quality
Assessment (NR-IQA) founded on the analysis of directional image curvature.
Within this framework, we define a measure of Anisotropic Texture Richness
(ATR), which is computed at the pixel level using two tunable thresholds -- one
permissive and one restrictive -- that quantify orthogonal texture suppression.
When its parameters are optimized for a specific artifact, the resulting ATR
score serves as a high-performance quality metric, achieving Spearman
correlations with human perception of approximately -0.93 for Gaussian blur and
-0.95 for white noise on the LIVE dataset. The primary contribution is a
two-stage system that leverages the differential response of ATR to various
distortions. First, the system utilizes the signature from two specialist ATR
configurations to classify the primary artifact type (blur vs. noise) with over
97% accuracy. Second, following classification, it employs a dedicated
regression model mapping the relevant ATR score to a quality rating to quantify
the degradation. On a combined dataset, the complete system predicts human
scores with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.892 and a Root Mean Square
Error (RMSE) of 5.17 DMOS points. This error corresponds to just 7.4% of the
dataset's total quality range, demonstrating high predictive accuracy. This
establishes our framework as a robust, dual-purpose tool for the classification
and subsequent quantification of image degradation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高频分量对视频清晰度和真实感至关重要，但会增加编码码率，导致带宽和存储成本上升。

Method: 使用FFPN预测最优高频预处理策略，并通过伪标签训练FFPN，比较不同预处理类型和强度的率失真性能。

Result: 在多个数据集上验证了框架在视觉质量提升和码率节省方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架能有效平衡视频压缩后的码率和质量，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: High-frequency components are crucial for maintaining video clarity and
realism, but they also significantly impact coding bitrate, resulting in
increased bandwidth and storage costs. This paper presents an end-to-end
learning-based framework for adaptive high-frequency preprocessing to enhance
subjective quality and save bitrate in video coding. The framework employs the
Frequency-attentive Feature pyramid Prediction Network (FFPN) to predict the
optimal high-frequency preprocessing strategy, guiding subsequent filtering
operators to achieve the optimal tradeoff between bitrate and quality after
compression. For training FFPN, we pseudo-label each training video with the
optimal strategy, determined by comparing the rate-distortion (RD) performance
across different preprocessing types and strengths. Distortion is measured
using the latest quality assessment metric. Comprehensive evaluations on
multiple datasets demonstrate the visually appealing enhancement capabilities
and bitrate savings achieved by our framework.

Result: 在基准数据集上实现了优于现有方法的实时渲染能力，并能可视化不同时间点的场景变化。

Conclusion: GaussianUpdate为动态场景的新视图合成提供了一种高效且灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Novel view synthesis with neural models has advanced rapidly in recent years,
yet adapting these models to scene changes remains an open problem. Existing
methods are either labor-intensive, requiring extensive model retraining, or
fail to capture detailed types of changes over time. In this paper, we present
GaussianUpdate, a novel approach that combines 3D Gaussian representation with
continual learning to address these challenges. Our method effectively updates
the Gaussian radiance fields with current data while preserving information
from past scenes. Unlike existing methods, GaussianUpdate explicitly models
different types of changes through a novel multi-stage update strategy.
Additionally, we introduce a visibility-aware continual learning approach with
generative replay, enabling self-aware updating without the need to store
images. The experiments on the benchmark dataset demonstrate our method
achieves superior and real-time rendering with the capability of visualizing
changes over different times

Abstract: Robust depth estimation in light field imaging remains a critical challenge
for pattern recognition applications such as augmented reality, biomedical
imaging, and scene reconstruction. While existing approaches often rely heavily
on deep convolutional neural networks, they tend to incur high computational
costs and struggle in noisy real-world environments. This paper proposes a
novel lightweight depth estimation pipeline that integrates light field-based
disparity information with a directed random walk refinement algorithm. Unlike
traditional CNN-based methods, our approach enhances depth map consistency
without requiring extensive training or large-scale datasets. The proposed
method was evaluated on the 4D Light Field Benchmark dataset and a diverse set
of real-world images. Experimental results indicate that while performance
slightly declines under uncontrolled conditions, the algorithm consistently
maintains low computational complexity and competitive accuracy compared to
state-of-the-art deep learning models. These findings highlight the potential
of our method as a robust and efficient alternative for depth estimation and
segmentation in light field imaging. The work provides insights into practical
algorithm design for light field-based pattern recognition and opens new
directions for integrating probabilistic graph models with depth sensing
frameworks.

TL;DR: MaskClu是一种结合掩码点建模和聚类学习的无监督预训练方法，用于3D点云的视觉变换器（ViTs），通过重建聚类分配和中心点，以及全局对比学习，提升语义特征学习。


<details>

Motivation: 当前ViTs在3D点云理解中主要通过掩码自编码预训练，但学习密集且信息丰富的语义特征仍未被充分探索。

Method: MaskClu结合掩码点建模和聚类学习，重建聚类分配与中心点，并引入全局对比学习机制。

Result: 在多个3D任务（如部分分割、语义分割、目标检测和分类）中，MaskClu取得了新的竞争性结果。

Conclusion: MaskClu通过联合优化密集语义重建和实例级对比学习，使ViTs能从3D点云中学习更丰富且语义更有意义的表示。

Abstract: Vision transformers (ViTs) have recently been widely applied to 3D point
cloud understanding, with masked autoencoding as the predominant pre-training
paradigm. However, the challenge of learning dense and informative semantic
features from point clouds via standard ViTs remains underexplored. We propose
MaskClu, a novel unsupervised pre-training method for ViTs on 3D point clouds
that integrates masked point modeling with clustering-based learning. MaskClu
is designed to reconstruct both cluster assignments and cluster centers from
masked point clouds, thus encouraging the model to capture dense semantic
information. Additionally, we introduce a global contrastive learning mechanism
that enhances instance-level feature learning by contrasting different masked
views of the same point cloud. By jointly optimizing these complementary
objectives, i.e., dense semantic reconstruction, and instance-level contrastive
learning. MaskClu enables ViTs to learn richer and more semantically meaningful
representations from 3D point clouds. We validate the effectiveness of our
method via multiple 3D tasks, including part segmentation, semantic
segmentation, object detection, and classification, where MaskClu sets new
competitive results. The code and models will be released

Motivation: 目前大多数自动化肿瘤分割和报告生成研究集中在术前数据，术后影像分析关注较少，本研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 使用Attention U-Net训练分割模型（术前肿瘤核心、术后残留肿瘤和切除腔），DenseNet用于MR序列分类和肿瘤类型识别，遵循RANO 2.0指南。

Result: 分割模型的Dice分数为87%（肿瘤核心）、66%（非增强核心）、70%（残留肿瘤）和77%（切除腔）；分类模型准确率达99.5%（序列分类）和80%（肿瘤类型分类）。

Conclusion: 该流程实现了术后CNS肿瘤的自动化分析和标准化报告生成，提升了临床决策效率，并整合到开源平台Raidionics中。

Abstract: Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is essential for evaluating central nervous
system (CNS) tumors, guiding surgical planning, treatment decisions, and
assessing postoperative outcomes and complication risks. While recent work has
advanced automated tumor segmentation and report generation, most efforts have
focused on preoperative data, with limited attention to postoperative imaging
analysis. This study introduces a comprehensive pipeline for standardized
postsurtical reporting in CNS tumors. Using the Attention U-Net architecture,
segmentation models were trained for the preoperative (non-enhancing) tumor
core, postoperative contrast-enhancing residual tumor, and resection cavity.
Additionally, MR sequence classification and tumor type identification for
contrast-enhancing lesions were explored using the DenseNet architecture. The
models were integrated into a reporting pipeline, following the RANO 2.0
guidelines. Training was conducted on multicentric datasets comprising 2000 to
7000 patients, using a 5-fold cross-validation. Evaluation included patient-,
voxel-, and object-wise metrics, with benchmarking against the latest BraTS
challenge results. The segmentation models achieved average voxel-wise Dice
scores of 87%, 66%, 70%, and 77% for the tumor core, non-enhancing tumor core,
contrast-enhancing residual tumor, and resection cavity, respectively.
Classification models reached 99.5% balanced accuracy in MR sequence
classification and 80% in tumor type classification. The pipeline presented in
this study enables robust, automated segmentation, MR sequence classification,
and standardized report generation aligned with RANO 2.0 guidelines, enhancing
postoperative evaluation and clinical decision-making. The proposed models and
methods were integrated into Raidionics, open-source software platform for CNS
tumor analysis, now including a dedicated module for postsurgical analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将场景识别简化为基于欧氏距离的度量学习任务，忽略了特征空间的内在结构和类内方差，导致在复杂环境和时变场景中表现不佳。

Method: 提出了一种交叉视图网络，结合伪全局信息引导机制和多模态分支，在统一语义空间中进行特征学习，并使用SPD矩阵计算马氏距离。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在复杂环境条件下表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法通过流形适应和几何公式化，能够更准确地捕捉数据分布和类间依赖关系，显著提升了场景识别性能。

Abstract: LiDAR-based Place Recognition (LPR) remains a critical task in Embodied
Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Autonomous Driving, primarily addressing
localization challenges in GPS-denied environments and supporting loop closure
detection. Existing approaches reduce place recognition to a Euclidean
distance-based metric learning task, neglecting the feature space's intrinsic
structures and intra-class variances. Such Euclidean-centric formulation
inherently limits the model's capacity to capture nonlinear data distributions,
leading to suboptimal performance in complex environments and temporal-varying
scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a novel cross-view network
based on an innovative fusion paradigm. Our framework introduces a
pseudo-global information guidance mechanism that coordinates multi-modal
branches to perform feature learning within a unified semantic space.
Concurrently, we propose a Manifold Adaptation and Pairwise Variance-Locality
Learning Metric that constructs a Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrix to
compute Mahalanobis distance, superseding traditional Euclidean distance
metrics. This geometric formulation enables the model to accurately
characterize intrinsic data distributions and capture complex inter-class
dependencies within the feature space. Experimental results demonstrate that
the proposed algorithm achieves competitive performance, particularly excelling
in complex environmental conditions.

Method: 采用傅里叶特征编码和动态体素选择（通过形态学膨胀优先处理活跃区域），无需分层元数据。

Result: 稀疏训练减少63.7%训练时间（30分钟降至11分钟），PSNR仅下降0.59 dB，SSIM下降0.008，压缩率为14。

Conclusion: 该方法为体数据压缩提供了高效、无结构且可扩展的解决方案，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Volumetric data compression is critical in fields like medical imaging,
scientific simulation, and entertainment. We introduce a structure-free neural
compression method combining Fourierfeature encoding with selective voxel
sampling, yielding compact volumetric representations and faster convergence.
Our dynamic voxel selection uses morphological dilation to prioritize active
regions, reducing redundant computation without any hierarchical metadata. In
the experiment, sparse training reduced training time by 63.7 % (from 30 to 11
minutes) with only minor quality loss: PSNR dropped 0.59 dB (from 32.60 to
32.01) and SSIM by 0.008 (from 0.948 to 0.940). The resulting neural
representation, stored solely as network weights, achieves a compression rate
of 14 and eliminates traditional data-loading overhead. This connects
coordinate-based neural representation with efficient volumetric compression,
offering a scalable, structure-free solution for practical applications.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于CLIP的零样本方法用于人脸变形攻击检测（MAD），通过设计并聚合多个文本提示，无需额外训练即可提升检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人脸变形攻击（MAD）对识别系统构成威胁，现有方法多依赖微调，忽视了基础模型（如CLIP）的直接通用性潜力。

Method: 利用CLIP的零样本能力，设计并聚合多个文本提示的嵌入，以更丰富地捕捉真实样本与攻击样本的差异。

Result: 提示聚合显著提升了零样本检测性能，验证了通过高效提示工程利用基础模型内置多模态知识的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过零样本方法和提示聚合，CLIP可直接用于MAD任务，展示了基础模型在生物识别中的通用潜力。

Abstract: Face Morphing Attack Detection (MAD) is a critical challenge in face
recognition security, where attackers can fool systems by interpolating the
identity information of two or more individuals into a single face image,
resulting in samples that can be verified as belonging to multiple identities
by face recognition systems. While multimodal foundation models (FMs) like CLIP
offer strong zero-shot capabilities by jointly modeling images and text, most
prior works on FMs for biometric recognition have relied on fine-tuning for
specific downstream tasks, neglecting their potential for direct, generalizable
deployment. This work explores a pure zero-shot approach to MAD by leveraging
CLIP without any additional training or fine-tuning, focusing instead on the
design and aggregation of multiple textual prompts per class. By aggregating
the embeddings of diverse prompts, we better align the model's internal
representations with the MAD task, capturing richer and more varied cues
indicative of bona-fide or attack samples. Our results show that prompt
aggregation substantially improves zero-shot detection performance,
demonstrating the effectiveness of exploiting foundation models' built-in
multimodal knowledge through efficient prompt engineering.

Abstract: Skeleton-based action recognition (SAR) has achieved impressive progress with
transformer architectures. However, existing methods often rely on complex
module compositions and heavy designs, leading to increased parameter counts,
high computational costs, and limited scalability. In this paper, we propose a
unified spatio-temporal lightweight transformer framework that integrates
spatial and temporal modeling within a single attention module, eliminating the
need for separate temporal modeling blocks. This approach reduces redundant
computations while preserving temporal awareness within the spatial modeling
process. Furthermore, we introduce a simplified multi-scale pooling fusion
module that combines local and global pooling pathways to enhance the model's
ability to capture fine-grained local movements and overarching global motion
patterns. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our
lightweight model achieves a superior balance between accuracy and efficiency,
reducing parameter complexity by over 58% and lowering computational cost by
over 60% compared to state-of-the-art transformer-based baselines, while
maintaining competitive recognition performance.

Method: 提出Layout-Togglable Storytelling任务，引入布局条件；构建Lay2Story-1M数据集和Lay2Story-Bench基准；基于DiTs架构开发Lay2Story框架。

Result: Lay2Story在一致性、语义相关性和美学质量上优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 布局条件显著提升叙事任务的主题一致性和控制能力，Lay2Story框架为相关研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Storytelling tasks involving generating consistent subjects have gained
significant attention recently. However, existing methods, whether
training-free or training-based, continue to face challenges in maintaining
subject consistency due to the lack of fine-grained guidance and inter-frame
interaction. Additionally, the scarcity of high-quality data in this field
makes it difficult to precisely control storytelling tasks, including the
subject's position, appearance, clothing, expression, and posture, thereby
hindering further advancements. In this paper, we demonstrate that layout
conditions, such as the subject's position and detailed attributes, effectively
facilitate fine-grained interactions between frames. This not only strengthens
the consistency of the generated frame sequence but also allows for precise
control over the subject's position, appearance, and other key details.
Building on this, we introduce an advanced storytelling task: Layout-Togglable
Storytelling, which enables precise subject control by incorporating layout
conditions. To address the lack of high-quality datasets with layout
annotations for this task, we develop Lay2Story-1M, which contains over 1
million 720p and higher-resolution images, processed from approximately 11,300
hours of cartoon videos. Building on Lay2Story-1M, we create Lay2Story-Bench, a
benchmark with 3,000 prompts designed to evaluate the performance of different
methods on this task. Furthermore, we propose Lay2Story, a robust framework
based on the Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) architecture for Layout-Togglable
Storytelling tasks. Through both qualitative and quantitative experiments, we
find that our method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA)
techniques, achieving the best results in terms of consistency, semantic
correlation, and aesthetic quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统变化检测方法需要专业知识，而现有CDVQA方法假设训练和测试数据分布相似，不适用于实际应用中的领域偏移。

Method: 提出TCSSM模型，结合双时相图像和地理灾害文本信息，提取跨领域不变特征。

Result: 实验表明TCSSM优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TCSSM有效解决了CDVQA中的领域偏移问题，代码和数据集将公开。

Abstract: The Earth's surface is constantly changing, and detecting these changes
provides valuable insights that benefit various aspects of human society. While
traditional change detection methods have been employed to detect changes from
bi-temporal images, these approaches typically require expert knowledge for
accurate interpretation. To enable broader and more flexible access to change
information by non-expert users, the task of Change Detection Visual Question
Answering (CDVQA) has been introduced. However, existing CDVQA methods have
been developed under the assumption that training and testing datasets share
similar distributions. This assumption does not hold in real-world
applications, where domain shifts often occur. In this paper, the CDVQA task is
revisited with a focus on addressing domain shift. To this end, a new
multi-modal and multi-domain dataset, BrightVQA, is introduced to facilitate
domain generalization research in CDVQA. Furthermore, a novel state space
model, termed Text-Conditioned State Space Model (TCSSM), is proposed. The
TCSSM framework is designed to leverage both bi-temporal imagery and
geo-disaster-related textual information in an unified manner to extract
domain-invariant features across domains. Input-dependent parameters existing
in TCSSM are dynamically predicted by using both bi-temporal images and
geo-disaster-related description, thereby facilitating the alignment between
bi-temporal visual data and the associated textual descriptions. Extensive
experiments are conducted to evaluate the proposed method against
state-of-the-art models, and superior performance is consistently demonstrated.
The code and dataset will be made publicly available upon acceptance at

TL;DR: TaoCache是一种无需训练、即插即用的缓存策略，通过固定点视角预测噪声输出，有效提升视频扩散模型的生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有缓存加速方法在跳过早期或中期去噪步骤时会导致结构差异，影响指令跟随和角色一致性。

Method: 采用固定点视角预测噪声输出，通过校准余弦相似度和范数比来保留高分辨率结构。

Result: 在多个数据集上，TaoCache在相同加速条件下显著优于现有缓存方法（LPIPS、SSIM、PSNR）。

Conclusion: TaoCache是一种高效且兼容性强的缓存策略，适用于视频扩散模型。

Abstract: Existing cache-based acceleration methods for video diffusion models
primarily skip early or mid denoising steps, which often leads to structural
discrepancies relative to full-timestep generation and can hinder instruction
following and character consistency. We present TaoCache, a training-free,
plug-and-play caching strategy that, instead of residual-based caching, adopts
a fixed-point perspective to predict the model's noise output and is
specifically effective in late denoising stages. By calibrating cosine
similarities and norm ratios of consecutive noise deltas, TaoCache preserves
high-resolution structure while enabling aggressive skipping. The approach is
orthogonal to complementary accelerations such as Pyramid Attention Broadcast
(PAB) and TeaCache, and it integrates seamlessly into DiT-based frameworks.

Conclusion: 预训练LLMs可作为颜色推荐的优秀工具，ColorGPT方法在多个任务中表现卓越。

Abstract: Colors play a crucial role in the design of vector graphic documents by
enhancing visual appeal, facilitating communication, improving usability, and
ensuring accessibility. In this context, color recommendation involves
suggesting appropriate colors to complete or refine a design when one or more
colors are missing or require alteration. Traditional methods often struggled
with these challenges due to the complex nature of color design and the limited
data availability. In this study, we explored the use of pretrained Large
Language Models (LLMs) and their commonsense reasoning capabilities for color
recommendation, raising the question: Can pretrained LLMs serve as superior
designers for color recommendation tasks? To investigate this, we developed a
robust, rigorously validated pipeline, ColorGPT, that was built by
systematically testing multiple color representations and applying effective
prompt engineering techniques. Our approach primarily targeted color palette
completion by recommending colors based on a set of given colors and
accompanying context. Moreover, our method can be extended to full palette
generation, producing an entire color palette corresponding to a provided
textual description. Experimental results demonstrated that our LLM-based
pipeline outperformed existing methods in terms of color suggestion accuracy
and the distribution of colors in the color palette completion task. For the
full palette generation task, our approach also yielded improvements in color
diversity and similarity compared to current techniques.

TL;DR: KFFocus提出了一种高效压缩视频令牌并突出关键帧信息的方法，通过动态采样和空间-时间建模提升视频LLMs的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频LLMs在压缩视频时忽略了关键帧的不均匀分布，可能导致重要信息丢失。

Result: 在长视频场景的实验中，KFFocus显著优于现有方法，提高了计算效率和准确性。

Conclusion: KFFocus通过优化视频令牌压缩和空间-时间建模，为视频LLMs提供了更高效和精确的解决方案。

Abstract: Recently, with the emergence of large language models, multimodal LLMs have
demonstrated exceptional capabilities in image and video modalities. Despite
advancements in video comprehension, the substantial computational demands of
long video sequences lead current video LLMs (Vid-LLMs) to employ compression
strategies at both the inter-frame level (e.g., uniform sampling of video
frames) and intra-frame level (e.g., condensing all visual tokens of each frame
into a limited number). However, this approach often neglects the uneven
temporal distribution of critical information across frames, risking the
omission of keyframes that contain essential temporal and semantic details. To
tackle these challenges, we propose KFFocus, a method designed to efficiently
compress video tokens and emphasize the informative context present within
video frames. We substitute uniform sampling with a refined approach inspired
by classic video compression principles to identify and capture keyframes based
on their temporal redundancy. By assigning varying condensation ratios to
frames based on their contextual relevance, KFFocus efficiently reduces token
redundancy while preserving informative content details. Additionally, we
introduce a spatiotemporal modeling module that encodes both the temporal
relationships between video frames and the spatial structure within each frame,
thus providing Vid-LLMs with a nuanced understanding of spatial-temporal
dynamics. Extensive experiments on widely recognized video understanding
benchmarks, especially long video scenarios, demonstrate that KFFocus
significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving substantial computational
efficiency and enhanced accuracy.

TL;DR: MSQ是一种多尺度量化方法，通过空间和时间维度的离散标记压缩运动序列，解决了现有运动表示在多尺度捕捉和组合灵活性上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有运动表示无法从多尺度捕捉运动且缺乏组合灵活性，限制了复杂模式建模和多样化生成任务的泛化能力。

Method: MSQ通过多尺度编码器捕捉不同空间粒度的身体部分，并在时间维度插值后量化成离散标记，基于此建立生成掩模模型。

Result: MSQ支持无缝组合运动标记，无需专门设计或重新训练，并在多个基准测试中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MSQ在多尺度运动表示和组合灵活性方面表现出色，为运动编辑、控制和生成提供了有效支持。

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in human motion generation, current motion
representations, typically formulated as discrete frame sequences, still face
two critical limitations: (i) they fail to capture motion from a multi-scale
perspective, limiting the capability in complex patterns modeling; (ii) they
lack compositional flexibility, which is crucial for model's generalization in
diverse generation tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce MSQ, a
novel quantization method that compresses the motion sequence into multi-scale
discrete tokens across spatial and temporal dimensions. MSQ employs distinct
encoders to capture body parts at varying spatial granularities and temporally
interpolates the encoded features into multiple scales before quantizing them
into discrete tokens. Building on this representation, we establish a
generative mask modeling model to effectively support motion editing, motion
control, and conditional motion generation. Through quantitative and
qualitative analysis, we show that our quantization method enables the seamless
composition of motion tokens without requiring specialized design or
re-training. Furthermore, extensive evaluations demonstrate that our approach
outperforms existing baseline methods on various benchmarks.

Conclusion: 通过组合小核扩展ERF并保持AGD是一种高效且有效的方法，UniConvNet在多种任务中表现出色，具有通用性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) with large effective receptive field
(ERF), still in their early stages, have demonstrated promising effectiveness
while constrained by high parameters and FLOPs costs and disrupted
asymptotically Gaussian distribution (AGD) of ERF. This paper proposes an
alternative paradigm: rather than merely employing extremely large ERF, it is
more effective and efficient to expand the ERF while maintaining AGD of ERF by
proper combination of smaller kernels, such as $7\times{7}$, $9\times{9}$,
$11\times{11}$. This paper introduces a Three-layer Receptive Field Aggregator
and designs a Layer Operator as the fundamental operator from the perspective
of receptive field. The ERF can be expanded to the level of existing
large-kernel ConvNets through the stack of proposed modules while maintaining
AGD of ERF. Using these designs, we propose a universal model for ConvNet of
any scale, termed UniConvNet. Extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K, COCO2017,
and ADE20K demonstrate that UniConvNet outperforms state-of-the-art CNNs and
ViTs across various vision recognition tasks for both lightweight and
large-scale models with comparable throughput. Surprisingly, UniConvNet-T
achieves $84.2\%$ ImageNet top-1 accuracy with $30M$ parameters and $5.1G$
FLOPs. UniConvNet-XL also shows competitive scalability to big data and large
models, acquiring $88.4\%$ top-1 accuracy on ImageNet. Code and models are

Motivation: 现有的Retinex深度学习方法在分解图像为光照和反射组件时，存在组件间残差（ICR），这些残差未被充分重视，影响了分解准确性和最终图像质量。

Result: 在三个低光基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法在定性和定量上均优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 通过减少ICR，IRetinex模型显著提升了低光图像增强的性能，为相关领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: In low-light image enhancement, Retinex-based deep learning methods have
garnered significant attention due to their exceptional interpretability. These
methods decompose images into mutually independent illumination and reflectance
components, allows each component to be enhanced separately. In fact, achieving
perfect decomposition of illumination and reflectance components proves to be
quite challenging, with some residuals still existing after decomposition. In
this paper, we formally name these residuals as inter-component residuals
(ICR), which has been largely underestimated by previous methods. In our
investigation, ICR not only affects the accuracy of the decomposition but also
causes enhanced components to deviate from the ideal outcome, ultimately
reducing the final synthesized image quality. To address this issue, we propose
a novel Inter-correction Retinex model (IRetinex) to alleviate ICR during the
decomposition and enhancement stage. In the decomposition stage, we leverage
inter-component residual reduction module to reduce the feature similarity
between illumination and reflectance components. In the enhancement stage, we
utilize the feature similarity between the two components to detect and
mitigate the impact of ICR within each enhancement unit. Extensive experiments
on three low-light benchmark datasets demonstrated that by reducing ICR, our
method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches both qualitatively and
quantitatively.

Conclusion: UC-Seg通过双子网协作和不确定性感知策略，有效解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning has gained considerable popularity in medical image
segmentation tasks due to its capability to reduce reliance on expert-examined
annotations. Several mean-teacher (MT) based semi-supervised methods utilize
consistency regularization to effectively leverage valuable information from
unlabeled data. However, these methods often heavily rely on the student model
and overlook the potential impact of cognitive biases within the model.
Furthermore, some methods employ co-training using pseudo-labels derived from
different inputs, yet generating high-confidence pseudo-labels from perturbed
inputs during training remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we
propose an Uncertainty-aware Cross-training framework for semi-supervised
medical image Segmentation (UC-Seg). Our UC-Seg framework incorporates two
distinct subnets to effectively explore and leverage the correlation between
them, thereby mitigating cognitive biases within the model. Specifically, we
present a Cross-subnet Consistency Preservation (CCP) strategy to enhance
feature representation capability and ensure feature consistency across the two
subnets. This strategy enables each subnet to correct its own biases and learn
shared semantics from both labeled and unlabeled data. Additionally, we propose
an Uncertainty-aware Pseudo-label Generation (UPG) component that leverages
segmentation results and corresponding uncertainty maps from both subnets to
generate high-confidence pseudo-labels. We extensively evaluate the proposed
UC-Seg on various medical image segmentation tasks involving different modality
images, such as MRI, CT, ultrasound, colonoscopy, and so on. The results
demonstrate that our method achieves superior segmentation accuracy and
generalization performance compared to other state-of-the-art semi-supervised
methods. Our code will be released at https://github.com/taozh2017/UCSeg.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度伪造检测方法依赖标注数据，但AI生成内容越来越逼真，标注变得耗时且不可靠，需有效利用无标注数据。

Method: DPGNet包含文本引导的跨域对齐和课程驱动的伪标签生成模块，通过知识蒸馏防止灾难性遗忘。

Result: 在11个数据集上，DPGNet比现有方法性能提升6.3%。

Conclusion: DPGNet有效利用无标注数据，解决了深度伪造检测中的标注挑战。

Abstract: Existing deepfake detection methods heavily depend on labeled training data.
However, as AI-generated content becomes increasingly realistic, even
\textbf{human annotators struggle to distinguish} between deepfakes and
authentic images. This makes the labeling process both time-consuming and less
reliable. Specifically, there is a growing demand for approaches that can
effectively utilize large-scale unlabeled data from online social networks.
Unlike typical unsupervised learning tasks, where categories are distinct,
AI-generated faces closely mimic real image distributions and share strong
similarities, causing performance drop in conventional strategies. In this
paper, we introduce the Dual-Path Guidance Network (DPGNet), to tackle two key
challenges: (1) bridging the domain gap between faces from different generation
models, and (2) utilizing unlabeled image samples. The method features two core
modules: text-guided cross-domain alignment, which uses learnable prompts to
unify visual and textual embeddings into a domain-invariant feature space, and
curriculum-driven pseudo label generation, which dynamically exploit more
informative unlabeled samples. To prevent catastrophic forgetting, we also
facilitate bridging between domains via cross-domain knowledge distillation.
Extensive experiments on \textbf{11 popular datasets}, show that DPGNet
outperforms SoTA approaches by \textbf{6.3\%}, highlighting its effectiveness
in leveraging unlabeled data to address the annotation challenges posed by the
increasing realism of deepfakes.

Abstract: Visual concept learning, also known as Text-to-image personalization, is the
process of teaching new concepts to a pretrained model. This has numerous
applications from product placement to entertainment and personalized design.
Here we show that many existing methods can be substantially augmented by
adding a personalization step that is (1) specific to the prompt and noise
seed, and (2) using two loss terms based on the self- and cross- attention,
capturing the identity of the personalized concept. Specifically, we leverage
PDM features -- previously designed to capture identity -- and show how they
can be used to improve personalized semantic similarity. We evaluate the
benefit that our method gains on top of six different personalization methods,
and several base text-to-image models (both UNet- and DiT-based). We find
significant improvements even over previous per-query personalization methods.

Result: 在模拟真实场景中，EBI（误差平衡指数）达到68.91，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了视频异常检测在动态环境中的适用性。

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) can play a key role in spotting unusual
activities in video footage. VAD is difficult to use in real-world settings due
to the dynamic nature of human actions, environmental variations, and domain
shifts. Traditional evaluation metrics often prove inadequate for such
scenarios, as they rely on static assumptions and fall short of identifying a
threshold that distinguishes normal from anomalous behavior in dynamic
settings. To address this, we introduce an active learning framework tailored
for VAD, designed for adapting to the ever-changing real-world conditions. Our
approach leverages active learning to continuously select the most informative
data points for labeling, thereby enhancing model adaptability. A critical
innovation is the incorporation of a human-in-the-loop mechanism, which enables
the identification of actual normal and anomalous instances from
pseudo-labeling results generated by AI. This collected data allows the
framework to define an adaptive threshold tailored to different environments,
ensuring that the system remains effective as the definition of 'normal' shifts
across various settings. Implemented within a lab-based framework that
simulates real-world conditions, our approach allows rigorous testing and
refinement of VAD algorithms with a new metric. Experimental results show that
our method achieves an EBI (Error Balance Index) of 68.91 for Q3 in real-world
simulated scenarios, demonstrating its practical effectiveness and
significantly enhancing the applicability of VAD in dynamic environments.

Motivation: 解决自动驾驶系统中开放集感知的挑战，特别是在识别未见过的物体类别时，确保安全性。

Method: 提出VLM-3D框架，结合LoRA高效适应VLMs，并设计联合语义-几何损失（早期使用语义损失，后期引入3D IoU损失）。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上，感知精度提升12.8%。

Conclusion: VLM-3D通过端到端设计和联合损失，有效提升了自动驾驶场景中的3D感知能力。

Abstract: Open-set perception in complex traffic environments poses a critical
challenge for autonomous driving systems, particularly in identifying
previously unseen object categories, which is vital for ensuring safety. Visual
Language Models (VLMs), with their rich world knowledge and strong semantic
reasoning capabilities, offer new possibilities for addressing this task.
However, existing approaches typically leverage VLMs to extract visual features
and couple them with traditional object detectors, resulting in multi-stage
error propagation that hinders perception accuracy. To overcome this
limitation, we propose VLM-3D, the first end-to-end framework that enables VLMs
to perform 3D geometric perception in autonomous driving scenarios. VLM-3D
incorporates Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to efficiently adapt VLMs to driving
tasks with minimal computational overhead, and introduces a joint
semantic-geometric loss design: token-level semantic loss is applied during
early training to ensure stable convergence, while 3D IoU loss is introduced in
later stages to refine the accuracy of 3D bounding box predictions. Evaluations
on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that the proposed joint semantic-geometric
loss in VLM-3D leads to a 12.8% improvement in perception accuracy, fully
validating the effectiveness and advancement of our method.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) highlight a strong connection
between intelligence and compression. Learned image compression, a fundamental
task in modern data compression, has made significant progress in recent years.
However, current models remain limited in scale, restricting their
representation capacity, and how scaling model size influences compression
performance remains unexplored. In this work, we present a pioneering study on
scaling up learned image compression models and revealing the performance
trends through scaling laws. Using the recent state-of-the-art HPCM model as
baseline, we scale model parameters from 68.5 millions to 1 billion and fit
power-law relations between test loss and key scaling variables, including
model size and optimal training compute. The results reveal a scaling trend,
enabling extrapolation to larger scale models. Experimental results demonstrate
that the scaled-up HPCM-1B model achieves state-of-the-art rate-distortion
performance. We hope this work inspires future exploration of large-scale
compression models and deeper investigations into the connection between
compression and intelligence.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable success on multimodal
tasks such as image-text retrieval and zero-shot classification, yet they can
exhibit demographic biases even when explicit protected attributes are absent
during training. In this work, we focus on automated glaucoma screening from
retinal fundus images, a critical application given that glaucoma is a leading
cause of irreversible blindness and disproportionately affects underserved
populations. Building on a reweighting-based contrastive learning framework, we
introduce an attribute-agnostic debiasing method that (i) infers proxy
subgroups via unsupervised clustering of image-image embeddings, (ii) computes
gradient-similarity weights between the CLIP-style multimodal loss and a
SimCLR-style image-pair contrastive loss, and (iii) applies these weights in a
joint, top-$k$ weighted objective to upweight underperforming clusters. This
label-free approach adaptively targets the hardest examples, thereby reducing
subgroup disparities. We evaluate our method on the Harvard FairVLMed glaucoma
subset, reporting Equalized Odds Distance (EOD), Equalized Subgroup AUC (ES
AUC), and Groupwise AUC to demonstrate equitable performance across inferred
demographic subgroups.

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving landscape of digital security, biometric
authentication systems, particularly facial recognition, have emerged as
integral components of various security protocols. However, the reliability of
these systems is compromised by sophisticated spoofing attacks, where imposters
gain unauthorized access by falsifying biometric traits. Current literature

This study introduces a robust solution through novel deep learning models
addressing the deficiencies in contemporary anti-spoofing techniques. By
innovatively integrating texture analysis and reflective properties associated
with genuine human traits, our models distinguish authentic presence from
replicas with remarkable precision. Extensive evaluations were conducted across
five diverse datasets, encompassing a wide range of attack vectors and
environmental conditions. Results demonstrate substantial advancement over
existing systems, with our best model (AttackNet V2.2) achieving 99.9% average
accuracy when trained on combined data. Moreover, our research unveils critical
insights into the behavioral patterns of impostor attacks, contributing to a
more nuanced understanding of their evolving nature. The implications are
profound: our models do not merely fortify the authentication processes but
also instill confidence in biometric systems across various sectors reliant on
secure access.

Conclusion: Turbo-VAED首次实现移动设备上的实时720p视频VAE解码，适用于多数视频VAE，具有高效、低成本的优势。

Abstract: There is a growing demand for deploying large generative AI models on mobile
devices. For recent popular video generative models, however, the Variational
AutoEncoder (VAE) represents one of the major computational bottlenecks. Both
large parameter sizes and mismatched kernels cause out-of-memory errors or
extremely slow inference on mobile devices. To address this, we propose a
low-cost solution that efficiently transfers widely used video VAEs to mobile
devices. (1) We analyze redundancy in existing VAE architectures and get
empirical design insights. By integrating 3D depthwise separable convolutions
into our model, we significantly reduce the number of parameters. (2) We
observe that the upsampling techniques in mainstream video VAEs are poorly
suited to mobile hardware and form the main bottleneck. In response, we propose
a decoupled 3D pixel shuffle scheme that slashes end-to-end delay. Building
upon these, we develop a universal mobile-oriented VAE decoder, Turbo-VAED. (3)
We propose an efficient VAE decoder training method. Since only the decoder is
used during deployment, we distill it to Turbo-VAED instead of retraining the
full VAE, enabling fast mobile adaptation with minimal performance loss. To our
knowledge, our method enables real-time 720p video VAE decoding on mobile
devices for the first time. This approach is widely applicable to most video
VAEs. When integrated into four representative models, with training cost as

TL;DR: HumanOLAT数据集填补了公开高质量全人体多视角单光源（OLAT）数据的空白，支持复杂光照和视角合成的研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 缺乏公开的高质量全人体多视角光照数据集，限制了数字人体重光照和新视角渲染的研究进展。

Method: 提出HumanOLAT数据集，包含多视角OLAT捕捉的全人体数据，涵盖多种光照条件（如白光、环境光、颜色渐变等）。

Result: 评估现有方法表明数据集的价值，同时揭示了建模复杂人-光交互的挑战。

Conclusion: HumanOLAT将推动重光照和渲染技术的基准测试与研究进展。

Abstract: Simultaneous relighting and novel-view rendering of digital human
representations is an important yet challenging task with numerous
applications. Progress in this area has been significantly limited due to the
lack of publicly available, high-quality datasets, especially for full-body
human captures. To address this critical gap, we introduce the HumanOLAT
dataset, the first publicly accessible large-scale dataset of multi-view
One-Light-at-a-Time (OLAT) captures of full-body humans. The dataset includes
HDR RGB frames under various illuminations, such as white light, environment
maps, color gradients and fine-grained OLAT illuminations. Our evaluations of
state-of-the-art relighting and novel-view synthesis methods underscore both
the dataset's value and the significant challenges still present in modeling
complex human-centric appearance and lighting interactions. We believe
HumanOLAT will significantly facilitate future research, enabling rigorous
benchmarking and advancements in both general and human-specific relighting and
rendering techniques.

TL;DR: SharpXR是一种结构感知的双解码器U-Net，用于在低剂量儿科X射线中降噪并保留诊断相关特征，显著提升诊断准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在资源匮乏地区，低剂量儿科X射线因噪声问题影响诊断准确性，传统降噪方法会损失细节。

Method: SharpXR结合拉普拉斯引导的边缘保留解码器和可学习融合模块，模拟Poisson-Gaussian噪声进行训练。

Result: SharpXR在所有评估指标上优于现有方法，并将肺炎分类准确率从88.8%提升至92.5%。

Conclusion: SharpXR在低资源儿科护理中具有显著诊断价值，且计算高效。

Abstract: Pediatric chest X-ray imaging is essential for early diagnosis, particularly
in low-resource settings where advanced imaging modalities are often
inaccessible. Low-dose protocols reduce radiation exposure in children but
introduce substantial noise that can obscure critical anatomical details.
Conventional denoising methods often degrade fine details, compromising
diagnostic accuracy. In this paper, we present SharpXR, a structure-aware
dual-decoder U-Net designed to denoise low-dose pediatric X-rays while
preserving diagnostically relevant features. SharpXR combines a
Laplacian-guided edge-preserving decoder with a learnable fusion module that
adaptively balances noise suppression and structural detail retention. To
address the scarcity of paired training data, we simulate realistic
Poisson-Gaussian noise on the Pediatric Pneumonia Chest X-ray dataset. SharpXR
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across all evaluation metrics while
maintaining computational efficiency suitable for resource-constrained
settings. SharpXR-denoised images improved downstream pneumonia classification
accuracy from 88.8% to 92.5%, underscoring its diagnostic value in low-resource
pediatric care.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 室内光照估计因场景光照时空变化而极具挑战性，需解决单图像或视频的照明估计问题。

Method: 基于预训练图像扩散模型，通过联合修复多个铬球作为光探针，优化MLP表示的光场。

Result: 在单图像或视频的室内光照估计中表现优异，尤其在时空一致性光照估计上优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在野外视频中实现了时空一致的光照估计，填补了先前研究的空白。

Abstract: Indoor lighting estimation from a single image or video remains a challenge
due to its highly ill-posed nature, especially when the lighting condition of
the scene varies spatially and temporally. We propose a method that estimates
from an input video a continuous light field describing the spatiotemporally
varying lighting of the scene. We leverage 2D diffusion priors for optimizing
such light field represented as a MLP. To enable zero-shot generalization to
in-the-wild scenes, we fine-tune a pre-trained image diffusion model to predict
lighting at multiple locations by jointly inpainting multiple chrome balls as
light probes. We evaluate our method on indoor lighting estimation from a
single image or video and show superior performance over compared baselines.
Most importantly, we highlight results on spatiotemporally consistent lighting
estimation from in-the-wild videos, which is rarely demonstrated in previous
works.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决面部表情重定向中语义识别和框架转换的困难，特别是在游戏或VR环境中从真人到虚拟角色的重定向问题。

Method: 使用相同的面部框架，结合体积变形和Simon-Says表达式校准，并通过微调方法优化跟踪器的输出。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了面部表情重定向中的语义问题，特别适用于游戏和VR环境中的虚拟角色重定向。

Abstract: In this paper, we consider retargeting a tracked facial performance to either
another person or to a virtual character in a game or virtual reality (VR)
environment. We remove the difficulties associated with identifying and
retargeting the semantics of one rig framework to another by utilizing the same
framework (3DMM, FLAME, MetaHuman, etc.) for both subjects. Although this does
not constrain the choice of framework when retargeting from one person to
another, it does force the tracker to use the game/VR character rig when
retargeting to a game/VR character. We utilize volumetric morphing in order to
fit facial rigs to both performers and targets; in addition, a carefully chosen
set of Simon-Says expressions is used to calibrate each rig to the motion
signatures of the relevant performer or target. Although a uniform set of
Simon-Says expressions can likely be used for all person to person retargeting,
we argue that person to game/VR character retargeting benefits from Simon-Says
expressions that capture the distinct motion signature of the game/VR character
rig. The Simon-Says calibrated rigs tend to produce the desired expressions
when exercising animation controls (as expected). Unfortunately, these
well-calibrated rigs still lead to undesirable controls when tracking a
performance (a well-behaved function can have an arbitrarily ill-conditioned
inverse), even though they typically produce acceptable geometry
reconstructions. Thus, we propose a fine-tuning approach that modifies the rig
used by the tracker in order to promote the output of more semantically
meaningful animation controls, facilitating high efficacy retargeting. In order
to better address real-world scenarios, the fine-tuning relies on implicit
differentiation so that the tracker can be treated as a (potentially
non-differentiable) black box.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有点云滤波方法存在点聚类或噪声残留问题，需要一种更有效的方法来结合短程和远程信息以提升去噪效果。

Method: 设计了并行模块ShortModule和LongModule，分别处理短程分数和远程流，并采用动态图卷积解码器优化推理过程。

Result: 实验表明HybridPF在去噪效果和推理速度上达到最优水平。

Conclusion: HybridPF通过结合短程和远程信息，显著提升了点云滤波的性能和效率。

Abstract: Point cloud capture processes are error-prone and introduce noisy artifacts
that necessitate filtering/denoising. Recent filtering methods often suffer
from point clustering or noise retaining issues. In this paper, we propose
Hybrid Point Cloud Filtering ($\textbf{HybridPF}$) that considers both
short-range and long-range filtering trajectories when removing noise. It is
well established that short range scores, given by $\nabla_{x}\log p(x_t)$, may
provide the necessary displacements to move noisy points to the underlying
clean surface. By contrast, long range velocity flows approximate constant
displacements directed from a high noise variant patch $x_0$ towards the
corresponding clean surface $x_1$. Here, noisy patches $x_t$ are viewed as
intermediate states between the high noise variant and the clean patches. Our
intuition is that long range information from velocity flow models can guide
the short range scores to align more closely with the clean points. In turn,
score models generally provide a quicker convergence to the clean surface.
Specifically, we devise two parallel modules, the ShortModule and LongModule,
each consisting of an Encoder-Decoder pair to respectively account for
short-range scores and long-range flows. We find that short-range scores,
guided by long-range features, yield filtered point clouds with good point
distributions and convergence near the clean surface. We design a joint loss
function to simultaneously train the ShortModule and LongModule, in an
end-to-end manner. Finally, we identify a key weakness in current displacement
based methods, limitations on the decoder architecture, and propose a dynamic
graph convolutional decoder to improve the inference process. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that our HybridPF achieves state-of-the-art results
while enabling faster inference speed.

Abstract: This paper presents a study of computation and morphology of Louis Kahn City
Tower project. The City Tower is an unbuilt design by Louis I. Kahn and Anne
Tyng that integrates form and structure using 3D space triangular geometries.
Although never built, the City Tower geometrical framework anticipated later
developments in design of space-frame structures. Initially envisioned in the
1950s, the City Tower project is a skyscraper structure based on a tetrahedral
and octahedral space frame called Octet-Truss. The aim of this study is to
analyze the geometry of the City Tower structure and how it can be used to
develop modular and adaptable architectural forms. The study is based on an
analytical shape grammar that is used to recreate the original structure, and
later to generate new structural configurations based on the City Tower's
morphology. This study also investigates the potential applications of these
findings in architecture and reveals the possibilities of using tetrahedrons
and octahedrons as fundamental geometries for creating scalable and modular
designs and presents initial findings.

Abstract: This paper presents a study on using Radiolaria as a basis for generation of
space-based geometry for structural design with shape grammars. Radiolaria has
been a source of inspiration for architectural design with its intricate
structural features and geometric patterns (Lim, 2012). We use the basis of the
Radiolaria geometry to create a generative shape grammar as a computational
system; then use the shape grammar to create spatial configurations for
potential applications in design of 3D space structural frames. This study
begins with the geometric analysis of Radiolaria and the dissection of its
structure and geometry into a simplified morphological source, in this case a
tetrahedral structure. Tetrahedrons are used in combination with octahedrons to
generate spatial configurations to generate 3D spatial structural frames. The
paper presents the Radiolaria spatial analysis, the shape grammar, the
collection of generated designs, and possible applications in space frame
structures.

Conclusion: 该方法实现了更精细和可控的图像色彩化过程。

Abstract: With the advent of diffusion models, Text-to-Image (T2I) generation has seen
substantial advancements. Current T2I models allow users to specify object
colors using linguistic color names, and some methods aim to personalize
color-object association through prompt learning. However, existing models
struggle to provide comprehensive control over the color schemes of an entire
image, especially for background elements and less prominent objects not
explicitly mentioned in prompts. This paper proposes a novel approach to
enhance color scheme control by integrating color palettes as a separate
guidance mechanism alongside prompt instructions. We investigate the
effectiveness of palette guidance by exploring various palette representation
methods within a diffusion-based image colorization framework. To facilitate
this exploration, we construct specialized palette-text-image datasets and
conduct extensive quantitative and qualitative analyses. Our results
demonstrate that incorporating palette guidance significantly improves the
model's ability to generate images with desired color schemes, enabling a more
controlled and refined colorization process.

Abstract: Real-time rendering with global illumination is crucial to afford the user
realistic experience in virtual environments. We present a learning-based
estimator to predict diffuse indirect illumination in screen space, which then
is combined with direct illumination to synthesize globally-illuminated high
dynamic range (HDR) results. Our approach tackles the challenges of capturing
long-range/long-distance indirect illumination when employing neural networks
and is generalized to handle complex lighting and scenarios.
  From the neural network thinking of the solver to the rendering equation, we
present a novel network architecture to predict indirect illumination. Our
network is equipped with a modified attention mechanism that aggregates global
information guided by spacial geometry features, as well as a monochromatic
design that encodes each color channel individually.
  We conducted extensive evaluations, and the experimental results demonstrate
our superiority over previous learning-based techniques. Our approach excels at
handling complex lighting such as varying-colored lighting and environment
lighting. It can successfully capture distant indirect illumination and
simulates the interreflections between textured surfaces well (i.e., color
bleeding effects); it can also effectively handle new scenes that are not
present in the training dataset.

Conclusion: DiffPhysCam为视觉感知和机器人训练提供了高效工具，支持仿真到现实的迁移。

Abstract: We introduce DiffPhysCam, a differentiable camera simulator designed to
support robotics and embodied AI applications by enabling gradient-based
optimization in visual perception pipelines. Generating synthetic images that
closely mimic those from real cameras is essential for training visual models
and enabling end-to-end visuomotor learning. Moreover, differentiable rendering
allows inverse reconstruction of real-world scenes as digital twins,
facilitating simulation-based robotics training. However, existing virtual
cameras offer limited control over intrinsic settings, poorly capture optical
artifacts, and lack tunable calibration parameters -- hindering sim-to-real
transfer. DiffPhysCam addresses these limitations through a multi-stage
pipeline that provides fine-grained control over camera settings, models key
optical effects such as defocus blur, and supports calibration with real-world
data. It enables both forward rendering for image synthesis and inverse
rendering for 3D scene reconstruction, including mesh and material texture
optimization. We show that DiffPhysCam enhances robotic perception performance
in synthetic image tasks. As an illustrative example, we create a digital twin
of a real-world scene using inverse rendering, simulate it in a multi-physics
environment, and demonstrate navigation of an autonomous ground vehicle using
images generated by DiffPhysCam.

Motivation: 现有头部旋转预测算法忽视认知动机，导致虚拟代理行为不真实。SCORE旨在解决这一问题。

Method: SCORE结合VLM和LLM，离线推理动机驱动（兴趣、信息寻求等），在线验证以抑制幻觉。

Result: SCORE能预测头部旋转的动机和行为，适用于未见场景和多代理群体。

Conclusion: SCORE提升了虚拟代理行为的真实性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Natural head rotation is critical for believable embodied virtual agents, yet
this micro-level behavior remains largely underexplored. While head-rotation
prediction algorithms could, in principle, reproduce this behavior, they
typically focus on visually salient stimuli and overlook the cognitive motives
that guide head rotation. This yields agents that look at conspicuous objects
while overlooking obstacles or task-relevant cues, diminishing realism in a
virtual environment. We introduce SCORE, a Symbolic Cognitive Reasoning
framework for Embodied Head Rotation, a data-agnostic framework that produces
context-aware head movements without task-specific training or hand-tuned
heuristics. A controlled VR study (N=20) identifies five motivational drivers
of human head movements: Interest, Information Seeking, Safety, Social Schema,
and Habit. SCORE encodes these drivers as symbolic predicates, perceives the
scene with a Vision-Language Model (VLM), and plans head poses with a Large
Language Model (LLM). The framework employs a hybrid workflow: the VLM-LLM
reasoning is executed offline, after which a lightweight FastVLM performs
online validation to suppress hallucinations while maintaining responsiveness
to scene dynamics. The result is an agent that predicts not only where to look
but also why, generalizing to unseen scenes and multi-agent crowds while
retaining behavioral plausibility.

Abstract: We introduce VertexRegen, a novel mesh generation framework that enables
generation at a continuous level of detail. Existing autoregressive methods
generate meshes in a partial-to-complete manner and thus intermediate steps of
generation represent incomplete structures. VertexRegen takes inspiration from
progressive meshes and reformulates the process as the reversal of edge
collapse, i.e. vertex split, learned through a generative model. Experimental
results demonstrate that VertexRegen produces meshes of comparable quality to
state-of-the-art methods while uniquely offering anytime generation with the
flexibility to halt at any step to yield valid meshes with varying levels of
detail.

Conclusion: ColorCtrl在编辑质量和一致性上达到最先进水平，适用于多种扩散模型。

Abstract: Text-guided color editing in images and videos is a fundamental yet unsolved
problem, requiring fine-grained manipulation of color attributes, including
albedo, light source color, and ambient lighting, while preserving physical
consistency in geometry, material properties, and light-matter interactions.
Existing training-free methods offer broad applicability across editing tasks
but struggle with precise color control and often introduce visual
inconsistency in both edited and non-edited regions. In this work, we present
ColorCtrl, a training-free color editing method that leverages the attention
mechanisms of modern Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformers (MM-DiT). By
disentangling structure and color through targeted manipulation of attention
maps and value tokens, our method enables accurate and consistent color
editing, along with word-level control of attribute intensity. Our method
modifies only the intended regions specified by the prompt, leaving unrelated
areas untouched. Extensive experiments on both SD3 and FLUX.1-dev demonstrate
that ColorCtrl outperforms existing training-free approaches and achieves
state-of-the-art performances in both edit quality and consistency.
Furthermore, our method surpasses strong commercial models such as FLUX.1
Kontext Max and GPT-4o Image Generation in terms of consistency. When extended
to video models like CogVideoX, our approach exhibits greater advantages,
particularly in maintaining temporal coherence and editing stability. Finally,
our method also generalizes to instruction-based editing diffusion models such
as Step1X-Edit and FLUX.1 Kontext dev, further demonstrating its versatility.

Conclusion: 该架构为高自由度机器人实现复杂动态运动提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Endowing humanoid robots with the ability to perform highly dynamic motions
akin to human-level acrobatics has been a long-standing challenge. Successfully
performing these maneuvers requires close consideration of the underlying
physics in both trajectory optimization for planning and control during
execution. This is particularly challenging due to humanoids' high
degree-of-freedom count and associated exponentially scaling complexities,
which makes planning on the explicit equations of motion intractable. Typical
workarounds include linearization methods and model approximations. However,
neither are sufficient because they produce degraded performance on the true
robotic system. This paper presents a control architecture comprising
trajectory optimization and whole-body control, intermediated by a matching
model abstraction, that enables the execution of acrobatic maneuvers, including
constraint and posture behaviors, conditioned on the unabbreviated equations of
motion of the articulated rigid body model. A review of underlying modeling and
control methods is given, followed by implementation details including model
abstraction, trajectory optimization and whole-body controller. The system's
effectiveness is analyzed in simulation.

Conclusion: 这是首次将Koopman算子理论应用于四足机器人LMPC的研究，展示了其有效性。

Abstract: Online optimal control of quadruped robots would enable them to adapt to
varying inputs and changing conditions in real time. A common way of achieving
this is linear model predictive control (LMPC), where a quadratic programming
(QP) problem is formulated over a finite horizon with a quadratic cost and
linear constraints obtained by linearizing the equations of motion and solved
on the fly. However, the model linearization may lead to model inaccuracies. In
this paper, we use the Koopman operator to create a linear model of the
quadrupedal system in high dimensional space which preserves the nonlinearity
of the equations of motion. Then using LMPC, we demonstrate high fidelity
tracking and disturbance rejection on a quadrupedal robot. This is the first
work that uses the Koopman operator theory for LMPC of quadrupedal locomotion.

often lead to collisions and deadlocks. We introduce eIFP-MPC, an optimized and
extended version of IFP that improves robustness and path consistency in dense,
dynamic environments. The method refines threat prioritization using a
time-to-collision heuristic, stabilizes path generation through cost-based
via-point selection, and ensures dynamic feasibility by incorporating model
predictive control (MPC) into the planning process. These enhancements are
tightly integrated into the IFP to preserve its efficiency while improving its
adaptability and stability. Extensive simulations across symmetric and
high-density scenarios show that eIFP-MPC significantly reduces oscillations,
ensures collision-free motion, and improves trajectory efficiency. The results
demonstrate that geometric planners can be strengthened through optimization,
enabling robust performance at scale in complex multi-agent environments.

TL;DR: 论文提出了首个大规模EMG到肌腱控制数据集，用于解决肌腱驱动机械手控制中的复杂映射问题，并提出了扩散回归模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肌腱驱动机械手缺乏运动捕捉数据与肌腱控制的直接映射，且视觉跟踪方法易受遮挡和不准确影响，sEMG传感器提供了一种替代方案，但现有方法存在局限性。

Method: 扩展了emg2pose数据集，包含193名受试者的370小时数据，提供肌腱控制信号，并提出了扩散回归模型。

Result: 建立了首个EMG到肌腱控制的大规模数据集，并通过基线模型和扩散模型展示了其有效性。

Conclusion: 该数据集和模型框架为肌腱驱动机械手的精确控制奠定了基础，推动了相关研究的发展。

Abstract: Tendon-driven robotic hands offer unparalleled dexterity for manipulation
tasks, but learning control policies for such systems presents unique
challenges. Unlike joint-actuated robotic hands, tendon-driven systems lack a
direct one-to-one mapping between motion capture (mocap) data and tendon
controls, making the learning process complex and expensive. Additionally,
visual tracking methods for real-world applications are prone to occlusions and
inaccuracies, further complicating joint tracking. Wrist-wearable surface
electromyography (sEMG) sensors present an inexpensive, robust alternative to
capture hand motion. However, mapping sEMG signals to tendon control remains a
significant challenge despite the availability of EMG-to-pose data sets and
regression-based models in the existing literature.
  We introduce the first large-scale EMG-to-Tendon Control dataset for robotic
hands, extending the emg2pose dataset, which includes recordings from 193
subjects, spanning 370 hours and 29 stages with diverse gestures. This dataset
incorporates tendon control signals derived using the MyoSuite MyoHand model,
addressing limitations such as invalid poses in prior methods. We provide three
baseline regression models to demonstrate emg2tendon utility and propose a
novel diffusion-based regression model for predicting tendon control from sEMG
recordings. This dataset and modeling framework marks a significant step
forward for tendon-driven dexterous robotic manipulation, laying the groundwork
for scalable and accurate tendon control in robotic hands.

Abstract: Efficient mobility and power consumption are critical for autonomous water
surface robots in long-term water environmental monitoring. This study develops
and evaluates a transformable mobility mechanism for a water surface robot with
two control modes: station-keeping and traveling to improve energy efficiency
and maneuverability. Field experiments show that, in a round-trip task between
two points, the traveling mode reduces power consumption by 10\% and decreases
the total time required for travel by 5\% compared to the station-keeping mode.
These results confirm the effectiveness of the transformable mobility mechanism
for enhancing operational efficiency in patrolling on water surface.

Abstract: Quadrupedal robots with manipulators offer strong mobility and adaptability
for grasping in unstructured, dynamic environments through coordinated
whole-body control. However, existing research has predominantly focused on
static-object grasping, neglecting the challenges posed by dynamic targets and
thus limiting applicability in dynamic scenarios such as logistics sorting and
human-robot collaboration. To address this, we introduce DQ-Bench, a new
benchmark that systematically evaluates dynamic grasping across varying object
motions, velocities, heights, object types, and terrain complexities, along
with comprehensive evaluation metrics. Building upon this benchmark, we propose
DQ-Net, a compact teacher-student framework designed to infer grasp
configurations from limited perceptual cues. During training, the teacher
network leverages privileged information to holistically model both the static
geometric properties and dynamic motion characteristics of the target, and
integrates a grasp fusion module to deliver robust guidance for motion
planning. Concurrently, we design a lightweight student network that performs
dual-viewpoint temporal modeling using only the target mask, depth map, and
proprioceptive state, enabling closed-loop action outputs without reliance on
privileged data. Extensive experiments on DQ-Bench demonstrate that DQ-Net
achieves robust dynamic objects grasping across multiple task settings,
substantially outperforming baseline methods in both success rate and
responsiveness.

Method: 提出基于相对位置、速度和局部密度的模型，引入空间偏移和动力学偏移两个可调参数。

Result: 模型实现了灵活、无碰撞的群体行为，并扩展至认知自主系统，支持能量感知的相变。

Conclusion: 该模型为多机器人系统（如自主空中群体）提供了鲁棒的基础。

Abstract: Collective behaviors such as swarming and flocking emerge from simple,
decentralized interactions in biological systems. Existing models, such as
Vicsek and Cucker-Smale, lack collision avoidance, whereas the Olfati-Saber
model imposes rigid formations, limiting their applicability in swarm robotics.
To address these limitations, this paper proposes a minimal yet expressive
model that governs agent dynamics using relative positions, velocities, and
local density, modulated by two tunable parameters: the spatial offset and
kinetic offset. The model achieves spatially flexible, collision-free behaviors
that reflect naturalistic group dynamics. Furthermore, we extend the framework
to cognitive autonomous systems, enabling energy-aware phase transitions
between swarming and flocking through adaptive control parameter tuning. This
cognitively inspired approach offers a robust foundation for real-world
applications in multi-robot systems, particularly autonomous aerial swarms.

Abstract: Zoomorphic robots could serve as accessible and practical alternatives for
users unable or unwilling to keep pets. However, their affective interactions
are often simplistic and short-lived, limiting their potential for domestic
adoption. In order to facilitate more dynamic and nuanced affective
interactions and relationships between users and zoomorphic robots we present
AZRA, a novel augmented reality (AR) framework that extends the affective
capabilities of these robots without physical modifications. To demonstrate
AZRA, we augment a zoomorphic robot, Petit Qoobo, with novel emotional displays
(face, light, sound, thought bubbles) and interaction modalities (voice, touch,
proximity, gaze). Additionally, AZRA features a computational model of emotion
to calculate the robot's emotional responses, daily moods, evolving personality
and needs. We highlight how AZRA can be used for rapid participatory
prototyping and enhancing existing robots, then discuss implications on future
zoomorphic robot development.

Abstract: We introduce DeepFleet, a suite of foundation models designed to support
coordination and planning for large-scale mobile robot fleets. These models are
trained on fleet movement data, including robot positions, goals, and
interactions, from hundreds of thousands of robots in Amazon warehouses
worldwide. DeepFleet consists of four architectures that each embody a distinct
inductive bias and collectively explore key points in the design space for
multi-agent foundation models: the robot-centric (RC) model is an
autoregressive decision transformer operating on neighborhoods of individual
robots; the robot-floor (RF) model uses a transformer with cross-attention
between robots and the warehouse floor; the image-floor (IF) model applies
convolutional encoding to a multi-channel image representation of the full
fleet; and the graph-floor (GF) model combines temporal attention with graph
neural networks for spatial relationships. In this paper, we describe these
models and present our evaluation of the impact of these design choices on
prediction task performance. We find that the robot-centric and graph-floor
models, which both use asynchronous robot state updates and incorporate the
localized structure of robot interactions, show the most promise. We also
present experiments that show that these two models can make effective use of
larger warehouses operation datasets as the models are scaled up.

while in use in construction can be simulated in the virtual model. Calibration
makes this simulation of high-fidelity which can enhance realistic planning for

uses LIDAR for object and collision avoideance and does not need to move on a

Conclusion: GSMR和GSCLO为机器人混合现实系统提供了一种高效、低成本的通信解决方案，动态场景中混合数据有助于提升性能。

Abstract: Realizing low-cost communication in robotic mixed reality (RoboMR) systems
presents a challenge, due to the necessity of uploading high-resolution images
through wireless channels. This paper proposes Gaussian splatting (GS) RoboMR
(GSMR), which enables the simulator to opportunistically render a
photo-realistic view from the robot's pose by calling ``memory'' from a GS
model, thus reducing the need for excessive image uploads. However, the GS
model may involve discrepancies compared to the actual environments. To this
end, a GS cross-layer optimization (GSCLO) framework is further proposed, which
jointly optimizes content switching (i.e., deciding whether to upload image or
not) and power allocation (i.e., adjusting to content profiles) across
different frames by minimizing a newly derived GSMR loss function. The GSCLO
problem is addressed by an accelerated penalty optimization (APO) algorithm
that reduces computational complexity by over $10$x compared to traditional
branch-and-bound and search algorithms. Moreover, variants of GSCLO are
presented to achieve robust, low-power, and multi-robot GSMR. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the proposed GSMR paradigm and GSCLO method
achieve significant improvements over existing benchmarks on both wheeled and
legged robots in terms of diverse metrics in various scenarios. For the first
time, it is found that RoboMR can be achieved with ultra-low communication
costs, and mixture of data is useful for enhancing GS performance in dynamic
scenarios.

Abstract: Unmanned aerial-aquatic vehicles (UAAVs) can operate both in the air and

dual-function wings of puffins, we propose a UAAV with amphibious wings to
address the challenge posed by medium differences on the vehicle's propulsion
system. The amphibious wing, redesigned based on a fixed-wing structure,
features a single degree of freedom in pitch and requires no additional
components. It can generate lift in the air and function as a flapping wing for
propulsion underwater, reducing disturbance to marine life and making it
environmentally friendly. Additionally, an artificial central pattern generator
(CPG) is introduced to enhance the smoothness of the flapping motion. This
paper presents the prototype, design details, and practical implementation of
this concept.

Abstract: Recent vision-language-action (VLA) models build upon vision-language
foundations, and have achieved promising results and exhibit the possibility of
task generalization in robot manipulation. However, due to the heterogeneity of
tactile sensors and the difficulty of acquiring tactile data, current VLA
models significantly overlook the importance of tactile perception and fail in
contact-rich tasks. To address this issue, this paper proposes OmniVTLA, a
novel architecture involving tactile sensing. Specifically, our contributions
are threefold. First, our OmniVTLA features a dual-path tactile encoder
framework. This framework enhances tactile perception across diverse
vision-based and force-based tactile sensors by using a pretrained vision
transformer (ViT) and a semantically-aligned tactile ViT (SA-ViT). Second, we
introduce ObjTac, a comprehensive force-based tactile dataset capturing
textual, visual, and tactile information for 56 objects across 10 categories.
With 135K tri-modal samples, ObjTac supplements existing visuo-tactile
datasets. Third, leveraging this dataset, we train a semantically-aligned
tactile encoder to learn a unified tactile representation, serving as a better
initialization for OmniVTLA. Real-world experiments demonstrate substantial
improvements over state-of-the-art VLA baselines, achieving 96.9% success rates
with grippers, (21.9% higher over baseline) and 100% success rates with
dexterous hands (6.2% higher over baseline) in pick-and-place tasks. Besides,
OmniVTLA significantly reduces task completion time and generates smoother
trajectories through tactile sensing compared to existing VLA.

Result: 实验表明PF2MP在仿真和真实场景中均提升安全性，碰撞率显著降低。

Conclusion: PF2MP为复杂障碍环境中的安全运动生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: Deep generative models, particularly diffusion and flow matching models, have
recently shown remarkable potential in learning complex policies through
imitation learning. However, the safety of generated motions remains
overlooked, particularly in complex environments with inherent obstacles. In
this work, we address this critical gap by proposing Potential Field-Guided
Flow Matching Policy (PF2MP), a novel approach that simultaneously learns task
policies and extracts obstacle-related information, represented as a potential
field, from the same set of successful demonstrations. During inference, PF2MP
modulates the flow matching vector field via the learned potential field,
enabling safe motion generation. By leveraging these complementary fields, our
approach achieves improved safety without compromising task success across
diverse environments, such as navigation tasks and robotic manipulation
scenarios. We evaluate PF2MP in both simulation and real-world settings,
demonstrating its effectiveness in task space and joint space control.
Experimental results demonstrate that PF2MP enhances safety, achieving a
significant reduction of collisions compared to baseline policies. This work
paves the way for safer motion generation in unstructured and obstaclerich
environments.

Motivation: 传统LfD依赖大量标记数据，限制了训练规模。直接从无标记视频学习的方法往往无法有效编码与真实动作相关的潜在动作。

Result: 理论分析验证了方法的有效性，实验表明其在仿真和真实机器人平台上显著提升互信息和策略性能。

Conclusion: 新框架解决了无标记视频学习中的动作编码问题，为LfD提供了更高效的数据利用方式。

Abstract: Learning from demonstrations (LfD) typically relies on large amounts of
action-labeled expert trajectories, which fundamentally constrains the scale of
available training data. A promising alternative is to learn directly from
unlabeled video demonstrations. However, we find that existing methods tend to
encode latent actions that share little mutual information with the true robot
actions, leading to suboptimal control performance. To address this limitation,
we introduce a novel framework that explicitly maximizes the mutual information
between latent actions and true actions, even in the absence of action labels.
Our method leverage the variational information-bottleneck to extract
action-relevant representations while discarding task-irrelevant information.
We provide a theoretical analysis showing that our objective indeed maximizes
the mutual information between latent and true actions. Finally, we validate
our approach through extensive experiments: first in simulated robotic
environments and then on real-world robotic platforms, the experimental results
demonstrate that our method significantly enhances mutual information and
consistently improves policy performance.

Abstract: Robotic pick-and-place tasks in convenience stores pose challenges due to
dense object arrangements, occlusions, and variations in object properties such

planning and grasping. This paper introduces a perception-action pipeline
leveraging annotation-guided visual prompting, where bounding box annotations
identify both pickable objects and placement locations, providing structured
spatial guidance. Instead of traditional step-by-step planning, we employ
Action Chunking with Transformers (ACT) as an imitation learning algorithm,
enabling the robotic arm to predict chunked action sequences from human
demonstrations. This facilitates smooth, adaptive, and data-driven
pick-and-place operations. We evaluate our system based on success rate and
visual analysis of grasping behavior, demonstrating improved grasp accuracy and
adaptability in retail environments.

Conclusion: 机器人可通过控制反馈行为抑制上级主导，平衡讨论参与度。

Abstract: This study investigated whether robotic agents that deal with social
hierarchical relationships can reduce the dominance of superiors and equalize
participation among participants in discussions with hierarchical structures.
Thirty doctors and students having hierarchical relationship were gathered as
participants, and an intervention experiment was conducted using a robot that
can encourage participants to speak depending on social hierarchy. These were
compared with strategies that intervened equally for all participants without
considering hierarchy and with a no-action. The robots performed follow
actions, showing backchanneling to speech, and encourage actions, prompting
speech from members with less speaking time, on the basis of the hierarchical
relationships among group members to equalize participation. The experimental
results revealed that the robot's actions could potentially influence the
speaking time among members, but it could not be conclusively stated that there
were significant differences between the robot's action conditions. However,
the results suggested that it might be possible to influence speaking time
without decreasing the satisfaction of superiors. This indicates that in
discussion scenarios where experienced superiors are likely to dominate,
controlling the robot's backchanneling behavior could potentially suppress
dominance and equalize participation among group members.

TL;DR: AffordDex是一个两阶段训练框架，通过学习通用抓取策略，结合运动先验和物体功能感知，实现通用灵巧抓取。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法过于关注低层次抓取稳定性，忽视了功能感知定位和类人姿态对后续操作的重要性。

Method: 两阶段训练：第一阶段通过人类手部运动数据预训练轨迹模仿器；第二阶段通过残差模块和NAA模块优化抓取策略。

Result: AffordDex在已知物体、未知实例和全新类别上均显著优于现有方法，且姿态更类人、接触位置更合理。

Conclusion: AffordDex通过结合运动先验和功能感知，实现了通用且类人的灵巧抓取。

Abstract: A dexterous hand capable of generalizable grasping objects is fundamental for
the development of general-purpose embodied AI. However, previous methods focus
narrowly on low-level grasp stability metrics, neglecting affordance-aware
positioning and human-like poses which are crucial for downstream manipulation.
To address these limitations, we propose AffordDex, a novel framework with
two-stage training that learns a universal grasping policy with an inherent
understanding of both motion priors and object affordances. In the first stage,
a trajectory imitator is pre-trained on a large corpus of human hand motions to
instill a strong prior for natural movement. In the second stage, a residual
module is trained to adapt these general human-like motions to specific object
instances. This refinement is critically guided by two components: our Negative
Affordance-aware Segmentation (NAA) module, which identifies functionally
inappropriate contact regions, and a privileged teacher-student distillation
process that ensures the final vision-based policy is highly successful.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that AffordDex not only achieves universal
dexterous grasping but also remains remarkably human-like in posture and
functionally appropriate in contact location. As a result, AffordDex
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across seen objects,
unseen instances, and even entirely novel categories.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SDAX的学习框架，通过无监督技能发现减少人工工程需求，使四足机器人学习敏捷行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索对于四足机器人学习克服障碍的敏捷行为至关重要，但传统方法依赖人工设计，限制了泛化能力。

Method: SDAX利用无监督技能发现和双层优化过程动态调节探索程度。

Result: SDAX使机器人学会了爬行、攀爬、跳跃等复杂行为，并在真实硬件上成功部署。

Conclusion: SDAX显著减少了人工干预，实现了高效的技能学习和真实世界迁移。

Abstract: Exploration is crucial for enabling legged robots to learn agile locomotion
behaviors that can overcome diverse obstacles. However, such exploration is
inherently challenging, and we often rely on extensive reward engineering,
expert demonstrations, or curriculum learning - all of which limit
generalizability. In this work, we propose Skill Discovery as Exploration
(SDAX), a novel learning framework that significantly reduces human engineering
effort. SDAX leverages unsupervised skill discovery to autonomously acquire a
diverse repertoire of skills for overcoming obstacles. To dynamically regulate
the level of exploration during training, SDAX employs a bi-level optimization
process that autonomously adjusts the degree of exploration. We demonstrate
that SDAX enables quadrupedal robots to acquire highly agile behaviors
including crawling, climbing, leaping, and executing complex maneuvers such as
jumping off vertical walls. Finally, we deploy the learned policy on real
hardware, validating its successful transfer to the real world.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出Rational Inverse Reasoning (RIR)框架，通过分层生成模型推断潜在程序，实现机器人从少量演示中泛化到新场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类能从单次不完美演示中泛化到不同问题，而机器人需大量数据且泛化能力有限，原因是无法恢复智能行为的潜在解释。

Method: RIR通过分层生成模型推断潜在程序，结合视觉语言模型和规划器评分，生成可执行程序。

Result: RIR在连续操作任务中，仅需一次演示即可推断任务结构并泛化到新场景，优于现有视觉语言模型。

Conclusion: RIR展示了从少量演示中推断潜在程序并实现泛化的潜力，为机器人学习提供新思路。

Abstract: Humans can observe a single, imperfect demonstration and immediately
generalize to very different problem settings. Robots, in contrast, often
require hundreds of examples and still struggle to generalize beyond the
training conditions. We argue that this limitation arises from the inability to
recover the latent explanations that underpin intelligent behavior, and that
these explanations can take the form of structured programs consisting of
high-level goals, sub-task decomposition, and execution constraints. In this
work, we introduce Rational Inverse Reasoning (RIR), a framework for inferring
these latent programs through a hierarchical generative model of behavior. RIR
frames few-shot imitation as Bayesian program induction: a vision-language
model iteratively proposes structured symbolic task hypotheses, while a
planner-in-the-loop inference scheme scores each by the likelihood of the
observed demonstration under that hypothesis. This loop yields a posterior over
concise, executable programs. We evaluate RIR on a suite of continuous
manipulation tasks designed to test one-shot and few-shot generalization across
variations in object pose, count, geometry, and layout. With as little as one
demonstration, RIR infers the intended task structure and generalizes to novel
settings, outperforming state-of-the-art vision-language model baselines.

Result: 初步测试验证了生成自主表达的有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架为机器人情感表达提供了一种新方法。

Abstract: Expressive behaviors in robots are critical for effectively conveying their
emotional states during interactions with humans. In this work, we present a
framework that autonomously generates realistic and diverse robotic emotional
expressions based on expert human demonstrations captured in Mixed Reality
(MR). Our system enables experts to teleoperate a virtual robot from a
first-person perspective, capturing their facial expressions, head movements,
and upper-body gestures, and mapping these behaviors onto corresponding robotic
components including eyes, ears, neck, and arms. Leveraging a
flow-matching-based generative process, our model learns to produce coherent
and varied behaviors in real-time in response to moving objects, conditioned
explicitly on given emotional states. A preliminary test validated the
effectiveness of our approach for generating autonomous expressions.

Motivation: 物料搬运是许多行业中的核心操作，但传统方法依赖人工操作，效率低且存在安全隐患。

Method: 结合环境感知、抓取点选择、路径规划和运动控制模块，采用强化学习优化抓取点和轨迹控制。

Result: 在40吨物料搬运设备上验证了框架的有效性，展示了高精度、重复性和安全性。

Conclusion: 首次实现了全规模物料搬运任务的自动化，为行业提供了高效、安全的解决方案。

Abstract: Bulk material handling involves the efficient and precise moving of large
quantities of materials, a core operation in many industries, including cargo
ship unloading, waste sorting, construction, and demolition. These repetitive,
labor-intensive, and safety-critical operations are typically performed using
large hydraulic material handlers equipped with underactuated grippers. In this
work, we present a comprehensive framework for the autonomous execution of
large-scale material handling tasks. The system integrates specialized modules
for environment perception, pile attack point selection, path planning, and
motion control. The main contributions of this work are two reinforcement
learning-based modules: an attack point planner that selects optimal grasping
locations on the material pile to maximize removal efficiency and minimize the
number of scoops, and a robust trajectory following controller that addresses
the precision and safety challenges associated with underactuated grippers in
movement, while utilizing their free-swinging nature to release material
through dynamic throwing. We validate our framework through real-world
experiments on a 40 t material handler in a representative worksite, focusing
on two key tasks: high-throughput bulk pile management and high-precision truck
loading. Comparative evaluations against human operators demonstrate the
system's effectiveness in terms of precision, repeatability, and operational
safety. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first complete automation of
material handling tasks on a full scale.

TL;DR: GeoVLA是一个新的VLA框架，通过整合3D几何信息提升机器人操作能力，在仿真和真实环境中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前VLA模型主要依赖2D视觉输入，忽略了3D几何信息，限制了空间感知和适应性。

Result: 在LIBERO和ManiSkill2仿真基准中达到最佳性能，并在真实任务中表现出高度适应性。

Conclusion: GeoVLA通过整合3D信息显著提升了机器人操作的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a promising approach for
enabling robots to follow language instructions and predict corresponding
actions.However, current VLA models mainly rely on 2D visual inputs, neglecting
the rich geometric information in the 3D physical world, which limits their
spatial awareness and adaptability. In this paper, we present GeoVLA, a novel
VLA framework that effectively integrates 3D information to advance robotic
manipulation. It uses a vision-language model (VLM) to process images and
language instructions,extracting fused vision-language embeddings. In parallel,
it converts depth maps into point clouds and employs a customized point
encoder, called Point Embedding Network, to generate 3D geometric embeddings
independently. These produced embeddings are then concatenated and processed by
our proposed spatial-aware action expert, called 3D-enhanced Action Expert,
which combines information from different sensor modalities to produce precise
action sequences. Through extensive experiments in both simulation and
real-world environments, GeoVLA demonstrates superior performance and
robustness. It achieves state-of-the-art results in the LIBERO and ManiSkill2
simulation benchmarks and shows remarkable robustness in real-world tasks
requiring height adaptability, scale awareness and viewpoint invariance.

Abstract: Addressing irregular cutting and packing (C&P) optimization problems poses
two distinct challenges: the geometric challenge of determining whether or not
an item can be placed feasibly at a certain position, and the optimization
challenge of finding a good solution according to some objective function.
Until now, those tackling such problems have had to address both challenges
simultaneously, requiring two distinct sets of expertise and a lot of research
& development effort. One way to lower this barrier is to decouple the two
challenges. In this paper we introduce a powerful collision detection engine
(CDE) for 2D irregular C&P problems which assumes full responsibility for the
geometric challenge. The CDE (i) allows users to focus with full confidence on
their optimization challenge by abstracting geometry away and (ii) enables
independent advances to propagate to all optimization algorithms built atop it.
We present a set of core principles and design philosophies to model a general
and adaptable CDE focused on maximizing performance, accuracy and robustness.
These principles are accompanied by a concrete open-source implementation
called $\texttt{jagua-rs}$. This paper together with its implementation serves
as a catalyst for future advances in irregular C&P problems by providing a
solid foundation which can either be used as it currently exists or be further
improved upon.

Abstract: Contour trees offer an abstract representation of the level set topology in
scalar fields and are widely used in topological data analysis and
visualization. However, applying contour trees to large-scale scientific
datasets remains challenging due to scalability limitations. Recent
developments in distributed hierarchical contour trees have addressed these
challenges by enabling scalable computation across distributed systems.
Building on these structures, advanced analytical tasks -- such as volumetric
branch decomposition and contour extraction -- have been introduced to
facilitate large-scale scientific analysis. Despite these advancements, such
analytical tasks substantially increase memory usage, which hampers
scalability. In this paper, we propose a pre-simplification strategy to
significantly reduce the memory overhead associated with analytical tasks on
distributed hierarchical contour trees. We demonstrate enhanced scalability
through strong scaling experiments, constructing the largest known contour tree
-- comprising over half a trillion nodes with complex topology -- in under 15
minutes on a dataset containing 550 billion elements.
