Successfully\nperforming these maneuvers requires close consideration of the underlying\nphysics in both trajectory optimization for planning and control during\nexecution.

We remove the difficulties associated with identifying and\nretargeting the semantics of one rig framework to another by utilizing the same\nframework (3DMM, FLAME, MetaHuman, etc.) for both subjects. Although this does\nnot constrain the choice of framework when retargeting from one person to\nanother, it does force the tracker to use the game/VR character rig when\nretargeting to a game/VR character. We utilize volumetric morphing in order to\nfit facial rigs to both performers and targets; in addition, a carefully chosen\nset of Simon-Says expressions is used to calibrate each rig to the motion\nsignatures of the relevant performer or target. Although a uniform set of\nSimon-Says expressions can likely be used for all person to person retargeting,\nwe argue that person to game/VR character retargeting benefits from Simon-Says\nexpressions that capture the distinct motion signature of the game/VR character\nrig. The Simon-Says calibrated rigs tend to produce the desired expressions\nwhen exercising animation controls (as expected). Unfortunately, these\nwell-calibrated rigs still lead to undesirable controls when tracking a\nperformance (a well-behaved function can have an arbitrarily ill-conditioned\ninverse), even though they typically produce acceptable geometry\nreconstructions. Thus, we propose a fine-tuning approach that modifies the rig\nused by the tracker in order to promote the output of more semantically\nmeaningful animation controls, facilitating high efficacy retargeting.

Although existing methods have demonstrated\npromising performance, they suffer from the bottleneck of limited functional\nmotif-based representation learning, as DDIs are fundamentally caused by motif\ninteractions rather than the overall drug structures. In this paper, we propose\nan Image-enhanced molecular motif sequence representation framework for\n\\textbf{DDI} prediction, called ImageDDI, which represents a pair of drugs from\nboth global and local structures. Specifically, ImageDDI tokenizes molecules\ninto functional motifs. To effectively represent a drug pair, their motifs are\ncombined into a single sequence and embedded using a transformer-based encoder,\nstarting from the local structure representation.

Recent filtering methods often suffer\nfrom point clustering or noise retaining issues. In this paper, we propose\nHybrid Point Cloud Filtering ($\\textbf{HybridPF}$) that considers both\nshort-range and long-range filtering trajectories when removing noise. It is\nwell established that short range scores, given by $\\nabla_{x}\\log p(x_t)$, may\nprovide the necessary displacements to move noisy points to the underlying\nclean surface. By contrast, long range velocity flows approximate constant\ndisplacements directed from a high noise variant patch $x_0$ towards the\ncorresponding clean surface $x_1$. Here, noisy patches $x_t$ are viewed as\nintermediate states between the high noise variant and the clean patches. Our\nintuition is that long range information from velocity flow models can guide\nthe short range scores to align more closely with the clean points. In turn,\nscore models generally provide a quicker convergence to the clean surface.\nSpecifically, we devise two parallel modules, the ShortModule and LongModule,\neach consisting of an Encoder-Decoder pair to respectively account for\nshort-range scores and long-range flows. We find that short-range scores,\nguided by long-range features, yield filtered point clouds with good point\ndistributions and convergence near the clean surface. We design a joint loss\nfunction to simultaneously train the ShortModule and LongModule, in an\nend-to-end manner.

Our approach excels at\nhandling complex lighting such as varying-colored lighting and environment\nlighting.

Through a comprehensive investigation of manga\nnarrative understanding, we reveal that while recent large multimodal models\nexcel at individual panel interpretation, they systematically fail at temporal\ncausality and cross-panel cohesion, core requirements for coherent story\ncomprehension. We introduce a novel evaluation framework that combines\nfine-grained multimodal annotation, cross-modal embedding analysis, and\nretrieval-augmented assessment to systematically characterize these\nlimitations.\n  Our methodology includes (i) a rigorous annotation protocol linking visual\nelements to narrative structure through aligned light novel text, (ii)\ncomprehensive evaluation across multiple reasoning paradigms, including direct\ninference and retrieval-augmented generation, and (iii) cross-modal similarity\nanalysis revealing fundamental misalignments in current VLMs' joint\nrepresentations. Applying this framework to Re:Zero manga across 11 chapters\nwith 308 annotated panels, we conduct the first systematic study of long-form\nnarrative understanding in VLMs through three core evaluation axes: generative\nstorytelling, contextual dialogue grounding, and temporal reasoning. Our\nfindings demonstrate that current models lack genuine story-level intelligence,\nstruggling particularly with non-linear narratives, character consistency, and\ncausal inference across extended sequences. This work establishes both the\nfoundation and practical methodology for evaluating narrative intelligence,\nwhile providing actionable insights into the capability of deep sequential\nunderstanding of Discrete Visual Narratives beyond basic recognition in\nMultimodal Models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f53\u524d\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\u5728\u65f6\u5e8f\u89c6\u89c9\u53d9\u4e8b\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u8868\u5c42\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0e\u6df1\u5c42\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6f2b\u753b\u53d9\u4e8b\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u64c5\u957f\u5355\u5e45\u753b\u9762\u89e3\u6790\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u65f6\u5e8f\u56e0\u679c\u548c\u8de8\u753b\u9762\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6807\u6ce8\u548c\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5d4c\u5165\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63ed\u793aVLMs\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u63ed\u793a\u73b0\u6709VLMs\u5728\u957f\u65f6\u5e8f\u53d9\u4e8b\u7406\u89e3\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u65f6\u5e8f\u56e0\u679c\u548c\u8de8\u753b\u9762\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u53d9\u4e8b\u667a\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "method": "1. \u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6807\u6ce8\u534f\u8bae\uff1b2. \u591a\u63a8\u7406\u8303\u5f0f\u8bc4\u4f30\uff1b3. \u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3002\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e308\u4e2a\u6807\u6ce8\u6f2b\u753b\u753b\u9762\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u751f\u6210\u53d9\u4e8b\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5bf9\u8bdd\u548c\u65f6\u5e8f\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6545\u4e8b\u7ea7\u667a\u80fd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u53d9\u4e8b\u3001\u89d2\u8272\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u957f\u65f6\u5e8f\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u53d9\u4e8b\u667a\u80fd\u5960\u5b9a\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6df1\u5c42\u65f6\u5e8f\u7406\u89e3\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

This paper proposes Gaussian splatting (GS) RoboMR\n(GSMR), which enables the simulator to opportunistically render a\nphoto-realistic view from the robot's pose by calling ``memory'' from a GS\nmodel, thus reducing the need for excessive image uploads. However, the GS\nmodel may involve discrepancies compared to the actual environments. To this\nend, a GS cross-layer optimization (GSCLO) framework is further proposed, which\njointly optimizes content switching (i.e., deciding whether to upload image or\nnot) and power allocation (i.e., adjusting to content profiles) across\ndifferent frames by minimizing a newly derived GSMR loss function. The GSCLO\nproblem is addressed by an accelerated penalty optimization (APO) algorithm\nthat reduces computational complexity by over $10$x compared to traditional\nbranch-and-bound and search algorithms. Moreover, variants of GSCLO are\npresented to achieve robust, low-power, and multi-robot GSMR. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that the proposed GSMR paradigm and GSCLO method\nachieve significant improvements over existing benchmarks on both wheeled and\nlegged robots in terms of diverse metrics in various scenarios.

Moreover, they\nexperience catastrophic forgetting of old classes when required to continuously\nlearn object instances belonging to new categories. To resolve these\nchallenges, we develop a novel Hierarchical Visual Prompt Learning (HVPL) model\nthat overcomes catastrophic forgetting of previous categories from both\nframe-level and video-level perspectives. Specifically, to mitigate forgetting\nat the frame level, we devise a task-specific frame prompt and an orthogonal\ngradient correction (OGC) module. The OGC module helps the frame prompt encode\ntask-specific global instance information for new classes in each individual\nframe by projecting its gradients onto the orthogonal feature space of old\nclasses. Furthermore, to address forgetting at the video level, we design a\ntask-specific video prompt and a video context decoder.

However, existing methods face\nlimitations in simultaneously satisfying three essential criteria for\ngeneralizable watermarking: 1) invisibility (imperceptible hide of watermarks),\n2) robustness (reliable watermark recovery under diverse conditions), and 3)\nbroad applicability (low latency in watermarking process). To address these\nlimitations, we propose a Hierarchical Watermark Learning (HiWL), a two-stage\noptimization that enable a watermarking model to simultaneously achieve three\ncriteria. In the first stage, distribution alignment learning is designed to\nestablish a common latent space with two constraints: 1) visual consistency\nbetween watermarked and non-watermarked images, and 2) information invariance\nacross watermark latent representations. In this way, multi-modal inputs\nincluding watermark message (binary codes) and cover images (RGB pixels) can be\nwell represented, ensuring the invisibility of watermarks and robustness in\nwatermarking process thereby. The second stage employs generalized watermark\nrepresentation learning to establish a disentanglement policy for separating\nwatermarks from image content in RGB space.

Noticeable banding artifacts can severely impact the\nperceptual quality of videos viewed on a high-end HDTV or high-resolution\nscreen. Hence, there is a pressing need for a systematic investigation of the\nbanding video quality assessment problem for advanced video codecs. Given that\nthe existing publicly available datasets for studying banding artifacts are\nlimited to still picture data only, which cannot account for temporal banding\ndynamics, we have created a first-of-a-kind open video dataset, dubbed\nLIVE-YT-Banding, which consists of 160 videos generated by four different\ncompression parameters using the AV1 video codec. A total of 7,200 subjective\nopinions are collected from a cohort of 45 human subjects. To demonstrate the\nvalue of this new resources, we tested and compared a variety of models that\ndetect banding occurrences, and measure their impact on perceived quality.\nAmong these, we introduce an effective and efficient new no-reference (NR)\nvideo quality evaluator which we call CBAND. CBAND leverages the properties of\nthe learned statistics of natural images expressed in the embeddings of deep\nneural networks.

Existing deep segmentation\nnetworks typically weight all pixels equally under cross-entropy (CE) loss,\noverlooking the fact that sub-regions of lens structures are inhomogeneous\n(e.g., some regions perform better than others) and that boundary regions often\nsuffer from poor segmentation calibration at the pixel level. Clinically,\nexperts annotate different sub-regions of lens structures with varying\nconfidence levels, considering factors such as sub-region proportions,\nambiguous boundaries, and lens structure shapes. Motivated by this observation,\nwe propose an Adaptive Confidence-Wise (ACW) loss to group each lens structure\nsub-region into different confidence sub-regions via a confidence threshold\nfrom the unique region aspect, aiming to exploit the potential of expert\nannotation confidence prior. Specifically, ACW clusters each target region into\nlow-confidence and high-confidence groups and then applies a region-weighted\nloss to reweigh each confidence group. Moreover, we design an adaptive\nconfidence threshold optimization algorithm to adjust the confidence threshold\nof ACW dynamically. Additionally, to better quantify the miscalibration errors\nin boundary region segmentation, we propose a new metric, termed Boundary\nExpected Calibration Error (BECE).

However, real-world scenarios are more complex, often requiring\nthe recognition of an object in a cluttered scene based on a vague, free-form\ndescription. To this end, we present ROOMELSA, a new benchmark designed to\nevaluate a system's ability to interpret natural language. Specifically,\nROOMELSA attends to a specific region within a panoramic room image and\naccurately retrieves the corresponding 3D model from a large database. In\naddition, ROOMELSA includes over 1,600 apartment scenes, nearly 5,200 rooms,\nand more than 44,000 targeted queries. Empirically, while coarse object\nretrieval is largely solved, only one top-performing model consistently ranked\nthe correct match first across nearly all test cases.

Additionally, identity\npreservation is rarely taken into accountor evaluated on a single face\nrecognition system without any control or guarantees on whether identity would\nbe preserved in a generated aged/de-aged face. In this paper, we propose to\nsynthesize aged and de-aged faces via editing latent space of StyleGAN2 using a\nsimple support vector modeling of aging/de-aging direction and several feature\nselection approaches.

Project page:\n  https://github.com/HVision-NKU/OffSeg", "summary": "Semantic segmentation is fundamental to vision systems requiring pixel-level\nscene understanding, yet deploying it on resource-constrained devices demands\nefficient architectures. Although existing methods achieve real-time inference\nthrough lightweight designs, we reveal their inherent limitation: misalignment\nbetween class representations and image features caused by a per-pixel\nclassification paradigm. With experimental analysis, we find that this paradigm\nresults in a highly challenging assumption for efficient scenarios: Image pixel\nfeatures should not vary for the same category in different images. To address\nthis dilemma, we propose a coupled dual-branch offset learning paradigm that\nexplicitly learns feature and class offsets to dynamically refine both class\nrepresentations and spatial image features. Based on the proposed paradigm, we\nconstruct an efficient semantic segmentation network, OffSeg.

Unlike existing methods, GaussianUpdate explicitly models\ndifferent types of changes through a novel multi-stage update strategy.\nAdditionally, we introduce a visibility-aware continual learning approach with\ngenerative replay, enabling self-aware updating without the need to store\nimages. The experiments on the benchmark dataset demonstrate our method\nachieves superior and real-time rendering with the capability of visualizing\nchanges over different times", "AI": {"tldr": "GaussianUpdate\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u54083D\u9ad8\u65af\u8868\u793a\u4e0e\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u7684\u65b0\u89c6\u56fe\u5408\u6210\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5b9e\u65f6\u6e32\u67d3\u4e0e\u53d8\u5316\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9002\u5e94\u573a\u666f\u53d8\u5316\u65f6\u8981\u4e48\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u7ec6\u8282\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u80fd\u4fdd\u7559\u5386\u53f2\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u75283D\u9ad8\u65af\u8868\u793a\u4e0e\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u66f4\u65b0\u7b56\u7565\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u56de\u653e\u7684\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u6e32\u67d3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u95f4\u70b9\u7684\u573a\u666f\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "GaussianUpdate\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u7684\u65b0\u89c6\u56fe\u5408\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This study introduces a comprehensive pipeline for standardized\npostsurtical reporting in CNS tumors. Using the Attention U-Net architecture,\nsegmentation models were trained for the preoperative (non-enhancing) tumor\ncore, postoperative contrast-enhancing residual tumor, and resection cavity.\nAdditionally, MR sequence classification and tumor type identification for\ncontrast-enhancing lesions were explored using the DenseNet architecture. The\nmodels were integrated into a reporting pipeline, following the RANO 2.0\nguidelines. Training was conducted on multicentric datasets comprising 2000 to\n7000 patients, using a 5-fold cross-validation. Evaluation included patient-,\nvoxel-, and object-wise metrics, with benchmarking against the latest BraTS\nchallenge results.

We substitute uniform sampling with a refined approach inspired\nby classic video compression principles to identify and capture keyframes based\non their temporal redundancy. By assigning varying condensation ratios to\nframes based on their contextual relevance, KFFocus efficiently reduces token\nredundancy while preserving informative content details. Additionally, we\nintroduce a spatiotemporal modeling module that encodes both the temporal\nrelationships between video frames and the spatial structure within each frame,\nthus providing Vid-LLMs with a nuanced understanding of spatial-temporal\ndynamics.

For recent popular video generative models, however, the Variational\nAutoEncoder (VAE) represents one of the major computational bottlenecks. Both\nlarge parameter sizes and mismatched kernels cause out-of-memory errors or\nextremely slow inference on mobile devices. To address this, we propose a\nlow-cost solution that efficiently transfers widely used video VAEs to mobile\ndevices. (1) We analyze redundancy in existing VAE architectures and get\nempirical design insights. By integrating 3D depthwise separable convolutions\ninto our model, we significantly reduce the number of parameters. (2) We\nobserve that the upsampling techniques in mainstream video VAEs are poorly\nsuited to mobile hardware and form the main bottleneck. In response, we propose\na decoupled 3D pixel shuffle scheme that slashes end-to-end delay. Building\nupon these, we develop a universal mobile-oriented VAE decoder, Turbo-VAED. (3)\nWe propose an efficient VAE decoder training method. Since only the decoder is\nused during deployment, we distill it to Turbo-VAED instead of retraining the\nfull VAE, enabling fast mobile adaptation with minimal performance loss. To our\nknowledge, our method enables real-time 720p video VAE decoding on mobile\ndevices for the first time. This approach is widely applicable to most video\nVAEs. When integrated into four representative models, with training cost as\nlow as $95, it accelerates original VAEs by up to 84.5x at 720p resolution on\nGPUs, uses as low as 17.5% of original parameter count, and retains 96.9% of\nthe original reconstruction quality. Compared to mobile-optimized VAEs,\nTurbo-VAED achieves a 2.9x speedup in FPS and better reconstruction quality on\nthe iPhone 16 Pro.
