### [1] [RayletDF: Raylet Distance Fields for Generalizable 3D Surface Reconstruction from Point Clouds or Gaussians](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09830)
*Shenxing Wei,Jinxi Li,Yafei Yang,Siyuan Zhou,Bo Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为RayletDF的通用方法，用于从点云或3DGS预估计的3D高斯分布中重建3D表面，通过射线距离场直接预测表面点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于坐标的方法在渲染显式表面时计算量大，需要更高效的方法。

Method: 采用射线特征提取器、射线距离场预测器和多射线混合器三个模块，提取局部几何特征、预测距离并聚合结果。

Result: 在多个公开数据集上表现优异，具有出色的泛化能力，能在未见数据集上单次前向传播重建3D表面。

Conclusion: RayletDF在3D表面重建中表现出高效性和泛化能力。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a generalizable method for 3D surface
reconstruction from raw point clouds or pre-estimated 3D Gaussians by 3DGS from
RGB images. Unlike existing coordinate-based methods which are often
computationally intensive when rendering explicit surfaces, our proposed
method, named RayletDF, introduces a new technique called raylet distance
field, which aims to directly predict surface points from query rays. Our
pipeline consists of three key modules: a raylet feature extractor, a raylet
distance field predictor, and a multi-raylet blender. These components work
together to extract fine-grained local geometric features, predict raylet
distances, and aggregate multiple predictions to reconstruct precise surface
points. We extensively evaluate our method on multiple public real-world
datasets, demonstrating superior performance in surface reconstruction from
point clouds or 3D Gaussians. Most notably, our method achieves exceptional
generalization ability, successfully recovering 3D surfaces in a single-forward
pass across unseen datasets in testing.

*David Dinkevich,Matan Levy,Omri Avrahami,Dvir Samuel,Dani Lischinski*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Story2Board是一个无需训练的框架，用于从自然语言生成富有表现力的故事板，通过一致性机制提升连贯性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法过于关注主题身份，忽略了视觉叙事的关键方面（如空间构图、背景演变和叙事节奏）。

Method: 引入轻量级一致性框架，包括潜在面板锚定和互注意力值混合，无需架构更改或微调。

Result: 在多样性和一致性上优于现有基线，生成更具动态性和叙事吸引力的故事板。

Conclusion: Story2Board在视觉叙事中表现出色，为故事板生成提供了新方法。

Abstract: We present Story2Board, a training-free framework for expressive storyboard
generation from natural language. Existing methods narrowly focus on subject
identity, overlooking key aspects of visual storytelling such as spatial
composition, background evolution, and narrative pacing. To address this, we
introduce a lightweight consistency framework composed of two components:
Latent Panel Anchoring, which preserves a shared character reference across
panels, and Reciprocal Attention Value Mixing, which softly blends visual
features between token pairs with strong reciprocal attention. Together, these
mechanisms enhance coherence without architectural changes or fine-tuning,
enabling state-of-the-art diffusion models to generate visually diverse yet
consistent storyboards. To structure generation, we use an off-the-shelf
language model to convert free-form stories into grounded panel-level prompts.
To evaluate, we propose the Rich Storyboard Benchmark, a suite of open-domain
narratives designed to assess layout diversity and background-grounded
storytelling, in addition to consistency. We also introduce a new Scene
Diversity metric that quantifies spatial and pose variation across storyboards.
Our qualitative and quantitative results, as well as a user study, show that
Story2Board produces more dynamic, coherent, and narratively engaging
storyboards than existing baselines.

### [3] [A Context-aware Attention and Graph Neural Network-based Multimodal Framework for Misogyny Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09175)
*Mohammad Zia Ur Rehman,Sufyaan Zahoor,Areeb Manzoor,Musharaf Maqbool,Nagendra Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种多模态框架，用于检测社交媒体上针对女性的厌女和性别歧视内容，通过三个模块（MANM、GFRM、CFLM）提升检测性能，并在两个数据集上表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体上针对女性的攻击性内容较多，现有方法难以有效检测厌女内容，因此需要专门解决方案。

Method: 提出多模态框架，包含MANM（多模态注意力）、GFRM（基于图的特征重构）和CFLM（内容特定特征学习），并结合厌女词典和测试时增强技术。

Result: 在MAMI和MMHS150K数据集上，宏F1分别平均提升10.17%和8.88%。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了厌女和性别歧视内容的检测性能，为社交媒体内容审核提供了有效工具。

Abstract: A substantial portion of offensive content on social media is directed
towards women. Since the approaches for general offensive content detection
face a challenge in detecting misogynistic content, it requires solutions
tailored to address offensive content against women. To this end, we propose a
novel multimodal framework for the detection of misogynistic and sexist
content. The framework comprises three modules: the Multimodal Attention module
(MANM), the Graph-based Feature Reconstruction Module (GFRM), and the
Content-specific Features Learning Module (CFLM). The MANM employs adaptive
gating-based multimodal context-aware attention, enabling the model to focus on
relevant visual and textual information and generating contextually relevant
features. The GFRM module utilizes graphs to refine features within individual
modalities, while the CFLM focuses on learning text and image-specific features
such as toxicity features and caption features. Additionally, we curate a set
of misogynous lexicons to compute the misogyny-specific lexicon score from the
text. We apply test-time augmentation in feature space to better generalize the
predictions on diverse inputs. The performance of the proposed approach has
been evaluated on two multimodal datasets, MAMI and MMHS150K, with 11,000 and
13,494 samples, respectively. The proposed method demonstrates an average
improvement of 10.17% and 8.88% in macro-F1 over existing methods on the MAMI
and MMHS150K datasets, respectively.

### [4] [IAD-R1: Reinforcing Consistent Reasoning in Industrial Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09178)
*Yanhui Li,Yunkang Cao,Chengliang Liu,Yuan Xiong,Xinghui Dong,Chao Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IAD-R1是一个通用的后训练框架，显著提升不同架构和参数规模的视觉语言模型在工业异常检测中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业异常检测中缺陷样本稀缺，传统方法受限，视觉语言模型虽有优势但表现不足。

Method: 采用两阶段训练策略：PA-SFT阶段利用高质量数据集增强异常感知能力；SC-GRPO阶段通过奖励函数实现从感知到解释的飞跃。

Result: 在7个视觉语言模型上显著提升性能，平均准确率最高提升43.3%，小模型表现超越商业大模型。

Conclusion: IAD-R1框架有效且优越，相关资源将公开。

Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection is a critical component of modern manufacturing,
yet the scarcity of defective samples restricts traditional detection methods
to scenario-specific applications. Although Vision-Language Models (VLMs)
demonstrate significant advantages in generalization capabilities, their
performance in industrial anomaly detection remains limited. To address this
challenge, we propose IAD-R1, a universal post-training framework applicable to
VLMs of different architectures and parameter scales, which substantially
enhances their anomaly detection capabilities. IAD-R1 employs a two-stage
training strategy: the Perception Activation Supervised Fine-Tuning (PA-SFT)
stage utilizes a meticulously constructed high-quality Chain-of-Thought dataset
(Expert-AD) for training, enhancing anomaly perception capabilities and
establishing reasoning-to-answer correlations; the Structured Control Group
Relative Policy Optimization (SC-GRPO) stage employs carefully designed reward
functions to achieve a capability leap from "Anomaly Perception" to "Anomaly
Interpretation". Experimental results demonstrate that IAD-R1 achieves
significant improvements across 7 VLMs, attaining up to 43.3% enhancement in
average accuracy on 6 industrial anomaly detection benchmark datasets. Notably,
the 0.5B parameter model trained with IAD-R1 surpasses commercial models
including GPT-4.1 and Claude-Sonnet-4 in zero-shot settings, demonstrating the
effectiveness and superiority of IAD-R1. The dataset, code, and all model
weights will be publicly available at https://github.com/Yanhui-Lee/IAD-R1.

### [5] [A Neurosymbolic Framework for Interpretable Cognitive Attack Detection in Augmented Reality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09185)
*Rongqian Chen,Allison Andreyev,Yanming Xiu,Mahdi Imani,Bin Li,Maria Gorlatova,Gang Tan,Tian Lan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CADAR是一种新型神经符号方法，用于检测AR中的认知攻击，结合了视觉语言模型和粒子滤波推理，提高了检测准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检测方法局限于像素级处理或依赖黑盒视觉语言模型，缺乏语义推理能力和可解释性。

Method: CADAR融合多模态视觉语言输入，生成符号感知图，利用粒子滤波进行统计推理。

Result: 在扩展的AR认知攻击数据集上，CADAR比基线方法准确率提升高达10.7%。

Conclusion: 神经符号方法在AR认知攻击检测中具有高效性和可解释性的潜力。

Abstract: Augmented Reality (AR) enriches perception by overlaying virtual elements on
the physical world. Due to its growing popularity, cognitive attacks that alter
AR content to manipulate users' semantic perception have received increasing
attention. Existing detection methods often focus on visual changes, which are
restricted to pixel- or image-level processing and lack semantic reasoning
capabilities, or they rely on pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), which
function as black-box approaches with limited interpretability. In this paper,
we present CADAR, a novel neurosymbolic approach for cognitive attack detection
in AR. It fuses multimodal vision-language inputs using neural VLMs to obtain a
symbolic perception-graph representation, incorporating prior knowledge,
salience weighting, and temporal correlations. The model then enables
particle-filter based statistical reasoning -- a sequential Monte Carlo method
-- to detect cognitive attacks. Thus, CADAR inherits the adaptability of
pre-trained VLM and the interpretability and reasoning rigor of particle
filtering. Experiments on an extended AR cognitive attack dataset show accuracy
improvements of up to 10.7% over strong baselines on challenging AR attack
scenarios, underscoring the promise of neurosymbolic methods for effective and
interpretable cognitive attack detection.

### [6] [CWFBind: Geometry-Awareness for Fast and Accurate Protein-Ligand Docking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09499)
*Liyan Jia,Chuan-Xian Ren,Hong Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CWFBind是一种基于局部曲率特征的快速、准确的分子对接方法，通过整合几何信息提升预测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习方法在分子对接中忽略了关键的几何信息，导致口袋定位和结合构象不准确。

Method: CWFBind结合局部曲率描述符和度感知加权机制，增强几何表示和空间结构捕捉能力，并采用动态半径策略解决类别不平衡问题。

Result: 在多个对接基准测试中，CWFBind表现出竞争性性能，平衡了准确性和效率。

Conclusion: CWFBind通过几何信息增强和动态策略，显著提升了分子对接的精度和实用性。

Abstract: Accurately predicting the binding conformation of small-molecule ligands to
protein targets is a critical step in rational drug design. Although recent
deep learning-based docking surpasses traditional methods in speed and
accuracy, many approaches rely on graph representations and language
model-inspired encoders while neglecting critical geometric information,
resulting in inaccurate pocket localization and unrealistic binding
conformations. In this study, we introduce CWFBind, a weighted, fast, and
accurate docking method based on local curvature features. Specifically, we
integrate local curvature descriptors during the feature extraction phase to
enrich the geometric representation of both proteins and ligands, complementing
existing chemical, sequence, and structural features. Furthermore, we embed
degree-aware weighting mechanisms into the message passing process, enhancing
the model's ability to capture spatial structural distinctions and interaction
strengths. To address the class imbalance challenge in pocket prediction,
CWFBind employs a ligand-aware dynamic radius strategy alongside an enhanced
loss function, facilitating more precise identification of binding regions and
key residues. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that CWFBind
achieves competitive performance across multiple docking benchmarks, offering a
balanced trade-off between accuracy and efficiency.

### [7] [RL-MoE: An Image-Based Privacy Preserving Approach In Intelligent Transportation System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09186)
*Abdolazim Rezaei,Mehdi Sookhak,Mahboobeh Haghparast*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RL-MoE框架通过将敏感视觉数据转换为隐私保护的文本描述，解决了智能交通系统中隐私与数据效用之间的冲突。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能交通系统中AI摄像头的普及导致隐私与数据需求之间的严重冲突，现有隐私保护机制不足。

Method: 结合Mixture-of-Experts架构和强化学习代理，生成兼具语义准确性和隐私保护的文本描述。

Result: 实验表明，RL-MoE将重放攻击成功率降至9.4%，同时生成比基线方法更丰富的文本内容。

Conclusion: RL-MoE为隐私敏感领域提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案，推动了更安全的智能城市和自动驾驶网络。

Abstract: The proliferation of AI-powered cameras in Intelligent Transportation Systems
(ITS) creates a severe conflict between the need for rich visual data and the
fundamental right to privacy. Existing privacy-preserving mechanisms, such as
blurring or encryption, are often insufficient, creating an undesirable
trade-off where either privacy is compromised against advanced reconstruction
attacks or data utility is critically degraded. To resolve this impasse, we
propose RL-MoE, a novel framework that transforms sensitive visual data into
privacy-preserving textual descriptions, eliminating the need for direct image
transmission. RL-MoE uniquely combines a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture
for nuanced, multi-aspect scene decomposition with a Reinforcement Learning
(RL) agent that optimizes the generated text for a dual objective of semantic
accuracy and privacy preservation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
RL-MoE provides superior privacy protection, reducing the success rate of
replay attacks to just 9.4\% on the CFP-FP dataset, while simultaneously
generating richer textual content than baseline methods. Our work provides a
practical and scalable solution for building trustworthy AI systems in
privacy-sensitive domains, paving the way for more secure smart city and
autonomous vehicle networks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于GAN和知识蒸馏的合成深度人脸生成框架，结合遗传算法优化潜在向量，显著提升了情感识别的多样性和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决情感计算中高质量、多样化深度面部数据集的缺乏问题。

Method: 使用优化的GAN与知识蒸馏（EMA教师模型）生成合成深度人脸，结合遗传算法优化潜在向量，并提取多种特征进行分类。

Result: 在多样性和质量上优于GAN、VAE、GMM和KDE，分类准确率达94%和96%。

Conclusion: 该方法在情感识别中表现出色，优于现有技术。

Abstract: Affective computing faces a major challenge: the lack of high-quality,
diverse depth facial datasets for recognizing subtle emotional expressions. We
propose a framework for synthetic depth face generation using an optimized GAN
with Knowledge Distillation (EMA teacher models) to stabilize training, improve
quality, and prevent mode collapse. We also apply Genetic Algorithms to evolve
GAN latent vectors based on image statistics, boosting diversity and visual
quality for target emotions. The approach outperforms GAN, VAE, GMM, and KDE in
both diversity and quality. For classification, we extract and concatenate LBP,
HOG, Sobel edge, and intensity histogram features, achieving 94% and 96%
accuracy with XGBoost. Evaluation using FID, IS, SSIM, and PSNR shows
consistent improvement over state-of-the-art methods.

### [9] [$Δ$-AttnMask: Attention-Guided Masked Hidden States for Efficient Data Selection and Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09199)
*Jucheng Hu,Suorong Yang,Dongzhan Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Δ-AttnMask的数据高效框架，通过注意力引导的隐藏状态掩码量化样本质量，显著减少数据需求并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉指令微调（VIF）需要多模态数据以支持视觉和文本联合理解，但数据选择问题尚未充分研究。

Method: Δ-AttnMask通过计算原始状态与高注意力区域掩码状态的损失差异（Δ），无需额外标签或训练即可评估样本质量。

Result: 实验表明，Δ-AttnMask仅需20%数据即可实现最优性能，训练速度提升5倍，整体准确率超过全数据集基线10.1%。

Conclusion: Δ-AttnMask的模型无关和数据无关设计使其在多模态和架构中具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Visual Instruction Finetuning (VIF) is pivotal for post-training
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Unlike unimodal instruction finetuning in
plain-text large language models, which mainly requires instruction datasets to
enable model instruction-following ability, VIF also requires multimodal data
to enable joint visual and textual understanding; therefore, it typically
requires more data. Consequently, VIF imposes stricter data selection
challenges: the method must scale efficiently to handle larger data demands
while ensuring the quality of both visual and textual content, as well as their
alignment. Despite its critical impact on performance, data selection for VIF
remains an understudied area. In this paper, we propose $\Delta$-AttnMask. This
data-efficient framework quantifies sample quality through attention-guided
masking of the model's hidden states, jointly evaluating image-text pairs
without requiring domain labels, auxiliary models, or extra training. By
computing loss differences ($\Delta$) between the original states and states
masked using high-attention regions, $\Delta$-AttnMask intrinsically assesses
sample quality. Experiments across multiple VLMs and datasets show that
$\Delta$-AttnMask achieves state-of-the-art performance with just 20% of data,
accelerating training by 5x while surpassing full-dataset baselines by +10.1%
in overall accuracy. Its model-agnostic and data-agnostic design ensures broad
applicability across modalities and architectures.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种轻量级的个性化特征翻译（PFT）方法，用于源自由域适应（SFDA），以解决仅含中性表情的无标签目标数据的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SFDA方法通常无法适应仅含单一类别的目标数据，且生成非中性表情图像不稳定且计算量大。

Method: PFT在潜在空间中进行特征翻译，通过预训练翻译器保留表情信息，并在目标数据上适应，无需源数据或图像合成。

Result: PFT避免了表情生成的复杂性，生成优化的分类嵌入，减少了计算开销。

Conclusion: PFT是一种高效的方法，优于基于图像的翻译方法。

Abstract: Facial expression recognition (FER) models are employed in many video-based
affective computing applications, such as human-computer interaction and
healthcare monitoring. However, deep FER models often struggle with subtle
expressions and high inter-subject variability, limiting their performance in
real-world applications. To improve their performance, source-free domain
adaptation (SFDA) methods have been proposed to personalize a pretrained source
model using only unlabeled target domain data, thereby avoiding data privacy,
storage, and transmission constraints. This paper addresses a challenging
scenario where source data is unavailable for adaptation, and only unlabeled
target data consisting solely of neutral expressions is available. SFDA methods
are not typically designed to adapt using target data from only a single class.
Further, using models to generate facial images with non-neutral expressions
can be unstable and computationally intensive. In this paper, personalized
feature translation (PFT) is proposed for SFDA. Unlike current image
translation methods for SFDA, our lightweight method operates in the latent
space. We first pre-train the translator on the source domain data to transform
the subject-specific style features from one source subject into another.
Expression information is preserved by optimizing a combination of expression
consistency and style-aware objectives. Then, the translator is adapted on
neutral target data, without using source data or image synthesis. By
translating in the latent space, PFT avoids the complexity and noise of face
expression generation, producing discriminative embeddings optimized for
classification. Using PFT eliminates the need for image synthesis, reduces
computational overhead (using a lightweight translator), and only adapts part
of the model, making the method efficient compared to image-based translation.

TL;DR: 论文提出了MME-Emotion基准，用于评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的情感情感和推理能力，发现当前模型的性能仍有不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前情感计算领域缺乏全面的基准测试，无法评估MLLMs在多样场景下的泛化能力和情感触发因素推理能力。

Method: 提出MME-Emotion基准，包含6,000多个视频片段和问答对，涵盖八种情感任务，并通过混合指标和多代理系统框架进行评估。

Result: 评估20个先进MLLMs，发现其情感情感表现不佳（最高识别得分39.3%，推理得分56.0%），通用模型和专用模型各有优势。

Conclusion: MME-Emotion为未来提升MLLMs的情感情感能力提供了基础。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have catalyzed
transformative progress in affective computing, enabling models to exhibit
emergent emotional intelligence. Despite substantial methodological progress,
current emotional benchmarks remain limited, as it is still unknown: (a) the
generalization abilities of MLLMs across distinct scenarios, and (b) their
reasoning capabilities to identify the triggering factors behind emotional
states. To bridge these gaps, we present \textbf{MME-Emotion}, a systematic
benchmark that assesses both emotional understanding and reasoning capabilities
of MLLMs, enjoying \textit{scalable capacity}, \textit{diverse settings}, and
\textit{unified protocols}. As the largest emotional intelligence benchmark for
MLLMs, MME-Emotion contains over 6,000 curated video clips with task-specific
questioning-answering (QA) pairs, spanning broad scenarios to formulate eight
emotional tasks. It further incorporates a holistic evaluation suite with
hybrid metrics for emotion recognition and reasoning, analyzed through a
multi-agent system framework. Through a rigorous evaluation of 20 advanced
MLLMs, we uncover both their strengths and limitations, yielding several key
insights: \ding{182} Current MLLMs exhibit unsatisfactory emotional
intelligence, with the best-performing model achieving only $39.3\%$
recognition score and $56.0\%$ Chain-of-Thought (CoT) score on our benchmark.
\ding{183} Generalist models (\emph{e.g.}, Gemini-2.5-Pro) derive emotional
intelligence from generalized multimodal understanding capabilities, while
specialist models (\emph{e.g.}, R1-Omni) can achieve comparable performance
through domain-specific post-training adaptation. By introducing MME-Emotion,
we hope that it can serve as a foundation for advancing MLLMs' emotional
intelligence in the future.

*Zuoou Li,Weitong Zhang,Jingyuan Wang,Shuyuan Zhang,Wenjia Bai,Bernhard Kainz,Mengyun Qiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种四轴评估框架（Balanced Structural Decomposition, BSD）来更准确地评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的对抗性提示攻击效果，并揭示了现有安全系统的弱点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估标准可能高估了对抗性提示攻击的成功率，许多被标记为“成功”的响应实际上是良性的、模糊的或与恶意目标无关。

Method: 引入四轴评估框架（输入相关性、输入分布外强度、输出危害性、输出拒绝率），并提出递归重写策略BSD，通过平衡相关性和新颖性来优化攻击效果。

Result: BSD在13个商业和开源MLLMs上测试，攻击成功率提高67%，危害性提高21%，同时减少了拒绝率。

Conclusion: BSD揭示了当前多模态安全系统中未被充分认识的弱点，为改进安全机制提供了新方向。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are widely used in vision-language
reasoning tasks. However, their vulnerability to adversarial prompts remains a
serious concern, as safety mechanisms often fail to prevent the generation of
harmful outputs. Although recent jailbreak strategies report high success
rates, many responses classified as "successful" are actually benign, vague, or
unrelated to the intended malicious goal. This mismatch suggests that current
evaluation standards may overestimate the effectiveness of such attacks. To
address this issue, we introduce a four-axis evaluation framework that
considers input on-topicness, input out-of-distribution (OOD) intensity, output
harmfulness, and output refusal rate. This framework identifies truly effective
jailbreaks. In a substantial empirical study, we reveal a structural trade-off:
highly on-topic prompts are frequently blocked by safety filters, whereas those
that are too OOD often evade detection but fail to produce harmful content.
However, prompts that balance relevance and novelty are more likely to evade
filters and trigger dangerous output. Building on this insight, we develop a
recursive rewriting strategy called Balanced Structural Decomposition (BSD).
The approach restructures malicious prompts into semantically aligned
sub-tasks, while introducing subtle OOD signals and visual cues that make the
inputs harder to detect. BSD was tested across 13 commercial and open-source
MLLMs, where it consistently led to higher attack success rates, more harmful
outputs, and fewer refusals. Compared to previous methods, it improves success
rates by $67\%$ and harmfulness by $21\%$, revealing a previously
underappreciated weakness in current multimodal safety systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手写数学表达式识别（HMER）领域因数据稀缺而受限，主要由于人工标注成本高昂。

Method: 提出了一种数据引擎，结合有限手写公式和大规模LaTeX渲染公式，构建了Tex80M数据集，并通过混合训练开发了TexTeller模型。

Result: TexTeller在几乎所有基准测试中达到了SOTA性能。

Conclusion: 论文将公开模型、数据集和代码，以推动HMER领域的进一步发展。

Abstract: Large foundation models have achieved significant performance gains through
scalable training on massive datasets. However, the field of
\textbf{H}andwritten \textbf{M}athematical \textbf{E}xpression
\textbf{R}ecognition (HMER) has been impeded by the scarcity of data, primarily
due to the arduous and costly process of manual annotation. To bridge this gap,
we propose a novel method integrating limited handwritten formulas with
large-scale LaTeX-rendered formulas by developing a scalable data engine to
generate complex and consistent LaTeX sequences. With this engine, we built the
largest formula dataset to date, termed \texttt{Tex80M}, comprising over 80
million high-quality training instances. Then we propose \texttt{TexTeller},
the first HMER model trained at scale, by mix-training \texttt{Tex80M} with a
relatively small HME dataset. The expansive training dataset and our refined
pipeline have equipped \texttt{TexTeller} with state-of-the-art (SOTA)
performance across nearly all benchmarks. To advance the field, we will openly
release our complete model, entire dataset, and full codebase, enabling further
research building upon our contributions.

Result: GDAGS在多种真实场景基准测试中表现出色，渲染质量提升，内存消耗减少50%。

Conclusion: GDAGS通过优化高斯分布，有效解决了现有方法的局限性，为实时逼真渲染提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The emergence of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has significantly advanced
novel view synthesis through explicit scene representation, enabling real-time
photorealistic rendering. However, existing approaches manifest two critical
limitations in complex scenarios: (1) Over-reconstruction occurs when
persistent large Gaussians cannot meet adaptive splitting thresholds during
density control. This is exacerbated by conflicting gradient directions that
prevent effective splitting of these Gaussians; (2) Over-densification of
Gaussians occurs in regions with aligned gradient aggregation, leading to
redundant component proliferation. This redundancy significantly increases
memory overhead due to unnecessary data retention. We present
Gradient-Direction-Aware Gaussian Splatting (GDAGS), a gradient-direction-aware
adaptive density control framework to address these challenges. Our key
innovations: the gradient coherence ratio (GCR), computed through normalized
gradient vector norms, which explicitly discriminates Gaussians with concordant
versus conflicting gradient directions; and a nonlinear dynamic weighting
mechanism leverages the GCR to enable gradient-direction-aware density control.
Specifically, GDAGS prioritizes conflicting-gradient Gaussians during splitting
operations to enhance geometric details while suppressing redundant
concordant-direction Gaussians. Conversely, in cloning processes, GDAGS
promotes concordant-direction Gaussian densification for structural completion
while preventing conflicting-direction Gaussian overpopulation. Comprehensive
evaluations across diverse real-world benchmarks demonstrate that GDAGS
achieves superior rendering quality while effectively mitigating
over-reconstruction, suppressing over-densification, and constructing compact
scene representations with 50\% reduced memory consumption through optimized
Gaussians utilization.

TL;DR: 论文提出了FineState-Bench，首个用于评估细粒度GUI代理操作的框架，通过多平台任务基准和视觉诊断工具VDA，揭示了当前GUI代理的主要瓶颈是视觉定位能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GUI代理评估框架过于关注粗粒度任务完成，忽视了细粒度控制能力的重要性，限制了实际应用效果。

Method: 引入FineState-Bench，包含2257个多平台任务基准，采用四阶段指标评估感知到控制的全过程，并开发了VDA工具进行视觉定位能力的定量解耦分析。

Result: 实验显示最先进模型的细粒度交互准确率仅为32.8%，理想视觉定位可将Gemini-2.5-Flash的成功率提升14.9%。

Conclusion: 当前GUI代理的主要瓶颈是基础视觉定位能力，FineState-Bench为未来研究提供了开源评估标准。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence technology,
Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents have demonstrated tremendous potential
for autonomously managing daily tasks through natural language instructions.
However, current evaluation frameworks for GUI agents suffer from fundamental
flaws: existing benchmarks overly focus on coarse-grained task completion while
neglecting fine-grained control capabilities crucial for real-world
applications. To address this, we introduce FineState-Bench, the first
evaluation and diagnostic standard for fine-grained GUI proxy operations,
designed to quantify fine-grained control. This multi-platform (desktop, Web,
mobile) framework includes 2257 task benchmarks in four components and uses a
four-phase indicator for comprehensive perception-to-control assessment. To
analyze perception and positioning for refined operations, we developed the
plug-and-play Visual Diagnostic Assistant (VDA), enabling the first
quantitative decoupling analysis of these capabilities. Experimental results on
our benchmark show that the most advanced models achieve only 32.8%
fine-grained interaction accuracy. Using our VDA in controlled experiments,
quantifying the impact of visual capabilities, we showed that ideal visual
localization boosts Gemini-2.5-Flash's success rate by 14.9\%. Our diagnostic
framework confirms for the first time that the primary bottleneck for current
GUI proxies is basic visual positioning capability.All resources are fully

Motivation: 针对视觉助手系统中盲人和低视力用户可能无意中捕获隐私信息的问题，现有方法因粗粒度分割导致可用性降低。

Method: 结合细粒度分割和数据驱动的风险评分机制，选择性屏蔽高风险隐私信息。

Result: 在BIV-Priv-Seg数据集上测试，FiGPriv保留26%的图像内容，提升模型响应能力11%，识别能力45%。

Conclusion: FiGPriv在保护隐私的同时显著提升了视觉语言模型的可用性和功能。

Abstract: As visual assistant systems powered by visual language models (VLMs) become
more prevalent, concerns over user privacy have grown, particularly for blind
and low vision users who may unknowingly capture personal private information
in their images. Existing privacy protection methods rely on coarse-grained
segmentation, which uniformly masks entire private objects, often at the cost
of usability. In this work, we propose FiGPriv, a fine-grained privacy
protection framework that selectively masks only high-risk private information
while preserving low-risk information. Our approach integrates fine-grained
segmentation with a data-driven risk scoring mechanism. We evaluate our
framework using the BIV-Priv-Seg dataset and show that FiG-Priv preserves +26%
of image content, enhancing the ability of VLMs to provide useful responses by
11% and identify the image content by 45%, while ensuring privacy protection.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型输入自适应导航方法，通过三种算法提升视觉与语言导航（VLN）模型的效率，显著减少计算量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有输入自适应机制在减少计算量的同时会导致性能显著下降，因此需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 1. 选择性处理全景视图提升空间效率；2. 基于重要性的自适应阈值用于早期退出方法；3. 缓存机制避免重复处理已观察视图。

Result: 在七个VLN基准测试中，计算量减少超过2倍，且性能未显著下降。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效提升了VLN模型的效率，适用于计算资源有限的场景。

Abstract: An emerging paradigm in vision-and-language navigation (VLN) is the use of
history-aware multi-modal transformer models. Given a language instruction,
these models process observation and navigation history to predict the most
appropriate action for an agent. While they have significantly improved
performance, the scale of these models can be a bottleneck in practical
settings with limited computational resources. In this work, we propose a novel
input-adaptive navigation method to enhance VLN model efficiency. We first show
that existing input-adaptive mechanisms fail to reduce computations without
substantial performance degradation. To address this, we introduce three
adaptive algorithms, each deployed at a different level: (1) To improve spatial
efficiency, we selectively process panoramic views at each observation of an
agent. (2) To improve intra-model efficiency, we propose importance-based
adaptive thresholding for the early-exit methods. (3) To improve temporal
efficiency, we implement a caching mechanism that prevents reprocessing of
views previously seen by the agent. In evaluations on seven VLN benchmarks, we
demonstrate over a 2$\times$ reduction in computation across three
off-the-shelf agents in both standard and continuous environments. Our code is

Motivation: 视觉强化学习需要从高维输入和噪声奖励中学习感知和动作，现有大模型在RL中的整合效果不明确，SegDAC旨在解决这一问题。

Method: SegDAC结合SAM进行对象中心分解，YOLO-World通过文本提示语义标注，采用新型Transformer架构动态选择关注的分割区域。

Result: 在Maniskill3基准测试中，SegDAC在视觉泛化能力上表现优异，最难任务性能翻倍，样本效率优于或匹配现有方法。

Conclusion: SegDAC通过对象中心分割和动态注意力机制，显著提升了视觉强化学习的泛化能力和效率。

Abstract: Visual reinforcement learning (RL) is challenging due to the need to learn
both perception and actions from high-dimensional inputs and noisy rewards.
Although large perception models exist, integrating them effectively into RL
for visual generalization and improved sample efficiency remains unclear. We
propose SegDAC, a Segmentation-Driven Actor-Critic method. SegDAC uses Segment
Anything (SAM) for object-centric decomposition and YOLO-World to ground
segments semantically via text prompts. It includes a novel transformer-based
architecture that supports a dynamic number of segments at each time step and
effectively learns which segments to focus on using online RL, without using
human labels. By evaluating SegDAC over a challenging visual generalization
benchmark using Maniskill3, which covers diverse manipulation tasks under
strong visual perturbations, we demonstrate that SegDAC achieves significantly
better visual generalization, doubling prior performance on the hardest setting
and matching or surpassing prior methods in sample efficiency across all
evaluated tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成模型在肺部癌症诊断中效率低且解剖不精确，限制了临床适用性。

Method: 提出Lung-DDPM+，一种基于结节语义布局的DDPM模型，通过肺部DPM-solver加速，优化采样效率与质量。

Result: 在LIDC-IDRI数据集上，模型减少了8倍FLOPs、6.8倍GPU内存消耗，采样速度提升14倍，同时保持样本质量。

Conclusion: Lung-DDPM+能高效生成高质量肺部CT图像，具有广泛临床应用潜力。

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has been playing an important role in
various domains. Leveraging its high capability to generate high-fidelity and
diverse synthetic data, generative AI is widely applied in diagnostic tasks,
such as lung cancer diagnosis using computed tomography (CT). However, existing
generative models for lung cancer diagnosis suffer from low efficiency and
anatomical imprecision, which limit their clinical applicability. To address
these drawbacks, we propose Lung-DDPM+, an improved version of our previous
model, Lung-DDPM. This novel approach is a denoising diffusion probabilistic
model (DDPM) guided by nodule semantic layouts and accelerated by a pulmonary
DPM-solver, enabling the method to focus on lesion areas while achieving a
better trade-off between sampling efficiency and quality. Evaluation results on
the public LIDC-IDRI dataset suggest that the proposed method achieves
8$\times$ fewer FLOPs (floating point operations per second), 6.8$\times$ lower
GPU memory consumption, and 14$\times$ faster sampling compared to Lung-DDPM.
Moreover, it maintains comparable sample quality to both Lung-DDPM and other
state-of-the-art (SOTA) generative models in two downstream segmentation tasks.
We also conducted a Visual Turing Test by an experienced radiologist, showing
the advanced quality and fidelity of synthetic samples generated by the
proposed method. These experimental results demonstrate that Lung-DDPM+ can
effectively generate high-quality thoracic CT images with lung nodules,
highlighting its potential for broader applications, such as general tumor
synthesis and lesion generation in medical imaging. The code and pretrained
models are available at https://github.com/Manem-Lab/Lung-DDPM-PLUS.

Conclusion: 基于注意力融合的多样化时空网络集成方法为复杂多模态手势识别提供了鲁棒且准确的框架。

Abstract: Accurate recognition of sign language in healthcare communication poses a
significant challenge, requiring frameworks that can accurately interpret
complex multimodal gestures. To deal with this, we propose FusionEnsemble-Net,
a novel attention-based ensemble of spatiotemporal networks that dynamically
fuses visual and motion data to enhance recognition accuracy. The proposed
approach processes RGB video and range Doppler map radar modalities
synchronously through four different spatiotemporal networks. For each network,
features from both modalities are continuously fused using an attention-based
fusion module before being fed into an ensemble of classifiers. Finally, the
outputs of these four different fused channels are combined in an ensemble
classification head, thereby enhancing the model's robustness. Experiments
demonstrate that FusionEnsemble-Net outperforms state-of-the-art approaches
with a test accuracy of 99.44% on the large-scale MultiMeDaLIS dataset for
Italian Sign Language. Our findings indicate that an ensemble of diverse
spatiotemporal networks, unified by attention-based fusion, yields a robust and
accurate framework for complex, multimodal isolated gesture recognition tasks.

Motivation: 解决连续手语识别（CSLR）中说话者间差异大和对新句子结构泛化能力差的问题。

Method: 提出双架构框架：Signer-Invariant Conformer用于SI任务，结合卷积和多头自注意力；Multi-Scale Fusion Transformer用于US任务，采用双路径时间编码器。

Result: 在Isharah-1000数据集上，SI任务WER降至13.07%（提升13.53%），US任务WER为47.78%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 任务特定网络设计能显著提升CSLR性能，为后续研究设定了新基准。

Abstract: Continuous Sign Language Recognition (CSLR) faces multiple challenges,
including significant inter-signer variability and poor generalization to novel
sentence structures. Traditional solutions frequently fail to handle these
issues efficiently. For overcoming these constraints, we propose a
dual-architecture framework. For the Signer-Independent (SI) challenge, we
propose a Signer-Invariant Conformer that combines convolutions with multi-head
self-attention to learn robust, signer-agnostic representations from pose-based
skeletal keypoints. For the Unseen-Sentences (US) task, we designed a
Multi-Scale Fusion Transformer with a novel dual-path temporal encoder that
captures both fine-grained posture dynamics, enabling the model's ability to
comprehend novel grammatical compositions. Experiments on the challenging
Isharah-1000 dataset establish a new standard for both CSLR benchmarks. The
proposed conformer architecture achieves a Word Error Rate (WER) of 13.07% on
the SI challenge, a reduction of 13.53% from the state-of-the-art. On the US
task, the transformer model scores a WER of 47.78%, surpassing previous work.
In the SignEval 2025 CSLR challenge, our team placed 2nd in the US task and 4th
in the SI task, demonstrating the performance of these models. The findings
validate our key hypothesis: that developing task-specific networks designed
for the particular challenges of CSLR leads to considerable performance
improvements and establishes a new baseline for further research. The source

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割中注释者间的变异性问题，尤其是模糊边界病变（如恶性皮肤病变）的注释不一致性，需要深入研究。

Method: 通过构建IMA++数据集，研究注释者、恶性程度、工具和技能对变异性的影响，并利用IAA预测和多任务学习提升模型性能。

Result: 发现恶性程度与IAA显著相关（p<0.001），IAA预测误差为0.108，多任务学习方法使平衡准确率提升4.2%。

Conclusion: IAA可作为临床特征提升分割模型性能，尤其在模糊边界病变中具有应用潜力。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation exhibits intra- and inter-annotator variability
due to ambiguous object boundaries, annotator preferences, expertise, and
tools, among other factors. Lesions with ambiguous boundaries, e.g., spiculated
or infiltrative nodules, or irregular borders per the ABCD rule, are
particularly prone to disagreement and are often associated with malignancy. In
this work, we curate IMA++, the largest multi-annotator skin lesion
segmentation dataset, on which we conduct an in-depth study of variability due
to annotator, malignancy, tool, and skill factors. We find a statistically
significant (p<0.001) association between inter-annotator agreement (IAA),
measured using Dice, and the malignancy of skin lesions. We further show that
IAA can be accurately predicted directly from dermoscopic images, achieving a
mean absolute error of 0.108. Finally, we leverage this association by
utilizing IAA as a "soft" clinical feature within a multi-task learning
objective, yielding a 4.2% improvement in balanced accuracy averaged across
multiple model architectures and across IMA++ and four public dermoscopic
datasets. The code is available at https://github.com/sfu-mial/skin-IAV.

Method: 提出了一种自监督的端到端框架，将多粒度运动编码为四个解耦的潜在标记（面部、身体、双手）。通过2D和3D增强技术实现运动与身份的分离，并利用辅助解码器优化潜在标记学习。

Conclusion: X-UniMotion通过隐式潜在表示和自监督学习，实现了高保真、跨身份的运动迁移，为全身运动建模提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We present X-UniMotion, a unified and expressive implicit latent
representation for whole-body human motion, encompassing facial expressions,
body poses, and hand gestures. Unlike prior motion transfer methods that rely
on explicit skeletal poses and heuristic cross-identity adjustments, our
approach encodes multi-granular motion directly from a single image into a
compact set of four disentangled latent tokens -- one for facial expression,
one for body pose, and one for each hand. These motion latents are both highly
expressive and identity-agnostic, enabling high-fidelity, detailed
cross-identity motion transfer across subjects with diverse identities, poses,
and spatial configurations. To achieve this, we introduce a self-supervised,
end-to-end framework that jointly learns the motion encoder and latent
representation alongside a DiT-based video generative model, trained on
large-scale, diverse human motion datasets. Motion-identity disentanglement is
enforced via 2D spatial and color augmentations, as well as synthetic 3D
renderings of cross-identity subject pairs under shared poses. Furthermore, we
guide motion token learning with auxiliary decoders that promote fine-grained,
semantically aligned, and depth-aware motion embeddings. Extensive experiments
show that X-UniMotion outperforms state-of-the-art methods, producing highly
expressive animations with superior motion fidelity and identity preservation.

Result: 在MP3D和Gibson上达到SOTA性能，并在HM3D上表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: GOAL通过生成流模型和LLM先验的结合，显著提升了ObjectNav任务的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: The Object Goal Navigation (ObjectNav) task challenges agents to locate a
specified object in an unseen environment by imagining unobserved regions of
the scene. Prior approaches rely on deterministic and discriminative models to
complete semantic maps, overlooking the inherent uncertainty in indoor layouts
and limiting their ability to generalize to unseen environments. In this work,
we propose GOAL, a generative flow-based framework that models the semantic
distribution of indoor environments by bridging observed regions with
LLM-enriched full-scene semantic maps. During training, spatial priors inferred
from large language models (LLMs) are encoded as two-dimensional Gaussian
fields and injected into target maps, distilling rich contextual knowledge into
the flow model and enabling more generalizable completions. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that GOAL achieves state-of-the-art performance on MP3D
and Gibson, and shows strong generalization in transfer settings to HM3D. Codes

Motivation: 解决SAR目标检测中相干噪声的普遍影响，现有方法多基于空间域特征分析或增强，缺乏对变换域特征的探索。

Method: 设计了一种注意力架构，通过波段互调机制利用振幅和相位信息的互补性，实现相位和振幅谱的相互增强。

Conclusion: DenoDet V2通过变换域特征调制，显著提升了SAR目标检测性能，且模型更高效。

Abstract: One of the primary challenges in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) object
detection lies in the pervasive influence of coherent noise. As a common
practice, most existing methods, whether handcrafted approaches or deep
learning-based methods, employ the analysis or enhancement of object
spatial-domain characteristics to achieve implicit denoising. In this paper, we
propose DenoDet V2, which explores a completely novel and different perspective
to deconstruct and modulate the features in the transform domain via a
carefully designed attention architecture. Compared to DenoDet V1, DenoDet V2
is a major advancement that exploits the complementary nature of amplitude and
phase information through a band-wise mutual modulation mechanism, which
enables a reciprocal enhancement between phase and amplitude spectra. Extensive
experiments on various SAR datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art
performance of DenoDet V2. Notably, DenoDet V2 achieves a significant 0.8\%
improvement on SARDet-100K dataset compared to DenoDet V1, while reducing the
model complexity by half. The code is available at

Conclusion: WeatherPrompt通过多模态融合和动态门控机制，显著提升了无人机在复杂天气条件下的地理定位性能。

Abstract: Visual geo-localization for drones faces critical degradation under weather
perturbations, \eg, rain and fog, where existing methods struggle with two
inherent limitations: 1) Heavy reliance on limited weather categories that
constrain generalization, and 2) Suboptimal disentanglement of entangled
scene-weather features through pseudo weather categories. We present
WeatherPrompt, a multi-modality learning paradigm that establishes
weather-invariant representations through fusing the image embedding with the
text context. Our framework introduces two key contributions: First, a
Training-free Weather Reasoning mechanism that employs off-the-shelf large
multi-modality models to synthesize multi-weather textual descriptions through
human-like reasoning. It improves the scalability to unseen or complex weather,
and could reflect different weather strength. Second, to better disentangle the
scene and weather feature, we propose a multi-modality framework with the
dynamic gating mechanism driven by the text embedding to adaptively reweight
and fuse visual features across modalities. The framework is further optimized
by the cross-modal objectives, including image-text contrastive learning and
image-text matching, which maps the same scene with different weather
conditions closer in the respresentation space. Extensive experiments validate
that, under diverse weather conditions, our method achieves competitive recall
rates compared to state-of-the-art drone geo-localization methods. Notably, it
improves Recall@1 by +13.37\% under night conditions and by 18.69\% under fog

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于模型信息优化的平面检测框架，解决了RANSAC在复杂场景中易产生假阳性检测的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RANSAC在复杂场景中因内点阈值模糊而易产生假阳性平面检测，需一种更客观的方法。

Method: 将深度观测视为离散随机变量，通过随机子采样生成候选平面模型，利用信息优化选择最可能的地面真实模型。

Result: 实验表明，算法比Open3D RANSAC更准确地估计平面参数，并通过神经网络分割加速。

Conclusion: 信息优化框架有效减少假阳性检测，提升平面检测的准确性和实用性。

Abstract: Plane detection from depth images is a crucial subtask with broad robotic
applications, often accomplished by iterative methods such as Random Sample
Consensus (RANSAC). While RANSAC is a robust strategy with strong probabilistic
guarantees, the ambiguity of its inlier threshold criterion makes it
susceptible to false positive plane detections. This issue is particularly
prevalent in complex real-world scenes, where the true number of planes is
unknown and multiple planes coexist. In this paper, we aim to address this
limitation by proposing a generalised framework for plane detection based on
model information optimization. Building on previous works, we treat the
observed depth readings as discrete random variables, with their probability
distributions constrained by the ground truth planes. Various models containing
different candidate plane constraints are then generated through repeated
random sub-sampling to explain our observations. By incorporating the physics
and noise model of the depth sensor, we can calculate the information for each
model, and the model with the least information is accepted as the most likely
ground truth. This information optimization process serves as an objective
mechanism for determining the true number of planes and preventing false
positive detections. Additionally, the quality of each detected plane can be
ranked by summing the information reduction of inlier points for each plane. We
validate these properties through experiments with synthetic data and find that
our algorithm estimates plane parameters more accurately compared to the
default Open3D RANSAC plane segmentation. Furthermore, we accelerate our
algorithm by partitioning the depth map using neural network segmentation,
which enhances its ability to generate more realistic plane parameters in
real-world data.

Abstract: This paper presents a low cost, on premise system for autonomous backyard
bird monitoring in Belgian urban gardens. A motion triggered IP camera uploads
short clips via FTP to a local server, where frames are sampled and birds are
localized with Detectron2; cropped regions are then classified by an
EfficientNet-B3 model fine tuned on a 40-species Belgian subset derived from a
larger Kaggle corpus. All processing runs on commodity hardware without a
discrete GPU, preserving privacy and avoiding cloud fees. The physical feeder
uses small entry ports (30 mm) to exclude pigeons and reduce nuisance triggers.
Detector-guided cropping improves classification accuracy over raw-frame
classification. The classifier attains high validation performance on the
curated subset (about 99.5 percent) and delivers practical field accuracy
(top-1 about 88 percent) on held-out species, demonstrating feasibility for
citizen-science-grade biodiversity logging at home.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于NeRF的新型测试时优化（TTO）方法，用于长期3D点跟踪，结合了可逆神经辐射场（InvNeRF）架构，在2D和3D跟踪中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前点跟踪方法在长期一致性或3D运动方面表现不足，需要一种能够结合多方法优势并适应手术场景的解决方案。

Method: 采用InvNeRF架构，结合渲染监督和双向可变形-规范映射，提出多尺度HexPlanes和高效像素采样算法。

Result: 在STIR和SCARE数据集上，2D跟踪精度提升50%，3D跟踪首次实现TTO方法超越前馈方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在2D和3D点跟踪中均表现出色，为手术场景提供了高效且精确的解决方案。

Abstract: We proposed a novel test-time optimisation (TTO) approach framed by a
NeRF-based architecture for long-term 3D point tracking. Most current methods
in point tracking struggle to obtain consistent motion or are limited to 2D
motion. TTO approaches frame the solution for long-term tracking as optimising
a function that aggregates correspondences from other specialised
state-of-the-art methods. Unlike the state-of-the-art on TTO, we propose
parametrising such a function with our new invertible Neural Radiance Field
(InvNeRF) architecture to perform both 2D and 3D tracking in surgical
scenarios. Our approach allows us to exploit the advantages of a
rendering-based approach by supervising the reprojection of pixel
correspondences. It adapts strategies from recent rendering-based methods to
obtain a bidirectional deformable-canonical mapping, to efficiently handle a
defined workspace, and to guide the rays' density. It also presents our
multi-scale HexPlanes for fast inference and a new algorithm for efficient
pixel sampling and convergence criteria. We present results in the STIR and
SCARE datasets, for evaluating point tracking and testing the integration of
kinematic data in our pipeline, respectively. In 2D point tracking, our
approach surpasses the precision and accuracy of the TTO state-of-the-art
methods by nearly 50% on average precision, while competing with other
approaches. In 3D point tracking, this is the first TTO approach, surpassing
feed-forward methods while incorporating the benefits of a deformable
NeRF-based reconstruction.

Conclusion: Waymo-3DSkelMo为复杂城市环境中细粒度人类行为理解提供了基础资源，并建立了3D姿态预测基准。

Abstract: Large-scale high-quality 3D motion datasets with multi-person interactions
are crucial for data-driven models in autonomous driving to achieve
fine-grained pedestrian interaction understanding in dynamic urban
environments. However, existing datasets mostly rely on estimating 3D poses
from monocular RGB video frames, which suffer from occlusion and lack of
temporal continuity, thus resulting in unrealistic and low-quality human
motion. In this paper, we introduce Waymo-3DSkelMo, the first large-scale
dataset providing high-quality, temporally coherent 3D skeletal motions with
explicit interaction semantics, derived from the Waymo Perception dataset. Our
key insight is to utilize 3D human body shape and motion priors to enhance the
quality of the 3D pose sequences extracted from the raw LiDRA point clouds. The
dataset covers over 14,000 seconds across more than 800 real driving scenarios,
including rich interactions among an average of 27 agents per scene (with up to
250 agents in the largest scene). Furthermore, we establish 3D pose forecasting
benchmarks under varying pedestrian densities, and the results demonstrate its
value as a foundational resource for future research on fine-grained human
behavior understanding in complex urban environments. The dataset and code will

Abstract: Recent advances in data-driven computer vision have enabled robust autonomous
navigation capabilities for civil aviation, including automated landing and
runway detection. However, ensuring that these systems meet the robustness and
safety requirements for aviation applications remains a major challenge. In
this work, we present a practical vision-based pipeline for aircraft pose
estimation from runway images that represents a step toward the ability to
certify these systems for use in safety-critical aviation applications. Our
approach features three key innovations: (i) an efficient, flexible neural
architecture based on a spatial Soft Argmax operator for probabilistic keypoint
regression, supporting diverse vision backbones with real-time inference; (ii)
a principled loss function producing calibrated predictive uncertainties, which
are evaluated via sharpness and calibration metrics; and (iii) an adaptation of
Residual-based Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM), enabling
runtime detection and rejection of faulty model outputs. We implement and
evaluate our pose estimation pipeline on a dataset of runway images. We show
that our model outperforms baseline architectures in terms of accuracy while
also producing well-calibrated uncertainty estimates with sub-pixel precision
that can be used downstream for fault detection.

Conclusion: 研究贡献了首个大规模高质量路缘坡道检测数据集、基准和模型，解决了数据不足问题。

Abstract: Curb ramps are critical for urban accessibility, but robustly detecting them
in images remains an open problem due to the lack of large-scale, high-quality
datasets. While prior work has attempted to improve data availability with
crowdsourced or manually labeled data, these efforts often fall short in either
quality or scale. In this paper, we introduce and evaluate a two-stage pipeline
called RampNet to scale curb ramp detection datasets and improve model
performance. In Stage 1, we generate a dataset of more than 210,000 annotated
Google Street View (GSV) panoramas by auto-translating government-provided curb
ramp location data to pixel coordinates in panoramic images. In Stage 2, we
train a curb ramp detection model (modified ConvNeXt V2) from the generated
dataset, achieving state-of-the-art performance. To evaluate both stages of our
pipeline, we compare to manually labeled panoramas. Our generated dataset
achieves 94.0% precision and 92.5% recall, and our detection model reaches
0.9236 AP -- far exceeding prior work. Our work contributes the first
large-scale, high-quality curb ramp detection dataset, benchmark, and model.

Motivation: 现有方法在缺乏人工标签时难以学习复杂运动物理，或需要额外标签（如物体类型或掩码）。

Method: 将每个3D点建模为具有大小和方向的刚性粒子，直接学习其平移旋转动力学系统，并显式估计物理参数。

Result: 在三个现有动态数据集和一个新合成数据集上，TRACE在帧外推任务中表现优于基线方法。

Conclusion: TRACE不仅能建模复杂运动物理，还能通过聚类物理参数轻松分割多个物体或部分。

Abstract: In this paper, we aim to model 3D scene geometry, appearance, and physical
information just from dynamic multi-view videos in the absence of any human
labels. By leveraging physics-informed losses as soft constraints or
integrating simple physics models into neural nets, existing works often fail
to learn complex motion physics, or doing so requires additional labels such as
object types or masks. We propose a new framework named TRACE to model the
motion physics of complex dynamic 3D scenes. The key novelty of our method is
that, by formulating each 3D point as a rigid particle with size and
orientation in space, we directly learn a translation rotation dynamics system
for each particle, explicitly estimating a complete set of physical parameters
to govern the particle's motion over time. Extensive experiments on three
existing dynamic datasets and one newly created challenging synthetic datasets
demonstrate the extraordinary performance of our method over baselines in the
task of future frame extrapolation. A nice property of our framework is that
multiple objects or parts can be easily segmented just by clustering the
learned physical parameters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法未能同时建模动作语义和空间上下文，需填补这一空白。

Method: PaIR-Net框架包含三个模块：CPAM、PGCS和IIM，分别用于识别接触相关身体部位、像素级接触分割和整合全局交互关系。

Result: 实验表明PaIR-Net显著优于基线方法，消融研究验证了各模块的有效性。

Conclusion: PaIR-Net和PaIR数据集为同时理解动作语义和空间上下文提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: People control their bodies to establish contact with the environment. To
comprehensively understand actions across diverse visual contexts, it is
essential to simultaneously consider \textbf{what} action is occurring and
\textbf{where} it is happening. Current methodologies, however, often
inadequately capture this duality, typically failing to jointly model both
action semantics and their spatial contextualization within scenes. To bridge
this gap, we introduce a novel vision task that simultaneously predicts
high-level action semantics and fine-grained body-part contact regions. Our
proposed framework, PaIR-Net, comprises three key components: the Contact Prior
Aware Module (CPAM) for identifying contact-relevant body parts, the
Prior-Guided Concat Segmenter (PGCS) for pixel-wise contact segmentation, and
the Interaction Inference Module (IIM) responsible for integrating global
interaction relationships. To facilitate this task, we present PaIR (Part-aware
Interaction Representation), a comprehensive dataset containing 13,979 images
that encompass 654 actions, 80 object categories, and 17 body parts.
Experimental evaluation demonstrates that PaIR-Net significantly outperforms
baseline approaches, while ablation studies confirm the efficacy of each
architectural component. The code and dataset will be released upon
publication.

Motivation: 微表情识别在情感计算领域具有广泛应用，但由于标注困难，数据集样本稀缺，现有预训练模型难以捕捉微表情的短暂和细微特征。

Method: 提出MPT方法，包括运动提示生成（运动放大和高斯标记化）和组适配器设计，以增强LMs在MER任务中的表现。

Result: 在三个广泛使用的MER数据集上的实验表明，MPT方法优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: MPT方法通过运动提示和适配器设计，成功解决了MER任务中预训练模型的局限性，为微表情识别提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Micro-expression recognition (MER) is crucial in the affective computing
field due to its wide application in medical diagnosis, lie detection, and
criminal investigation. Despite its significance, obtaining micro-expression
(ME) annotations is challenging due to the expertise required from
psychological professionals. Consequently, ME datasets often suffer from a
scarcity of training samples, severely constraining the learning of MER models.
While current large pre-training models (LMs) offer general and discriminative
representations, their direct application to MER is hindered by an inability to
capture transitory and subtle facial movements-essential elements for effective
MER. This paper introduces Motion Prompt Tuning (MPT) as a novel approach to
adapting LMs for MER, representing a pioneering method for subtle motion prompt
tuning. Particularly, we introduce motion prompt generation, including motion
magnification and Gaussian tokenization, to extract subtle motions as prompts
for LMs. Additionally, a group adapter is carefully designed and inserted into
the LM to enhance it in the target MER domain, facilitating a more nuanced
distinction of ME representation. Furthermore, extensive experiments conducted
on three widely used MER datasets demonstrate that our proposed MPT
consistently surpasses state-of-the-art approaches and verifies its
effectiveness.

Method: 提出RASR框架，包括语义参考检索器和基于扩散的RefSR生成器。构建RASR-Flickr30基准数据集支持开放检索。

Result: RASRNet在PSNR和LPIPS指标上优于SISR基线，生成更真实的纹理。

Conclusion: 检索增强是连接学术研究与实际应用的有效方向。

Abstract: Reference-based Super Resolution (RefSR) improves upon Single Image Super
Resolution (SISR) by leveraging high-quality reference images to enhance
texture fidelity and visual realism. However, a critical limitation of existing
RefSR approaches is their reliance on manually curated target-reference image
pairs, which severely constrains their practicality in real-world scenarios. To
overcome this, we introduce Retrieval-Augmented Super Resolution (RASR), a new
and practical RefSR paradigm that automatically retrieves semantically relevant
high-resolution images from a reference database given only a low-quality
input. This enables scalable and flexible RefSR in realistic use cases, such as
enhancing mobile photos taken in environments like zoos or museums, where
category-specific reference data (e.g., animals, artworks) can be readily
collected or pre-curated. To facilitate research in this direction, we
construct RASR-Flickr30, the first benchmark dataset designed for RASR. Unlike
prior datasets with fixed target-reference pairs, RASR-Flickr30 provides
per-category reference databases to support open-world retrieval. We further
propose RASRNet, a strong baseline that combines a semantic reference retriever
with a diffusion-based RefSR generator. It retrieves relevant references based
on semantic similarity and employs a diffusion-based generator enhanced with
semantic conditioning. Experiments on RASR-Flickr30 demonstrate that RASRNet
consistently improves over SISR baselines, achieving +0.38 dB PSNR and -0.0131
LPIPS, while generating more realistic textures. These findings highlight
retrieval augmentation as a promising direction to bridge the gap between
academic RefSR research and real-world applicability.

Abstract: The proliferation of foundation models, pretrained on large-scale unlabeled
datasets, has emerged as an effective approach in creating adaptable and
reusable architectures that can be leveraged for various downstream tasks using
satellite observations. However, their direct application to hyperspectral
remote sensing remains challenging due to inherent spectral disparities and the
scarcity of available observations. In this work, we present HyperKD, a novel
knowledge distillation framework that enables transferring learned
representations from a teacher model into a student model for effective
development of a foundation model on hyperspectral images. Unlike typical
knowledge distillation frameworks, which use a complex teacher to guide a
simpler student, HyperKD enables an inverse form of knowledge transfer across
different types of spectral data, guided by a simpler teacher model. Building
upon a Masked Autoencoder, HyperKD distills knowledge from the Prithvi
foundational model into a student tailored for EnMAP hyperspectral imagery.
HyperKD addresses the inverse domain adaptation problem with spectral gaps by
introducing a feature-based strategy that includes spectral range-based channel
alignment, spatial feature-guided masking, and an enhanced loss function
tailored for hyperspectral images. HyperKD bridges the substantial spectral
domain gap, enabling the effective use of pretrained foundation models for
geospatial applications. Extensive experiments show that HyperKD significantly
improves representation learning in MAEs, leading to enhanced reconstruction
fidelity and more robust performance on downstream tasks such as land cover
classification, crop type identification, and soil organic carbon prediction,
underpinning the potential of knowledge distillation frameworks in remote
sensing analytics with hyperspectral imagery.

Result: 实验表明 Animate-X++ 在通用性和广泛适用性上表现优越。

Conclusion: Animate-X++ 解决了现有方法的局限性，提升了动画的真实感和泛化能力。

Abstract: Character image animation, which generates high-quality videos from a
reference image and target pose sequence, has seen significant progress in
recent years. However, most existing methods only apply to human figures, which
usually do not generalize well on anthropomorphic characters commonly used in
industries like gaming and entertainment. Furthermore, previous methods could
only generate videos with static backgrounds, which limits the realism of the
videos. For the first challenge, our in-depth analysis suggests to attribute
this limitation to their insufficient modeling of motion, which is unable to
comprehend the movement pattern of the driving video, thus imposing a pose
sequence rigidly onto the target character. To this end, this paper proposes
Animate-X++, a universal animation framework based on DiT for various character
types, including anthropomorphic characters. To enhance motion representation,
we introduce the Pose Indicator, which captures comprehensive motion pattern
from the driving video through both implicit and explicit manner. The former
leverages CLIP visual features of a driving video to extract its gist of
motion, like the overall movement pattern and temporal relations among motions,
while the latter strengthens the generalization of DiT by simulating possible
inputs in advance that may arise during inference. For the second challenge, we
introduce a multi-task training strategy that jointly trains the animation and
TI2V tasks. Combined with the proposed partial parameter training, this
approach achieves not only character animation but also text-driven background
dynamics, making the videos more realistic. Moreover, we introduce a new
Animated Anthropomorphic Benchmark (A2Bench) to evaluate the performance of
Animate-X++ on universal and widely applicable animation images. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of Animate-X++.

Conclusion: IAG展示了后门攻击在视觉语言模型中的可行性和有效性，具有鲁棒性和可迁移性。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown significant advancements in tasks
such as visual grounding, where they localize specific objects in images based
on natural language queries and images. However, security issues in visual
grounding tasks for VLMs remain underexplored, especially in the context of
backdoor attacks. In this paper, we introduce a novel input-aware backdoor
attack method, IAG, designed to manipulate the grounding behavior of VLMs. This
attack forces the model to ground a specific target object in the input image,
regardless of the user's query. We propose an adaptive trigger generator that
embeds the semantic information of the attack target's description into the
original image using a text-conditional U-Net, thereby overcoming the
open-vocabulary attack challenge. To ensure the attack's stealthiness, we
utilize a reconstruction loss to minimize visual discrepancies between poisoned
and clean images. Additionally, we introduce a unified method for generating
attack data. IAG is evaluated theoretically and empirically, demonstrating its
feasibility and effectiveness. Notably, our ASR@0.5 on InternVL-2.5-8B reaches
over 65\% on various testing sets. IAG also shows promising potential on

Motivation: 现有方法在跨模态泛化和处理高分辨率或长时间输入方面表现不佳，需要一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: 采用灵活的局部单元和GLoRA机制，结合轻量级适配模块与现有Transformer骨干网络（如ViT和SegFormer）无缝集成。

Result: 在多个基准测试中达到最先进的定位性能，为可扩展和模态无关的VML设定了新基准。

Conclusion: RelayFormer通过模块化设计和高效处理能力，为视觉篡改定位任务提供了强大的解决方案。

Abstract: Visual manipulation localization (VML) -- across both images and videos -- is
a crucial task in digital forensics that involves identifying tampered regions
in visual content. However, existing methods often lack cross-modal
generalization and struggle to handle high-resolution or long-duration inputs
efficiently.
  We propose RelayFormer, a unified and modular architecture for visual
manipulation localization across images and videos. By leveraging flexible
local units and a Global-Local Relay Attention (GLoRA) mechanism, it enables
scalable, resolution-agnostic processing with strong generalization. Our
framework integrates seamlessly with existing Transformer-based backbones, such
as ViT and SegFormer, via lightweight adaptation modules that require only
minimal architectural changes, ensuring compatibility without disrupting
pretrained representations.
  Furthermore, we design a lightweight, query-based mask decoder that supports
one-shot inference across video sequences with linear complexity. Extensive
experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art localization performance, setting a new baseline for scalable
and modality-agnostic VML. Code is available at:

Abstract: Different forms of customized 2D avatars are widely used in gaming
applications, virtual communication, education, and content creation. However,
existing approaches often fail to capture fine-grained facial expressions and
struggle to preserve identity across different expressions. We propose
GEN-AFFECT, a novel framework for personalized avatar generation that generates
expressive and identity-consistent avatars with a diverse set of facial
expressions. Our framework proposes conditioning a multimodal diffusion
transformer on an extracted identity-expression representation. This enables
identity preservation and representation of a wide range of facial expressions.
GEN-AFFECT additionally employs consistent attention at inference for
information sharing across the set of generated expressions, enabling the
generation process to maintain identity consistency over the array of generated
fine-grained expressions. GEN-AFFECT demonstrates superior performance compared
to previous state-of-the-art methods on the basis of the accuracy of the
generated expressions, the preservation of the identity and the consistency of
the target identity across an array of fine-grained facial expressions.

Abstract: Robust fitting of geometric models is a fundamental task in many computer
vision pipelines. Numerous innovations have been produced on the topic, from
improving the efficiency and accuracy of random sampling heuristics to
generating novel theoretical insights that underpin new approaches with
mathematical guarantees. However, one aspect of robust fitting that has
received little attention is energy efficiency. This performance metric has
become critical as high energy consumption is a growing concern for AI
adoption. In this paper, we explore energy-efficient robust fitting via the
neuromorphic computing paradigm. Specifically, we designed a novel spiking
neural network for robust fitting on real neuromorphic hardware, the Intel
Loihi 2. Enabling this are novel event-driven formulations of model estimation
that allow robust fitting to be implemented in the unique architecture of Loihi
2, and algorithmic strategies to alleviate the current limited precision and
instruction set of the hardware. Results show that our neuromorphic robust
fitting consumes only a fraction (15%) of the energy required to run the
established robust fitting algorithm on a standard CPU to equivalent accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型因3D数据规模有限和数据集间的领域差距导致泛化能力下降，需要一种新方法来解决这些问题。

Method: 提出CitySeg模型，包括定制数据预处理规则、局部-全局交叉注意力网络、分层分类策略和两阶段训练策略。

Result: 在九个闭集基准测试中达到SOTA性能，并首次实现不依赖视觉信息的零样本泛化。

Conclusion: CitySeg通过创新方法显著提升了城市尺度点云语义分割的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of city-scale point clouds is a critical technology for
Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) perception systems, enabling the classification
of 3D points without relying on any visual information to achieve comprehensive
3D understanding. However, existing models are frequently constrained by the
limited scale of 3D data and the domain gap between datasets, which lead to
reduced generalization capability. To address these challenges, we propose
CitySeg, a foundation model for city-scale point cloud semantic segmentation
that incorporates text modality to achieve open vocabulary segmentation and
zero-shot inference. Specifically, in order to mitigate the issue of
non-uniform data distribution across multiple domains, we customize the data
preprocessing rules, and propose a local-global cross-attention network to
enhance the perception capabilities of point networks in UAV scenarios. To
resolve semantic label discrepancies across datasets, we introduce a
hierarchical classification strategy. A hierarchical graph established
according to the data annotation rules consolidates the data labels, and the
graph encoder is used to model the hierarchical relationships between
categories. In addition, we propose a two-stage training strategy and employ
hinge loss to increase the feature separability of subcategories. Experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed CitySeg achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA)
performance on nine closed-set benchmarks, significantly outperforming existing
approaches. Moreover, for the first time, CitySeg enables zero-shot
generalization in city-scale point cloud scenarios without relying on visual
information.

TL;DR: 论文提出Few-shot Training-free Network (FTNet)，用于小样本深度伪造检测，无需训练即可显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度伪造检测方法在未知样本上表现不佳，但现实中这些样本仍可用于分析，因此需将其视为小样本任务。

Method: FTNet仅需一个伪造样本作为参考，通过比较测试样本与已知样本的相似性进行分类，无需训练或参数更新。

Result: 在29种生成模型的测试中，FTNet平均性能提升8.7%，达到新SoTA。

Conclusion: 利用失败样本可提升小样本深度伪造检测性能，为实际应用提供新思路。

Abstract: Recent deepfake detection studies often treat unseen sample detection as a
``zero-shot" task, training on images generated by known models but
generalizing to unknown ones. A key real-world challenge arises when a model
performs poorly on unknown samples, yet these samples remain available for
analysis. This highlights that it should be approached as a ``few-shot" task,
where effectively utilizing a small number of samples can lead to significant
improvement. Unlike typical few-shot tasks focused on semantic understanding,
deepfake detection prioritizes image realism, which closely mirrors real-world
distributions. In this work, we propose the Few-shot Training-free Network
(FTNet) for real-world few-shot deepfake detection. Simple yet effective, FTNet
differs from traditional methods that rely on large-scale known data for
training. Instead, FTNet uses only one fake samplefrom an evaluation set,
mimicking the scenario where new samples emerge in the real world and can be
gathered for use, without any training or parameter updates. During evaluation,
each test sample is compared to the known fake and real samples, and it is
classified based on the category of the nearest sample. We conduct a
comprehensive analysis of AI-generated images from 29 different generative
models and achieve a new SoTA performance, with an average improvement of 8.7\%
compared to existing methods. This work introduces a fresh perspective on
real-world deepfake detection: when the model struggles to generalize on a
few-shot sample, leveraging the failed samples leads to better performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频生成模型在大角度面部时难以保持身份特征，主要因缺乏有效的身份特征整合机制和针对性数据集。

Method: 引入MoFE动态结合三种专家（身份、语义、细节），并设计数据处理流程（面部约束和身份一致性）构建LFA数据集。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在LFA基准测试中显著优于现有方法，提升了面部相似度、FID和CLIP语义对齐。

Conclusion: MoFE和LFA数据集有效解决了大角度面部身份保持问题，代码和数据集将开源。

Abstract: Current video generation models struggle with identity preservation under
large facial angles, primarily facing two challenges: the difficulty in
exploring an effective mechanism to integrate identity features into DiT
structure, and the lack of targeted coverage of large facial angles in existing
open-source video datasets. To address these, we present two key innovations.
First, we introduce a Mixture of Facial Experts (MoFE) that dynamically
combines complementary cues from three specialized experts, each designed to
capture distinct but mutually reinforcing aspects of facial attributes. The
identity expert captures cross-pose identity-sensitive features, the semantic
expert extracts high-level visual semantxics, and the detail expert preserves
pixel-level features (e.g., skin texture, color gradients). Furthermore, to
mitigate dataset limitations, we have tailored a data processing pipeline
centered on two key aspects: Face Constraints and Identity Consistency. Face
Constraints ensure facial angle diversity and a high proportion of facial
regions, while Identity Consistency preserves coherent person-specific features
across temporal sequences, collectively addressing the scarcity of large facial
angles and identity-stable training data in existing datasets. Leveraging this
pipeline, we have curated and refined a Large Face Angles (LFA) Dataset from
existing open-source human video datasets, comprising 460K video clips with
annotated facial angles. Experimental results on the LFA benchmark demonstrate
that our method, empowered by the LFA dataset, significantly outperforms prior
SOTA methods in face similarity, face FID, and CLIP semantic alignment. The
code and dataset will be made publicly available at
https://github.com/rain152/LFA-Video-Generation.

Result: 实验证明该方法对多种图像生成器生成的AI图像有效。

Conclusion: 提出的无监督方法在通用AI生成图像检测中表现优异。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of AI generative models, the visual quality of
AI-generated images (AIIs) has become increasingly close to natural images,
which inevitably raises security concerns. Most AII detectors often employ the
conventional image classification pipeline with natural images and AIIs
(generated by a generative model), which can result in limited detection
performance for AIIs from unseen generative models. To solve this, we proposed
a universal AI-generated image detector from the perspective of anomaly
detection. Our discriminator does not need to access any AIIs and learn a
generalizable representation with unsupervised learning. Specifically, we use
the pre-trained CLIP encoder as the feature extractor and design a normalizing
flow-like unsupervised model. Instead of AIIs, proxy images, e.g., obtained by
applying a spectral modification operation on natural images, are used for
training. Our models are trained by minimizing the likelihood of proxy images,
optionally combined with maximizing the likelihood of natural images. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on AIIs produced by
various image generators.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 放射科医生的视觉注意力模式包含细粒度和粗粒度疾病信息，将其融入深度学习框架可提升自动化图像解读能力。

Method: 利用视觉搜索过程的时间特性，通过整合与分解机制改进长尾疾病分类。

Result: 在NIH-CXR-LT和MIMIC-CXR-LT数据集上，GazeLT比最佳长尾损失方法提升4.1%，比视觉注意力基线提升21.7%。

Conclusion: GazeLT通过结合视觉注意力模式，显著提升了长尾疾病分类性能。

Abstract: In this work, we present GazeLT, a human visual attention
integration-disintegration approach for long-tailed disease classification. A
radiologist's eye gaze has distinct patterns that capture both fine-grained and
coarser level disease related information. While interpreting an image, a
radiologist's attention varies throughout the duration; it is critical to
incorporate this into a deep learning framework to improve automated image
interpretation. Another important aspect of visual attention is that apart from
looking at major/obvious disease patterns, experts also look at
minor/incidental findings (few of these constituting long-tailed classes)
during the course of image interpretation. GazeLT harnesses the temporal aspect
of the visual search process, via an integration and disintegration mechanism,
to improve long-tailed disease classification. We show the efficacy of GazeLT
on two publicly available datasets for long-tailed disease classification,
namely the NIH-CXR-LT (n=89237) and the MIMIC-CXR-LT (n=111898) datasets.
GazeLT outperforms the best long-tailed loss by 4.1% and the visual
attention-based baseline by 21.7% in average accuracy metrics for these
datasets. Our code is available at https://github.com/lordmoinak1/gazelt.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏卫星图像的三维重建存在挑战，现有方法因与RPC模型不兼容和泛化能力有限而表现不佳。

Method: SkySplat结合RPC模型和通用3DGS，利用RGB图像和辐射鲁棒的相对高度监督，通过CSCM模块和多视角一致性策略优化重建。

Result: SkySplat比EOGS快86倍且更准确，在DFC19数据集上MAE从13.18米降至1.80米，并在MVS3D基准上表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: SkySplat通过自监督和一致性策略，显著提升了稀疏卫星图像的三维重建效率和精度。

Abstract: Three-dimensional scene reconstruction from sparse-view satellite images is a
long-standing and challenging task. While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and its
variants have recently attracted attention for its high efficiency, existing
methods remain unsuitable for satellite images due to incompatibility with
rational polynomial coefficient (RPC) models and limited generalization
capability. Recent advances in generalizable 3DGS approaches show potential,
but they perform poorly on multi-temporal sparse satellite images due to
limited geometric constraints, transient objects, and radiometric
inconsistencies. To address these limitations, we propose SkySplat, a novel
self-supervised framework that integrates the RPC model into the generalizable
3DGS pipeline, enabling more effective use of sparse geometric cues for
improved reconstruction. SkySplat relies only on RGB images and
radiometric-robust relative height supervision, thereby eliminating the need
for ground-truth height maps. Key components include a Cross-Self Consistency
Module (CSCM), which mitigates transient object interference via
consistency-based masking, and a multi-view consistency aggregation strategy
that refines reconstruction results. Compared to per-scene optimization
methods, SkySplat achieves an 86 times speedup over EOGS with higher accuracy.
It also outperforms generalizable 3DGS baselines, reducing MAE from 13.18 m to
1.80 m on the DFC19 dataset significantly, and demonstrates strong
cross-dataset generalization on the MVS3D benchmark.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将长视频简化为静态关键帧匹配，忽略了时空关系和上下文连续性，导致关键帧冗余和信息稀释。

Method: Video-EM将关键帧建模为时序情景事件，结合空间关系和时序动态，并利用LLMs的链式思维迭代筛选最小但信息丰富的记忆子集。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，Video-EM性能提升4-9%，同时使用更少帧数。

Conclusion: Video-EM通过情景记忆建模和链式思维，显著提升了长视频理解的效率和准确性。

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) excel at general video understanding
but struggle with long-form videos due to context window limits. Consequently,
recent approaches focus on keyframe retrieval, condensing lengthy videos into a
small set of informative frames. Despite their practicality, these methods
simplify the problem to static text image matching, overlooking spatio temporal
relationships crucial for capturing scene transitions and contextual
continuity, and may yield redundant keyframes with limited information,
diluting salient cues essential for accurate video question answering. To
address these limitations, we introduce Video-EM, a training free framework
inspired by the principles of human episodic memory, designed to facilitate
robust and contextually grounded reasoning. Rather than treating keyframes as
isolated visual entities, Video-EM explicitly models them as temporally ordered
episodic events, capturing both spatial relationships and temporal dynamics
necessary for accurately reconstructing the underlying narrative. Furthermore,
the framework leverages chain of thought (CoT) thinking with LLMs to
iteratively identify a minimal yet highly informative subset of episodic
memories, enabling efficient and accurate question answering by Video-LLMs.
Extensive evaluations on the Video-MME, EgoSchema, HourVideo, and LVBench
benchmarks confirm the superiority of Video-EM, which achieves highly
competitive results with performance gains of 4-9 percent over respective
baselines while utilizing fewer frames.

Motivation: 扩散模型的快速发展引发了对潜在滥用的担忧，现有检测方法在面对未见生成模型时性能显著下降。

Method: 通过测量图像与其标题引导重建之间的语义差异（SARE），利用假图像与标题高度一致性的特性进行检测。

Result: 实验表明，SARE在GenImage和CommunityForensics等基准上表现优于现有方法，具有强泛化能力。

Conclusion: SARE是一种有效的跨模型假图像检测方法，能够应对多样化的生成模型。

Abstract: Recently, diffusion-generated image detection has gained increasing
attention, as the rapid advancement of diffusion models has raised serious
concerns about their potential misuse. While existing detection methods have
achieved promising results, their performance often degrades significantly when
facing fake images from unseen, out-of-distribution (OOD) generative models,
since they primarily rely on model-specific artifacts. To address this
limitation, we explore a fundamental property commonly observed in fake images.
Motivated by the observation that fake images tend to exhibit higher similarity
to their captions than real images, we propose a novel representation, namely
Semantic-Aware Reconstruction Error (SARE), that measures the semantic
difference between an image and its caption-guided reconstruction. The
hypothesis behind SARE is that real images, whose captions often fail to fully
capture their complex visual content, may undergo noticeable semantic shifts
during the caption-guided reconstruction process. In contrast, fake images,
which closely align with their captions, show minimal semantic changes. By
quantifying these semantic shifts, SARE can be utilized as a discriminative
feature for robust detection across diverse generative models. We empirically
demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits strong generalization,
outperforming existing baselines on benchmarks including GenImage and
CommunityForensics.

Conclusion: 该模型在手语生成中表现出色，为听障人士的沟通提供了更高效的工具。

Abstract: Sign language, which contains hand movements, facial expressions and bodily
gestures, is a significant medium for communicating with hard-of-hearing
people. A well-trained sign language community communicates easily, but those
who don't know sign language face significant challenges. Recognition and
generation are basic communication methods between hearing and hard-of-hearing
individuals. Despite progress in recognition, sign language generation still
needs to be explored. The Progressive Growing of Generative Adversarial Network
(ProGAN) excels at producing high-quality images, while the Self-Attention
Generative Adversarial Network (SAGAN) generates feature-rich images at medium
resolutions. Balancing resolution and detail is crucial for sign language image
generation. We are developing a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) variant
that combines both models to generate feature-rich, high-resolution, and
class-conditional sign language images. Our modified Attention-based model
generates high-quality images of Indian Sign Language letters, numbers, and
words, outperforming the traditional ProGAN in Inception Score (IS) and
Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID), with improvements of 3.2 and 30.12,
respectively. Additionally, we are publishing a large dataset incorporating

Motivation: 相似物体干扰（SOI）是单目标跟踪（SOT）中被长期忽视的关键瓶颈，本文旨在量化其影响并提出解决方案。

Method: 通过在线干扰掩蔽（OIM）实验量化SOI影响，构建SOIBench基准测试，并提出基于大规模视觉语言模型（VLM）的新方法。

Result: 消除干扰源显著提升跟踪性能（AUC增益达4.35），但现有视觉语言跟踪（VLT）方法效果有限（AUC变化-0.26至+0.71），而新方法在语义引导下表现优异（AUC增益达0.93）。

Conclusion: SOIBench可作为标准化评估平台，推动语义认知跟踪研究，并为跟踪领域提供新见解。

Abstract: In this paper, we present the first systematic investigation and
quantification of Similar Object Interference (SOI), a long-overlooked yet
critical bottleneck in Single Object Tracking (SOT). Through controlled Online
Interference Masking (OIM) experiments, we quantitatively demonstrate that
eliminating interference sources leads to substantial performance improvements
(AUC gains up to 4.35) across all SOTA trackers, directly validating SOI as a
primary constraint for robust tracking and highlighting the feasibility of
external cognitive guidance. Building upon these insights, we adopt natural
language as a practical form of external guidance, and construct SOIBench-the
first semantic cognitive guidance benchmark specifically targeting SOI
challenges. It automatically mines SOI frames through multi-tracker collective
judgment and introduces a multi-level annotation protocol to generate precise
semantic guidance texts. Systematic evaluation on SOIBench reveals a striking
finding: existing vision-language tracking (VLT) methods fail to effectively
exploit semantic cognitive guidance, achieving only marginal improvements or
even performance degradation (AUC changes of -0.26 to +0.71). In contrast, we
propose a novel paradigm employing large-scale vision-language models (VLM) as
external cognitive engines that can be seamlessly integrated into arbitrary RGB
trackers. This approach demonstrates substantial improvements under semantic
cognitive guidance (AUC gains up to 0.93), representing a significant
advancement over existing VLT methods. We hope SOIBench will serve as a
standardized evaluation platform to advance semantic cognitive tracking
research and contribute new insights to the tracking research community.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ViT的自注意力机制缺乏显式的空间归纳偏置，导致在空间结构任务中表现不佳。现有方法采用固定距离度量的空间衰减，无法适应多样化的视觉场景。

Method: 提出SDT，引入CAG机制，动态生成数据依赖的空间衰减，结合曼哈顿距离的空间先验和学习的内容表示。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K分类和生成任务中，SDT表现优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 数据依赖的空间衰减为视觉Transformer的空间注意力增强提供了新范式。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have revolutionized computer vision, yet their
self-attention mechanism lacks explicit spatial inductive biases, leading to
suboptimal performance on spatially-structured tasks. Existing approaches
introduce data-independent spatial decay based on fixed distance metrics,
applying uniform attention weighting regardless of image content and limiting
adaptability to diverse visual scenarios. Inspired by recent advances in large
language models where content-aware gating mechanisms (e.g., GLA, HGRN2, FOX)
significantly outperform static alternatives, we present the first successful
adaptation of data-dependent spatial decay to 2D vision transformers. We
introduce \textbf{Spatial Decay Transformer (SDT)}, featuring a novel
Context-Aware Gating (CAG) mechanism that generates dynamic, data-dependent
decay for patch interactions. Our approach learns to modulate spatial attention
based on both content relevance and spatial proximity. We address the
fundamental challenge of 1D-to-2D adaptation through a unified spatial-content
fusion framework that integrates manhattan distance-based spatial priors with
learned content representations. Extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K
classification and generation tasks demonstrate consistent improvements over
strong baselines. Our work establishes data-dependent spatial decay as a new
paradigm for enhancing spatial attention in vision transformers.

Conclusion: AKCS和MACA的结合有效解决了测量非相干性和表示学习问题，提升了压缩感知性能。

Abstract: Deep networks have achieved remarkable success in image compressed sensing
(CS) task, namely reconstructing a high-fidelity image from its compressed
measurement. However, existing works are deficient inincoherent compressed
measurement at sensing phase and implicit measurement representations at
reconstruction phase, limiting the overall performance. In this work, we answer
two questions: 1) how to improve the measurement incoherence for decreasing the
ill-posedness; 2) how to learn informative representations from measurements.
To this end, we propose a novel asymmetric Kronecker CS (AKCS) model and
theoretically present its better incoherence than previous Kronecker CS with
minimal complexity increase. Moreover, we reveal that the unfolding networks'
superiority over non-unfolding ones result from sufficient gradient descents,
called explicit measurement representations. We propose a measurement-aware
cross attention (MACA) mechanism to learn implicit measurement representations.
We integrate AKCS and MACA into widely-used unfolding architecture to get a
measurement-enhanced unfolding network (MEUNet). Extensive experiences
demonstrate that our MEUNet achieves state-of-the-art performance in
reconstruction accuracy and inference speed.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: COXNet提出了一种新的RGBT微小目标检测框架，通过跨层融合、动态对齐和标签优化策略，显著提升了检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在无人机场景中，RGBT图像中的微小目标检测面临空间错位、低光照和复杂背景等挑战，现有方法难以有效利用多模态互补信息。

Method: COXNet采用跨层融合模块、动态对齐与尺度细化模块，以及基于几何形状相似度的标签分配策略。

Result: 在RGBTDronePerson数据集上，COXNet的mAP50提升了3.32%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: COXNet在复杂环境中表现出鲁棒的检测能力，为解决RGBT微小目标检测问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Detecting tiny objects in multimodal Red-Green-Blue-Thermal (RGBT) imagery is
a critical challenge in computer vision, particularly in surveillance, search
and rescue, and autonomous navigation. Drone-based scenarios exacerbate these
challenges due to spatial misalignment, low-light conditions, occlusion, and
cluttered backgrounds. Current methods struggle to leverage the complementary
information between visible and thermal modalities effectively. We propose
COXNet, a novel framework for RGBT tiny object detection, addressing these
issues through three core innovations: i) the Cross-Layer Fusion Module, fusing
high-level visible and low-level thermal features for enhanced semantic and
spatial accuracy; ii) the Dynamic Alignment and Scale Refinement module,
correcting cross-modal spatial misalignments and preserving multi-scale
features; and iii) an optimized label assignment strategy using the GeoShape
Similarity Measure for better localization. COXNet achieves a 3.32\% mAP$_{50}$
improvement on the RGBTDronePerson dataset over state-of-the-art methods,
demonstrating its effectiveness for robust detection in complex environments.

### [60] [Iterative Volume Fusion for Asymmetric Stereo Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09543)
*Yuanting Gao,Linghao Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为IVF-AStereo的双阶段迭代体积融合网络，用于解决非对称立体视觉中的匹配问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统立体匹配算法假设双目视觉对称，但非对称多相机系统（如广角-长焦相机）的出现打破了这一假设，导致匹配困难。

Method: 通过分析两种成本体积构建方法的匹配成本分布，发现信息失真问题，提出结合两种体积的双阶段融合网络。

Result: 在非对称场景下表现出色，对分辨率和颜色退化具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 实验验证了该方法在非对称立体匹配中的有效性。

Abstract: Stereo matching is vital in 3D computer vision, with most algorithms assuming
symmetric visual properties between binocular visions. However, the rise of
asymmetric multi-camera systems (e.g., tele-wide cameras) challenges this
assumption and complicates stereo matching. Visual asymmetry disrupts stereo
matching by affecting the crucial cost volume computation. To address this, we
explore the matching cost distribution of two established cost volume
construction methods in asymmetric stereo. We find that each cost volume
experiences distinct information distortion, indicating that both should be
comprehensively utilized to solve the issue. Based on this, we propose the
two-phase Iterative Volume Fusion network for Asymmetric Stereo matching
(IVF-AStereo). Initially, the aggregated concatenation volume refines the
correlation volume. Subsequently, both volumes are fused to enhance fine
details. Our method excels in asymmetric scenarios and shows robust performance
against significant visual asymmetry. Extensive comparative experiments on
benchmark datasets, along with ablation studies, confirm the effectiveness of
our approach in asymmetric stereo with resolution and color degradation.

TL;DR: GoViG任务利用原始视觉数据生成导航指令，通过视觉预测和指令生成两个子任务，结合多模态大语言模型，显著提升适应性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖结构化输入（如语义标注或环境地图），限制了在未知和非结构化环境中的适应性。GoViG旨在仅通过视觉观察生成精确导航指令。

Method: 任务分解为视觉预测（预测中间状态）和指令生成（合成语言指令），结合多模态大语言模型和两种推理策略（单次和交替推理）。

Result: 在R2R-Goal数据集上表现优异，BLEU-4和CIDEr分数显著提升，并展示出强大的跨域泛化能力。

Conclusion: GoViG通过纯视觉输入生成高质量导航指令，为未知环境中的导航提供了新思路。

Abstract: We introduce Goal-Conditioned Visual Navigation Instruction Generation
(GoViG), a new task that aims to autonomously generate precise and contextually
coherent navigation instructions solely from egocentric visual observations of
initial and goal states. Unlike conventional approaches that rely on structured
inputs such as semantic annotations or environmental maps, GoViG exclusively
leverages raw egocentric visual data, substantially improving its adaptability
to unseen and unstructured environments. Our method addresses this task by
decomposing it into two interconnected subtasks: (1) visual forecasting, which
predicts intermediate visual states bridging the initial and goal views; and
(2) instruction generation, which synthesizes linguistically coherent
instructions grounded in both observed and anticipated visuals. These subtasks
are integrated within an autoregressive multimodal large language model trained
with tailored objectives to ensure spatial accuracy and linguistic clarity.
Furthermore, we introduce two complementary multimodal reasoning strategies,
one-pass and interleaved reasoning, to mimic incremental human cognitive
processes during navigation. To evaluate our method, we propose the R2R-Goal
dataset, combining diverse synthetic and real-world trajectories. Empirical
results demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods,
achieving superior BLEU-4 and CIDEr scores along with robust cross-domain
generalization.

Motivation: 解决机器学习中如何利用生成模型增强图像分类性能的问题，探索真实图像与合成图像在数据增强中的效果。

Method: 通过实验比较真实图像与合成图像在数据增强中的效果，量化合成数据的等效规模，并与开放集生成增强进行对比。

Conclusion: 研究提供了量化合成数据增强需求的指南，并展示了其在自然和医学图像数据集上的应用效果。

Abstract: In this paper, we address a key scientific problem in machine learning: Given
a training set for an image classification task, can we train a generative
model on this dataset to enhance the classification performance? (i.e.,
closed-set generative data augmentation). We start by exploring the
distinctions and similarities between real images and closed-set synthetic
images generated by advanced generative models. Through extensive experiments,
we offer systematic insights into the effective use of closed-set synthetic
data for augmentation. Notably, we empirically determine the equivalent scale
of synthetic images needed for augmentation. In addition, we also show
quantitative equivalence between the real data augmentation and open-set
generative augmentation (generative models trained using data beyond the given
training set). While it aligns with the common intuition that real images are
generally preferred, our empirical formulation also offers a guideline to
quantify the increased scale of synthetic data augmentation required to achieve
comparable image classification performance. Our results on natural and medical
image datasets further illustrate how this effect varies with the baseline
training set size and the amount of synthetic data incorporated.

Motivation: 探索一种紧凑、可解释且高效的虹膜识别方法，适用于数据有限或需要解释性的场景。

Method: 将虹膜图像分块，计算每块的Betti0、Betti1及其比值，形成特征矩阵，结合逻辑回归等分类器进行识别。

Result: 逻辑回归准确率达97.78%，优于CNN（96.44%）和其他特征模型，特征稳定性高。

Conclusion: 首次将数字同调理论用于虹膜识别，提供了一种高效、可解释的替代方案，适用于多领域应用。

Abstract: Objective - This study presents a biometric identification method based on
topological invariants from 2D iris images, representing iris texture via
formally defined digital homology and evaluating classification performance.
  Methods - Each normalized iris image (48x482 pixels) is divided into grids
(e.g., 6x54 or 3x27). For each subregion, we compute Betti0, Betti1, and their
ratio using a recent algorithm for homology groups in 2D digital images. The
resulting invariants form a feature matrix used with logistic regression, KNN,
and SVM (with PCA and 100 randomized repetitions). A convolutional neural
network (CNN) is trained on raw images for comparison.
  Results - Logistic regression achieved 97.78 +/- 0.82% accuracy,
outperforming CNN (96.44 +/- 1.32%) and other feature-based models. The
topological features showed high accuracy with low variance.
  Conclusion - This is the first use of topological invariants from formal
digital homology for iris recognition. The method offers a compact,
interpretable, and accurate alternative to deep learning, useful when
explainability or limited data is important. Beyond iris recognition, it can
apply to other biometrics, medical imaging, materials science, remote sensing,
and interpretable AI. It runs efficiently on CPU-only systems and produces
robust, explainable features valuable for security-critical domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多曝光校正方法在处理单曝光图像时难以应对光照、环境和天气等因素引起的类内变异性，导致曝光异常校正不准确。

Method: 设计了曝光一致性对齐模块（ECAM）和曝光恢复与细节重建模块（EDRM），利用小波变换的光-细节解耦特性进行序列处理。

Result: 在多个公开数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著优于现有算法，性能提升明显。

Conclusion: WEC-DG方法在复杂成像条件下具有更高的适应性和实用性，有效解决了曝光校正中的细节恢复和一致性对齐问题。

Abstract: Multi-exposure correction technology is essential for restoring images
affected by insufficient or excessive lighting, enhancing the visual experience
by improving brightness, contrast, and detail richness. However, current
multi-exposure correction methods often encounter challenges in addressing
intra-class variability caused by diverse lighting conditions, shooting
environments, and weather factors, particularly when processing images captured
at a single exposure level. To enhance the adaptability of these models under
complex imaging conditions, this paper proposes a Wavelet-based Exposure
Correction method with Degradation Guidance (WEC-DG). Specifically, we
introduce a degradation descriptor within the Exposure Consistency Alignment
Module (ECAM) at both ends of the processing pipeline to ensure exposure
consistency and achieve final alignment. This mechanism effectively addresses
miscorrected exposure anomalies caused by existing methods' failure to
recognize 'blurred' exposure degradation. Additionally, we investigate the
light-detail decoupling properties of the wavelet transform to design the
Exposure Restoration and Detail Reconstruction Module (EDRM), which processes
low-frequency information related to exposure enhancement before utilizing
high-frequency information as a prior guide for reconstructing spatial domain
details. This serial processing strategy guarantees precise light correction
and enhances detail recovery. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple
public datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing
algorithms, achieving significant performance improvements and validating its
effectiveness and practical applicability.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为诊断链（CoD）的框架，旨在解决放射学报告生成（RRG）中的临床效果不佳和生成文本缺乏可解释性的问题。通过生成问答对和利用大语言模型，CoD提高了报告的准确性和可解释性，并通过病灶定位模块进一步提升了放射科医生的工作效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有放射学报告生成模型在临床效果（尤其是病灶属性描述）和可解释性方面表现不佳，导致放射科医生难以信任生成结果。

Method: 提出诊断链（CoD）框架，通过生成诊断对话的问答对提取关键发现，并利用大语言模型生成准确报告。设计了诊断和病灶定位模块以增强可解释性，并提出全监督学习策略以高效利用标注数据。

Result: CoD在两个RRG基准测试中表现优于专家和通用模型，并在可解释性方面表现出色，能够准确将生成的句子与问答诊断和图像关联。

Conclusion: CoD框架显著提升了放射学报告生成的准确性和可解释性，为临床实践提供了更可靠的辅助工具。

Abstract: Despite the progress of radiology report generation (RRG), existing works
face two challenges: 1) The performances in clinical efficacy are
unsatisfactory, especially for lesion attributes description; 2) the generated
text lacks explainability, making it difficult for radiologists to trust the
results. To address the challenges, we focus on a trustworthy RRG model, which
not only generates accurate descriptions of abnormalities, but also provides
basis of its predictions. To this end, we propose a framework named chain of
diagnosis (CoD), which maintains a chain of diagnostic process for clinically
accurate and explainable RRG. It first generates question-answer (QA) pairs via
diagnostic conversation to extract key findings, then prompts a large language
model with QA diagnoses for accurate generation. To enhance explainability, a
diagnosis grounding module is designed to match QA diagnoses and generated
sentences, where the diagnoses act as a reference. Moreover, a lesion grounding
module is designed to locate abnormalities in the image, further improving the
working efficiency of radiologists. To facilitate label-efficient training, we
propose an omni-supervised learning strategy with clinical consistency to
leverage various types of annotations from different datasets. Our efforts lead
to 1) an omni-labeled RRG dataset with QA pairs and lesion boxes; 2) a
evaluation tool for assessing the accuracy of reports in describing lesion
location and severity; 3) extensive experiments to demonstrate the
effectiveness of CoD, where it outperforms both specialist and generalist
models consistently on two RRG benchmarks and shows promising explainability by
accurately grounding generated sentences to QA diagnoses and images.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的双递归反馈（DRF）系统，用于改进可控文本到图像（T2I）扩散模型的空间和外观控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可控T2I模型在保留空间结构和捕捉细粒度条件（如物体姿态和场景布局）方面表现不佳。

Method: 通过外观反馈和生成反馈的双递归机制，优化中间潜在表示，以更好地反映外观信息和用户意图。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能生成高质量、语义一致且结构一致的图像，支持类不变的结构-外观融合。

Conclusion: DRF系统有效提升了可控T2I模型的性能，无需额外训练，代码已开源。

Abstract: Recent advancements in controllable text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models,
such as Ctrl-X and FreeControl, have demonstrated robust spatial and appearance
control without requiring auxiliary module training. However, these models
often struggle to accurately preserve spatial structures and fail to capture
fine-grained conditions related to object poses and scene layouts. To address
these challenges, we propose a training-free Dual Recursive Feedback (DRF)
system that properly reflects control conditions in controllable T2I models.
The proposed DRF consists of appearance feedback and generation feedback that
recursively refines the intermediate latents to better reflect the given
appearance information and the user's intent. This dual-update mechanism guides
latent representations toward reliable manifolds, effectively integrating
structural and appearance attributes. Our approach enables fine-grained
generation even between class-invariant structure-appearance fusion, such as
transferring human motion onto a tiger's form. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the efficacy of our method in producing high-quality, semantically
coherent, and structurally consistent image generations. Our source code is
available at https://github.com/jwonkm/DRF.

Motivation: 现有研究对LVLMs的幻觉评估不够细粒度，且依赖人工或公共数据集，缺乏可扩展性和可控性。

Method: 提出自动化数据构建流程和分层幻觉诱导框架，生成多样化评估数据并模拟噪声场景。

Result: SHALE包含30K+图像-指令对，覆盖12个视觉感知方面和6个知识领域，实验显示主流LVLMs存在显著事实性幻觉和对语义扰动的高敏感性。

Conclusion: SHALE为LVLMs的幻觉问题提供了可扩展、可控的评估工具，揭示了模型在噪声环境下的脆弱性。

Abstract: Despite rapid advances, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) still suffer
from hallucinations, i.e., generating content inconsistent with input or
established world knowledge, which correspond to faithfulness and factuality
hallucinations, respectively. Prior studies primarily evaluate faithfulness
hallucination at a coarse level (e.g., object-level) and lack fine-grained
analysis. Additionally, existing benchmarks rely on costly manual curation or
reused public datasets, raising concerns about scalability and data leakage. To
address these limitations, we propose an automated data construction pipeline
that produces scalable, controllable, and diverse evaluation data. We also
design a hierarchical hallucination induction framework with input
perturbations to simulate realistic noisy scenarios. Integrating these designs,
we construct SHALE, a Scalable HALlucination Evaluation benchmark designed to
assess both faithfulness and factuality hallucinations via a fine-grained
hallucination categorization scheme. SHALE comprises over 30K image-instruction
pairs spanning 12 representative visual perception aspects for faithfulness and
6 knowledge domains for factuality, considering both clean and noisy scenarios.
Extensive experiments on over 20 mainstream LVLMs reveal significant factuality
hallucinations and high sensitivity to semantic perturbations.

along with shape estimation to provide annotation labels on the detection level

evaluation of tracking performance and label annotation. If manually labeled
data is available, each processing module can be analyzed independently or
combined with other modules to enable closed-loop continuous improvements. The
framework performance is evaluated in a challenging urban real-world scenario
in terms of tracking performance and the label annotation errors. We
demonstrate the functionality of the proposed approach for varying dynamic

Conclusion: Hi-SMGNN为IDH突变预测提供了更有效的非侵入性解决方案，增强了个体特异性和可解释性。

Abstract: Isocitrate DeHydrogenase (IDH) mutation status is a crucial biomarker for
glioma prognosis. However, current prediction methods are limited by the low
availability and noise of functional MRI. Structural and morphological
connectomes offer a non-invasive alternative, yet existing approaches often
ignore the brain's hierarchical organisation and multiscale interactions. To
address this, we propose Hi-SMGNN, a hierarchical framework that integrates
structural and morphological connectomes from regional to modular levels. It
features a multimodal interaction module with a Siamese network and cross-modal
attention, a multiscale feature fusion mechanism for reducing redundancy, and a
personalised modular partitioning strategy to enhance individual specificity
and interpretability. Experiments on the UCSF-PDGM dataset demonstrate that
Hi-SMGNN outperforms baseline and state-of-the-art models, showing improved
robustness and effectiveness in IDH mutation prediction.

Result: 在NeRSemble数据集上实现了高保真渲染，并首次支持高斯头像的显式纹理图像和实时编辑。

Conclusion: SVG-Head为头像建模提供了高保真和实时编辑的新方法，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Creating high-fidelity and editable head avatars is a pivotal challenge in
computer vision and graphics, boosting many AR/VR applications. While recent
advancements have achieved photorealistic renderings and plausible animation,
head editing, especially real-time appearance editing, remains challenging due
to the implicit representation and entangled modeling of the geometry and
global appearance. To address this, we propose Surface-Volumetric Gaussian Head
Avatar (SVG-Head), a novel hybrid representation that explicitly models the
geometry with 3D Gaussians bound on a FLAME mesh and leverages disentangled
texture images to capture the global appearance. Technically, it contains two
types of Gaussians, in which surface Gaussians explicitly model the appearance
of head avatars using learnable texture images, facilitating real-time texture
editing, while volumetric Gaussians enhance the reconstruction quality of
non-Lambertian regions (e.g., lips and hair). To model the correspondence
between 3D world and texture space, we provide a mesh-aware Gaussian UV mapping
method, which leverages UV coordinates given by the FLAME mesh to obtain sharp
texture images and real-time rendering speed. A hierarchical optimization
strategy is further designed to pursue the optimal performance in both
reconstruction quality and editing flexibility. Experiments on the NeRSemble
dataset show that SVG-Head not only generates high-fidelity rendering results,
but also is the first method to obtain explicit texture images for Gaussian
head avatars and support real-time appearance editing.

TL;DR: FaME是一种无需训练且高效的方法，通过图像质量评估模型识别低质量生成样本，并利用这些失败模式作为负向引导，提升生成图像的感知质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在类到图像生成中表现优异，但某些类别生成的图像存在扭曲或低质量问题。FID指标仅评估全局分布对齐，忽略单个样本的感知质量。CFG技术虽能提升指标，但会引入分布偏移和视觉伪影。

Method: 提出FaME方法，利用图像质量评估模型识别低质量生成样本，存储其采样轨迹，并将这些失败模式作为负向引导，避免未来采样进入低质量区域。

Result: 在ImageNet上的实验表明，FaME在不影响FID的情况下，显著提升了视觉质量。

Conclusion: FaME是一种有效的训练无关方法，可提升扩散模型的感知质量，并有望扩展到文本到图像生成任务。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress in class-to-image
generation. However, we observe that despite impressive FID scores,
state-of-the-art models often generate distorted or low-quality images,
especially in certain classes. This gap arises because FID evaluates global
distribution alignment, while ignoring the perceptual quality of individual
samples. We further examine the role of CFG, a common technique used to enhance
generation quality. While effective in improving metrics and suppressing
outliers, CFG can introduce distribution shift and visual artifacts due to its
misalignment with both training objectives and user expectations. In this work,
we propose FaME, a training-free and inference-efficient method for improving
perceptual quality. FaME uses an image quality assessment model to identify
low-quality generations and stores their sampling trajectories. These failure
modes are then used as negative guidance to steer future sampling away from
poor-quality regions. Experiments on ImageNet demonstrate that FaME brings
consistent improvements in visual quality without compromising FID. FaME also
shows the potential to be extended to improve text-to-image generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 纯相机方法在BEV分割任务中性能落后于LiDAR-Camera融合方法，现有知识蒸馏方法因模仿教师模型架构导致推理成本增加。

Method: 引入轻量级教师助理网络，结合教师和学生的BEV表示，构建共享潜在空间，并通过Young不等式推导蒸馏损失。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上，性能提升4.2% mIoU，优于其他先进蒸馏方法45%。

Conclusion: BridgeTA框架有效提升纯相机模型性能，且不增加推理成本。

Abstract: Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) map segmentation is one of the most important and
challenging tasks in autonomous driving. Camera-only approaches have drawn
attention as cost-effective alternatives to LiDAR, but they still fall behind
LiDAR-Camera (LC) fusion-based methods. Knowledge Distillation (KD) has been
explored to narrow this gap, but existing methods mainly enlarge the student
model by mimicking the teacher's architecture, leading to higher inference
cost. To address this issue, we introduce BridgeTA, a cost-effective
distillation framework to bridge the representation gap between LC fusion and
Camera-only models through a Teacher Assistant (TA) network while keeping the
student's architecture and inference cost unchanged. A lightweight TA network
combines the BEV representations of the teacher and student, creating a shared
latent space that serves as an intermediate representation. To ground the
framework theoretically, we derive a distillation loss using Young's
Inequality, which decomposes the direct teacher-student distillation path into
teacher-TA and TA-student dual paths, stabilizing optimization and
strengthening knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments on the challenging
nuScenes dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving an
improvement of 4.2% mIoU over the Camera-only baseline, up to 45% higher than

TL;DR: MInDI-3D是首个基于3D条件扩散模型的稀疏视图CBCT伪影去除方法，可显著降低辐射剂量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减少医学成像中的辐射暴露，提升稀疏视图CBCT图像质量。

Method: 将2D InDI扩展到3D，通过迭代去噪直接从稀疏输入优化CBCT体积，并利用伪CBCT数据集训练模型。

Result: 在CT-RATE测试集上PSNR提升12.96 dB，辐射剂量降低8倍，且性能与3D U-Net相当。

Conclusion: MInDI-3D在临床评估中表现优异，适用于多种解剖部位，并能泛化到新CBCT扫描仪。

Abstract: We present MInDI-3D (Medical Inversion by Direct Iteration in 3D), the first
3D conditional diffusion-based model for real-world sparse-view Cone Beam
Computed Tomography (CBCT) artefact removal, aiming to reduce imaging radiation
exposure. A key contribution is extending the "InDI" concept from 2D to a full
3D volumetric approach for medical images, implementing an iterative denoising
process that refines the CBCT volume directly from sparse-view input. A further
contribution is the generation of a large pseudo-CBCT dataset (16,182) from
chest CT volumes of the CT-RATE public dataset to robustly train MInDI-3D. We
performed a comprehensive evaluation, including quantitative metrics,
scalability analysis, generalisation tests, and a clinical assessment by 11
clinicians. Our results show MInDI-3D's effectiveness, achieving a 12.96 (6.10)
dB PSNR gain over uncorrected scans with only 50 projections on the CT-RATE
pseudo-CBCT (independent real-world) test set and enabling an 8x reduction in
imaging radiation exposure. We demonstrate its scalability by showing that
performance improves with more training data. Importantly, MInDI-3D matches the
performance of a 3D U-Net on real-world scans from 16 cancer patients across
distortion and task-based metrics. It also generalises to new CBCT scanner
geometries. Clinicians rated our model as sufficient for patient positioning
across all anatomical sites and found it preserved lung tumour boundaries well.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SAD-Splat的3D-AVS-SS方法，通过高斯点丢弃模块和高置信度伪标签生成管道，解决了语义模糊问题，并在新数据集3D-AS上验证了其高效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在3D-AVS-SS任务中难以处理尺度变化和结构遮挡导致的语义模糊，限制了分割精度和一致性。

Method: 引入高斯点丢弃模块（基于Hard Concrete分布）和高置信度伪标签生成管道，结合2D基础模型增强监督。

Result: SAD-Splat在分割精度和表示紧凑性之间取得了优秀平衡，并在3D-AS数据集上验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: SAD-Splat为3D空中场景理解提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: In the task of 3D Aerial-view Scene Semantic Segmentation (3D-AVS-SS),
traditional methods struggle to address semantic ambiguity caused by scale
variations and structural occlusions in aerial images. This limits their
segmentation accuracy and consistency. To tackle these challenges, we propose a
novel 3D-AVS-SS approach named SAD-Splat. Our method introduces a Gaussian
point drop module, which integrates semantic confidence estimation with a
learnable sparsity mechanism based on the Hard Concrete distribution. This
module effectively eliminates redundant and semantically ambiguous Gaussian
points, enhancing both segmentation performance and representation compactness.
Furthermore, SAD-Splat incorporates a high-confidence pseudo-label generation
pipeline. It leverages 2D foundation models to enhance supervision when
ground-truth labels are limited, thereby further improving segmentation
accuracy. To advance research in this domain, we introduce a challenging
benchmark dataset: 3D Aerial Semantic (3D-AS), which encompasses diverse
real-world aerial scenes with sparse annotations. Experimental results
demonstrate that SAD-Splat achieves an excellent balance between segmentation
accuracy and representation compactness. It offers an efficient and scalable
solution for 3D aerial scene understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有高性能模型在手部几何与图像外观的对齐上仍不完美，纹理对齐可能是一个未被充分利用的监督信号。

Method: 提出一个轻量级纹理模块，将像素观测嵌入UV纹理空间，并设计了一种密集对齐损失函数。

Result: 通过纹理引导的监督，系统在手部重建的准确性和真实感上均有所提升。

Conclusion: 纹理对齐在3D手部重建中具有重要价值，且该方法易于集成到现有流程中。

Abstract: We revisit the role of texture in monocular 3D hand reconstruction, not as an
afterthought for photorealism, but as a dense, spatially grounded cue that can
actively support pose and shape estimation. Our observation is simple: even in
high-performing models, the overlay between predicted hand geometry and image
appearance is often imperfect, suggesting that texture alignment may be an
underused supervisory signal. We propose a lightweight texture module that
embeds per-pixel observations into UV texture space and enables a novel dense
alignment loss between predicted and observed hand appearances. Our approach
assumes access to a differentiable rendering pipeline and a model that maps
images to 3D hand meshes with known topology, allowing us to back-project a
textured hand onto the image and perform pixel-based alignment. The module is
self-contained and easily pluggable into existing reconstruction pipelines. To
isolate and highlight the value of texture-guided supervision, we augment
HaMeR, a high-performing yet unadorned transformer architecture for 3D hand
pose estimation. The resulting system improves both accuracy and realism,
demonstrating the value of appearance-guided alignment in hand reconstruction.

Abstract: The paper-to-video task converts a research paper into a structured video
abstract, distilling key concepts, methods, and conclusions into an accessible,

demonstrate potential, they are constrained by limited context windows, rigid
video duration constraints, limited stylistic diversity, and an inability to
represent domain-specific knowledge. To address these limitations, we introduce
Preacher, the first paper-to-video agentic system. Preacher employs a top-down
approach to decompose, summarize, and reformulate the paper, followed by
bottom-up video generation, synthesizing diverse video segments into a coherent
abstract. To align cross-modal representations, we define key scenes and
introduce a Progressive Chain of Thought (P-CoT) for granular, iterative
planning. Preacher successfully generates high-quality video abstracts across
five research fields, demonstrating expertise beyond current video generation
models. Code will be released at: https://github.com/GenVerse/Paper2Video

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超声图像的低对比度和模糊纹理细节限制了胎儿躯干平面的精细识别，影响产前诊断的可靠性。

Method: 设计了MCFM模块，通过在不同对比条件下分配注意力权重，增强特征提取能力，同时保持参数开销最小。

Result: 在胎儿躯干平面超声图像数据集上，MCFM显著提高了识别性能，且模型复杂度增加极小。

Conclusion: MCFM通过多对比融合增强特征表示，为产前筛查提供了更准确和一致的诊断支持，具有临床推广潜力。

Abstract: Purpose: Prenatal ultrasound is a key tool in evaluating fetal structural
development and detecting abnormalities, contributing to reduced perinatal
complications and improved neonatal survival. Accurate identification of
standard fetal torso planes is essential for reliable assessment and
personalized prenatal care. However, limitations such as low contrast and
unclear texture details in ultrasound imaging pose significant challenges for
fine-grained anatomical recognition. Methods: We propose a novel Multi-Contrast
Fusion Module (MCFM) to enhance the model's ability to extract detailed
information from ultrasound images. MCFM operates exclusively on the lower
layers of the neural network, directly processing raw ultrasound data. By
assigning attention weights to image representations under different contrast
conditions, the module enhances feature modeling while explicitly maintaining
minimal parameter overhead. Results: The proposed MCFM was evaluated on a
curated dataset of fetal torso plane ultrasound images. Experimental results
demonstrate that MCFM substantially improves recognition performance, with a
minimal increase in model complexity. The integration of multi-contrast
attention enables the model to better capture subtle anatomical structures,
contributing to higher classification accuracy and clinical reliability.
Conclusions: Our method provides an effective solution for improving fetal
torso plane recognition in ultrasound imaging. By enhancing feature
representation through multi-contrast fusion, the proposed approach supports
clinicians in achieving more accurate and consistent diagnoses, demonstrating
strong potential for clinical adoption in prenatal screening. The codes are

Motivation: 由于腮腺病变大小不一且边界复杂，现有方法依赖精确提示或忽略专家知识，PG-SAM旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 结合专家诊断报告生成提示信息，并通过跨序列注意力模块整合多模态信息，最终输入解码器进行分割。

Result: 在三个独立临床中心验证中，PG-SAM表现最优，证实了其临床适用性和专家文本的有效性。

Conclusion: PG-SAM通过融合专家知识和多模态信息，显著提升了腮腺病变分割的准确性和实用性。

Abstract: Parotid gland lesion segmentation is essential for the treatment of parotid
gland diseases. However, due to the variable size and complex lesion
boundaries, accurate parotid gland lesion segmentation remains challenging.
Recently, the Segment Anything Model (SAM) fine-tuning has shown remarkable
performance in the field of medical image segmentation. Nevertheless, SAM's
interaction segmentation model relies heavily on precise lesion prompts
(points, boxes, masks, etc.), which are very difficult to obtain in real-world
applications. Besides, current medical image segmentation methods are
automatically generated, ignoring the domain knowledge of medical experts when
performing segmentation. To address these limitations, we propose the parotid
gland segment anything model (PG-SAM), an expert diagnosis text-guided SAM
incorporating expert domain knowledge for cross-sequence parotid gland lesion
segmentation. Specifically, we first propose an expert diagnosis report guided
prompt generation module that can automatically generate prompt information
containing the prior domain knowledge to guide the subsequent lesion
segmentation process. Then, we introduce a cross-sequence attention module,
which integrates the complementary information of different modalities to
enhance the segmentation effect. Finally, the multi-sequence image features and
generated prompts are feed into the decoder to get segmentation result.
Experimental results demonstrate that PG-SAM achieves state-of-the-art
performance in parotid gland lesion segmentation across three independent
clinical centers, validating its clinical applicability and the effectiveness
of diagnostic text for enhancing image segmentation in real-world clinical
settings.

Result: 评估指标包括目标配准误差（TRE）、最坏情况标志错位鲁棒性（TRE30）和运行时间。

Conclusion: ReMIND2Reg通过标准化评估框架，促进开发稳健、通用且临床可部署的多模态配准算法。

Abstract: Accurate intraoperative image guidance is critical for achieving maximal safe
resection in brain tumor surgery, yet neuronavigation systems based on
preoperative MRI lose accuracy during the procedure due to brain shift.
Aligning post-resection intraoperative ultrasound (iUS) with preoperative MRI
can restore spatial accuracy by estimating brain shift deformations, but it
remains a challenging problem given the large anatomical and topological
changes and substantial modality intensity gap. The ReMIND2Reg 2025 Challenge
provides the largest public benchmark for this task, built upon the ReMIND
dataset. It offers 99 training cases, 5 validation cases, and 10 private test
cases comprising paired 3D ceT1 MRI, T2 MRI, and post-resection 3D iUS volumes.
Data are provided without annotations for training, while validation and test
performance are evaluated on manually annotated anatomical landmarks. Metrics
include target registration error (TRE), robustness to worst-case landmark
misalignment (TRE30), and runtime. By establishing a standardized evaluation
framework for this clinically critical and technically complex problem,
ReMIND2Reg aims to accelerate the development of robust, generalizable, and
clinically deployable multimodal registration algorithms for image-guided
neurosurgery.

Result: 在仿真和真实数据集上验证了方法的有效性，尤其在快速扫描和稀疏照明点数据中表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法为复杂场景下的NLOS成像提供了可行解决方案，兼具高精度、鲁棒性和动态适应性。

Abstract: Computational imaging, especially non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging, the
extraction of information from obscured or hidden scenes is achieved through
the utilization of indirect light signals resulting from multiple reflections
or scattering. The inherently weak nature of these signals, coupled with their
susceptibility to noise, necessitates the integration of physical processes to
ensure accurate reconstruction. This paper presents a parameterized inverse
problem framework tailored for large-scale linear problems in 3D imaging
reconstruction. Initially, a noise estimation module is employed to adaptively
assess the noise levels present in transient data. Subsequently, a
parameterized neural operator is developed to approximate the inverse mapping,
facilitating end-to-end rapid image reconstruction. Our 3D image reconstruction
framework, grounded in operator learning, is constructed through deep algorithm
unfolding, which not only provides commendable model interpretability but also
enables dynamic adaptation to varying noise levels in the acquired data,
thereby ensuring consistently robust and accurate reconstruction outcomes.
Furthermore, we introduce a novel method for the fusion of global and local
spatiotemporal data features. By integrating structural and detailed
information, this method significantly enhances both accuracy and robustness.
Comprehensive numerical experiments conducted on both simulated and real
datasets substantiate the efficacy of the proposed method. It demonstrates
remarkable performance with fast scanning data and sparse illumination point
data, offering a viable solution for NLOS imaging in complex scenarios.

Method: 提出NegFaceDiff方法，利用负条件在扩散过程中显式引导模型远离不需要的特征，同时保持类内一致性。

Result: 实验表明，NegFaceDiff显著提升了生成数据的身份一致性和可分离性（FDR从2.427提升至5.687），并在多个基准测试中优于无负条件生成的数据训练的模型。

Conclusion: NegFaceDiff通过负条件采样有效解决了身份重叠问题，为人脸识别模型的训练提供了更优质的合成数据。

Abstract: The use of synthetic data as an alternative to authentic datasets in face
recognition (FR) development has gained significant attention, addressing
privacy, ethical, and practical concerns associated with collecting and using
authentic data. Recent state-of-the-art approaches have proposed
identity-conditioned diffusion models to generate identity-consistent face
images, facilitating their use in training FR models. However, these methods
often lack explicit sampling mechanisms to enforce inter-class separability,
leading to identity overlap in the generated data and, consequently, suboptimal
FR performance. In this work, we introduce NegFaceDiff, a novel sampling method
that incorporates negative conditions into the identity-conditioned diffusion
process. NegFaceDiff enhances identity separation by leveraging negative
conditions that explicitly guide the model away from unwanted features while
preserving intra-class consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
NegFaceDiff significantly improves the identity consistency and separability of
data generated by identity-conditioned diffusion models. Specifically, identity
separability, measured by the Fisher Discriminant Ratio (FDR), increases from
2.427 to 5.687. These improvements are reflected in FR systems trained on the
NegFaceDiff dataset, which outperform models trained on data generated without
negative conditions across multiple benchmarks.

Method: 基于DiT的视频扩散模型，结合2D语义和3D几何特征，利用参考视图修复伪影。

Result: GSFixer在3DGS伪影修复和稀疏视图3D重建中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GSFixer通过多特征整合和基准数据集DL3DV-Res，显著提升了3DGS重建质量。

Abstract: Reconstructing 3D scenes using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) from sparse views
is an ill-posed problem due to insufficient information, often resulting in
noticeable artifacts. While recent approaches have sought to leverage
generative priors to complete information for under-constrained regions, they
struggle to generate content that remains consistent with input observations.
To address this challenge, we propose GSFixer, a novel framework designed to
improve the quality of 3DGS representations reconstructed from sparse inputs.
The core of our approach is the reference-guided video restoration model, built
upon a DiT-based video diffusion model trained on paired artifact 3DGS renders
and clean frames with additional reference-based conditions. Considering the
input sparse views as references, our model integrates both 2D semantic
features and 3D geometric features of reference views extracted from the visual
geometry foundation model, enhancing the semantic coherence and 3D consistency
when fixing artifact novel views. Furthermore, considering the lack of suitable
benchmarks for 3DGS artifact restoration evaluation, we present DL3DV-Res which
contains artifact frames rendered using low-quality 3DGS. Extensive experiments
demonstrate our GSFixer outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in 3DGS
artifact restoration and sparse-view 3D reconstruction. Project page:

Conclusion: PaCo-FR推动了面部表示学习，提供了一种可扩展且高效的解决方案，减少了对昂贵标注数据的依赖。

Abstract: Facial representation pre-training is crucial for tasks like facial
recognition, expression analysis, and virtual reality. However, existing
methods face three key challenges: (1) failing to capture distinct facial
features and fine-grained semantics, (2) ignoring the spatial structure
inherent to facial anatomy, and (3) inefficiently utilizing limited labeled
data. To overcome these, we introduce PaCo-FR, an unsupervised framework that
combines masked image modeling with patch-pixel alignment. Our approach
integrates three innovative components: (1) a structured masking strategy that
preserves spatial coherence by aligning with semantically meaningful facial
regions, (2) a novel patch-based codebook that enhances feature discrimination
with multiple candidate tokens, and (3) spatial consistency constraints that
preserve geometric relationships between facial components. PaCo-FR achieves
state-of-the-art performance across several facial analysis tasks with just 2
million unlabeled images for pre-training. Our method demonstrates significant
improvements, particularly in scenarios with varying poses, occlusions, and
lighting conditions. We believe this work advances facial representation
learning and offers a scalable, efficient solution that reduces reliance on
expensive annotated datasets, driving more effective facial analysis systems.

Conclusion: SAFF通过有效过滤无关特征，显著提升了小样本分类性能。

Abstract: Irrelevant features can significantly degrade few-shot learn ing performance.
This problem is used to match queries and support images based on meaningful
similarities despite the limited data. However, in this process, non-relevant
fea tures such as background elements can easily lead to confu sion and
misclassification. To address this issue, we pro pose Slot Attention-based
Feature Filtering for Few-Shot Learning (SAFF) that leverages slot attention
mechanisms to discriminate and filter weak features, thereby improving few-shot
classification performance. The key innovation of SAFF lies in its integration
of slot attention with patch em beddings, unifying class-aware slots into a
single attention mechanism to filter irrelevant features effectively. We intro
duce a similarity matrix that computes across support and query images to
quantify the relevance of filtered embed dings for classification. Through
experiments, we demon strate that Slot Attention performs better than other
atten tion mechanisms, capturing discriminative features while reducing
irrelevant information. We validate our approach through extensive experiments
on few-shot learning bench marks: CIFAR-FS, FC100, miniImageNet and tieredIma

Result: 在两个基准数据集上显著优于现有方法，定性和定量评估均表现优异。

Conclusion: MangaDiT通过内部注意力机制有效提升参考引导线稿上色的区域级颜色一致性。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have significantly improved the
performance of reference-guided line art colorization. However, existing
methods still struggle with region-level color consistency, especially when the
reference and target images differ in character pose or motion. Instead of
relying on external matching annotations between the reference and target, we
propose to discover semantic correspondences implicitly through internal
attention mechanisms. In this paper, we present MangaDiT, a powerful model for
reference-guided line art colorization based on Diffusion Transformers (DiT).
Our model takes both line art and reference images as conditional inputs and
introduces a hierarchical attention mechanism with a dynamic attention
weighting strategy. This mechanism augments the vanilla attention with an
additional context-aware path that leverages pooled spatial features,
effectively expanding the model's receptive field and enhancing region-level
color alignment. Experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving
superior performance in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

Result: 在肺炎检测任务中，NEURAL将图像数据大小减少93.4-97.7%，同时保持0.88-0.95 AUC的高诊断性能。

Conclusion: NEURAL通过创建任务无关的数据资产，解决了数据大小与临床效用之间的权衡，支持高效工作流程和远程放射学。

Abstract: The rapid growth of multimodal medical imaging data presents significant
storage and transmission challenges, particularly in resource-constrained
clinical settings. We propose NEURAL, a novel framework that addresses this by
using semantics-guided data compression. Our approach repurposes
cross-attention scores between the image and its radiological report from a
fine-tuned generative vision-language model to structurally prune chest X-rays,
preserving only diagnostically critical regions. This process transforms the
image into a highly compressed, graph representation. This unified graph-based
representation fuses the pruned visual graph with a knowledge graph derived
from the clinical report, creating a universal data structure that simplifies
downstream modeling. Validated on the MIMIC-CXR and CheXpert Plus dataset for
pneumonia detection, NEURAL achieves a 93.4-97.7\% reduction in image data size
while maintaining a high diagnostic performance of 0.88-0.95 AUC, outperforming
other baseline models that use uncompressed data. By creating a persistent,
task-agnostic data asset, NEURAL resolves the trade-off between data size and
clinical utility, enabling efficient workflows and teleradiology without
sacrificing performance. Our NEURAL code is available at

Abstract: Glioblastoma is a highly invasive brain tumor with rapid progression rates.
Recent studies have shown that glioblastoma molecular subtype classification
serves as a significant biomarker for effective targeted therapy selection.
However, this classification currently requires invasive tissue extraction for
comprehensive histopathological analysis. Existing multimodal approaches
combining MRI and histopathology images are limited and lack robust mechanisms
for preserving shared structural information across modalities. In particular,
graph-based models often fail to retain discriminative features within
heterogeneous graphs, and structural reconstruction mechanisms for handling
missing or incomplete modality data are largely underexplored. To address these
limitations, we propose a novel sheaf-based framework for structure-aware and
consistent fusion of MRI and histopathology data. Our model outperforms
baseline methods and demonstrates robustness in incomplete or missing data
scenarios, contributing to the development of virtual biopsy tools for rapid
diagnostics. Our source code is available at

Motivation: 研究旨在开发一种具备人类类似长期记忆的多模态代理，以提升其在复杂任务中的理解和推理能力。

Method: M3-Agent采用实体中心的多模态记忆格式，结合强化学习训练，并通过M3-Bench基准测试评估其性能。

Result: M3-Agent在M3-Bench-robot、M3-Bench-web和VideoMME-long基准测试中分别比基线模型高出6.7%、7.7%和5.3%的准确率。

Conclusion: M3-Agent在多模态代理的长期记忆和推理能力方面取得了显著进展，为实际应用提供了新的设计思路。

Abstract: We introduce M3-Agent, a novel multimodal agent framework equipped with
long-term memory. Like humans, M3-Agent can process real-time visual and
auditory inputs to build and update its long-term memory. Beyond episodic
memory, it also develops semantic memory, enabling it to accumulate world
knowledge over time. Its memory is organized in an entity-centric, multimodal
format, allowing deeper and more consistent understanding of the environment.
Given an instruction, M3-Agent autonomously performs multi-turn, iterative
reasoning and retrieves relevant information from memory to accomplish the
task. To evaluate memory effectiveness and memory-based reasoning in multimodal
agents, we develop M3-Bench, a new long-video question answering benchmark.
M3-Bench comprises 100 newly recorded real-world videos captured from a robot's
perspective (M3-Bench-robot) and 929 web-sourced videos across diverse
scenarios (M3-Bench-web). We annotate question-answer pairs designed to test
key capabilities essential for agent applications, such as human understanding,
general knowledge extraction, and cross-modal reasoning. Experimental results
show that M3-Agent, trained via reinforcement learning, outperforms the
strongest baseline, a prompting agent using Gemini-1.5-pro and GPT-4o,
achieving 6.7%, 7.7%, and 5.3% higher accuracy on M3-Bench-robot, M3-Bench-web
and VideoMME-long, respectively. Our work advances the multimodal agents toward
more human-like long-term memory and provides insights into their practical
design. Model, code and data are available at

Motivation: 现有基于LDM的协调方法在细节保留和协调能力上存在不足，且合成数据集缺乏真实光照变化。

Method: 提出R2R模型，结合Clear-VAE和MACA机制，动态调整前景；使用Random Poisson Blending生成多样化合成数据。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在定量指标和视觉协调性上优于其他方法，且新数据集提升了模型在真实场景中的表现。

Conclusion: R2R方法显著提升了图像协调效果，公开的代码和数据集为后续研究提供了便利。

Abstract: The goal of image harmonization is to adjust the foreground in a composite
image to achieve visual consistency with the background. Recently, latent
diffusion model (LDM) are applied for harmonization, achieving remarkable
results. However, LDM-based harmonization faces challenges in detail
preservation and limited harmonization ability. Additionally, current synthetic
datasets rely on color transfer, which lacks local variations and fails to
capture complex real-world lighting conditions. To enhance harmonization
capabilities, we propose the Region-to-Region transformation. By injecting
information from appropriate regions into the foreground, this approach
preserves original details while achieving image harmonization or, conversely,
generating new composite data. From this perspective, We propose a novel model
R2R. Specifically, we design Clear-VAE to preserve high-frequency details in
the foreground using Adaptive Filter while eliminating disharmonious elements.
To further enhance harmonization, we introduce the Harmony Controller with
Mask-aware Adaptive Channel Attention (MACA), which dynamically adjusts the
foreground based on the channel importance of both foreground and background
regions. To address the limitation of existing datasets, we propose Random
Poisson Blending, which transfers color and lighting information from a
suitable region to the foreground, thereby generating more diverse and
challenging synthetic images. Using this method, we construct a new synthetic
dataset, RPHarmony. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over
other methods in both quantitative metrics and visual harmony. Moreover, our
dataset helps the model generate more realistic images in real examples. Our
code, dataset, and model weights have all been released for open access.

Conclusion: MoIIE是一种高效且通用的方法，适用于多模态任务，显著提升了参数效率和性能。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance
across multi-modal tasks by scaling model size and training data. However,
these dense LVLMs incur significant computational costs and motivate the
exploration of sparse Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures. While MoE improve
parameter efficiency, effectively applying MoE to simultaneously model
modality-specific features and cross-modal associations in LVLMs remains
challenging. In this work, we propose to incorporate Mixture of Intra- and
Inter-Modality Experts (MoIIE) to LVLMs. For each token, expert routing is
guided by its modality, directing tokens to their respective intra-modality
experts as well as a shared pool of inter-modality experts, enabling the model
to jointly learn rich intra-modal features and cross-modal interactions. We
further introduce an effective and straightforward two-stage training strategy,
which facilitates the direct activation of both MoE and multi-modal
capabilities. Extensive experiments across different data scales and LLM
backbone demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency and generality of our
approach. Notably, our MoIIE models with 5.5B and 11.3B activated parameters
match or even surpass the performance of existing advanced open-source MoE-LLMs
based multi-modal models that involve more activated parameters. The code is

Conclusion: 组合匹配方法有效解决了局部模糊性问题，提升了形状组装的鲁棒性。

Abstract: This paper introduces a new shape-matching methodology, combinative matching,
to combine interlocking parts for geometric shape assembly. Previous methods
for geometric assembly typically rely on aligning parts by finding identical
surfaces between the parts as in conventional shape matching and registration.
In contrast, we explicitly model two distinct properties of interlocking
shapes: 'identical surface shape' and 'opposite volume occupancy.' Our method
thus learns to establish correspondences across regions where their surface
shapes appear identical but their volumes occupy the inverted space to each
other. To facilitate this process, we also learn to align regions in rotation
by estimating their shape orientations via equivariant neural networks. The
proposed approach significantly reduces local ambiguities in matching and
allows a robust combination of parts in assembly. Experimental results on
geometric assembly benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of our method,
consistently outperforming the state of the art. Project page:

Motivation: 解决少样本类增量学习（FSCIL）中预训练模型的适应性问题，同时避免灾难性遗忘。

Method: 结合静态提示（适应预训练与下游任务差异）和动态提示（捕获实例语义），利用多模态模型生成输入感知提示。

Result: 在四个基准测试中表现优于现有方法，缓解了灾难性遗忘问题。

Conclusion: DSS-Prompt是一种简单有效的FSCIL方法，无需增量任务训练即可实现高性能。

Abstract: Learning from large-scale pre-trained models with strong generalization
ability has shown remarkable success in a wide range of downstream tasks
recently, but it is still underexplored in the challenging few-shot
class-incremental learning (FSCIL) task. It aims to continually learn new
concepts from limited training samples without forgetting the old ones at the
same time. In this paper, we introduce DSS-Prompt, a simple yet effective
approach that transforms the pre-trained Vision Transformer with minimal
modifications in the way of prompts into a strong FSCIL classifier. Concretely,
we synergistically utilize two complementary types of prompts in each
Transformer block: static prompts to bridge the domain gap between the
pre-training and downstream datasets, thus enabling better adaption; and
dynamic prompts to capture instance-aware semantics, thus enabling easy
transfer from base to novel classes. Specially, to generate dynamic prompts, we
leverage a pre-trained multi-modal model to extract input-related diverse
semantics, thereby generating complementary input-aware prompts, and then
adaptively adjust their importance across different layers. In this way, on top
of the prompted visual embeddings, a simple prototype classifier can beat
state-of-the-arts without further training on the incremental tasks. We conduct
extensive experiments on four benchmarks to validate the effectiveness of our
DSS-Prompt and show that it consistently achieves better performance than
existing approaches on all datasets and can alleviate the catastrophic
forgetting issue as well.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统跟踪方法因卡尔曼滤波和刚性IoU匹配的局限性，在复杂运动和遮挡下表现不佳。

Method: 提出MeKF（记忆辅助卡尔曼滤波）和Mo-IoU（运动自适应IoU），分别优化运动模型和匹配策略。

Result: 在DanceTrack和SportsMOT数据集上，HOTA分数分别达到67.9%和82.1%，表现优异。

Conclusion: MeMoSORT通过轻量级创新实现了高性能的实时多目标跟踪。

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) in human-dominant scenarios, which involves
continuously tracking multiple people within video sequences, remains a
significant challenge in computer vision due to targets' complex motion and
severe occlusions. Conventional tracking-by-detection methods are fundamentally
limited by their reliance on Kalman filter (KF) and rigid Intersection over
Union (IoU)-based association. The motion model in KF often mismatches
real-world object dynamics, causing filtering errors, while rigid association
struggles under occlusions, leading to identity switches or target loss. To
address these issues, we propose MeMoSORT, a simple, online, and real-time MOT
tracker with two key innovations. First, the Memory-assisted Kalman filter
(MeKF) uses memory-augmented neural networks to compensate for mismatches
between assumed and actual object motion. Second, the Motion-adaptive IoU
(Mo-IoU) adaptively expands the matching space and incorporates height
similarity to reduce the influence of detection errors and association
failures, while remaining lightweight. Experiments on DanceTrack and SportsMOT
show that MeMoSORT achieves state-of-the-art performance, with HOTA scores of
67.9\% and 82.1\%, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有单图像超分辨率方法在PBR材质上存在跨图不一致、模态特征建模不足和数据分布偏移问题。

Method: MUJICA通过跨图注意力机制改进预训练的Swin-transformer SISR模型，保留其重建能力并提升性能。

Result: MUJICA在PSNR、SSIM和LPIPS指标上表现优异，且训练高效。

Conclusion: MUJICA在PBR材质超分辨率任务中实现了先进性能，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Physically Based Rendering (PBR) materials are typically characterized by
multiple 2D texture maps such as basecolor, normal, metallic, and roughness
which encode spatially-varying bi-directional reflectance distribution function
(SVBRDF) parameters to model surface reflectance properties and microfacet
interactions. Upscaling SVBRDF material is valuable for modern 3D graphics
applications. However, existing Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR) methods
struggle with cross-map inconsistency, inadequate modeling of modality-specific
features, and limited generalization due to data distribution shifts. In this
work, we propose Multi-modal Upscaling Joint Inference via Cross-map Attention
(MUJICA), a flexible adapter that reforms pre-trained Swin-transformer-based
SISR models for PBR material super-resolution. MUJICA is seamlessly attached
after the pre-trained and frozen SISR backbone. It leverages cross-map
attention to fuse features while preserving remarkable reconstruction ability
of the pre-trained SISR model. Applied to SISR models such as SwinIR, DRCT, and
HMANet, MUJICA improves PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS scores while preserving cross-map
consistency. Experiments demonstrate that MUJICA enables efficient training
even with limited resources and delivers state-of-the-art performance on PBR
material datasets.

Method: 使用U-Net架构，结合1,414张手动标注的图像和2,000张合成的MRI图像进行训练，以提高泛化能力。

Result: 模型在未见过的照片上表现优异，Dice分数中位数超过0.98，接近人工标注的变异性水平。

Conclusion: 该工具公开可用，为脑组织照片的自动化分割提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Advances in image registration and machine learning have recently enabled
volumetric analysis of \emph{postmortem} brain tissue from conventional
photographs of coronal slabs, which are routinely collected in brain banks and
neuropathology laboratories worldwide. One caveat of this methodology is the
requirement of segmentation of the tissue from photographs, which currently
requires costly manual intervention. In this article, we present a deep
learning model to automate this process. The automatic segmentation tool relies
on a U-Net architecture that was trained with a combination of
\textit{(i)}1,414 manually segmented images of both fixed and fresh tissue,
from specimens with varying diagnoses, photographed at two different sites; and
\textit{(ii)}~2,000 synthetic images with randomized contrast and corresponding
masks generated from MRI scans for improved generalizability to unseen
photographic setups. Automated model predictions on a subset of photographs not
seen in training were analyzed to estimate performance compared to manual
labels -- including both inter- and intra-rater variability. Our model achieved
a median Dice score over 0.98, mean surface distance under 0.4~mm, and 95\%
Hausdorff distance under 1.60~mm, which approaches inter-/intra-rater levels.

Abstract: Elephant Poaching in African countries has been a decade-old problem. So much
so that African Forest Elephants are now listed as an endangered species, and
African Savannah Elephants as critically endangered by the IUCN (International
Union for Conservation of Nature). [1] Elephants are hunted primarily for their
ivory tusks which caused many elephants to be born tuskless as a genetic
modification for survival. [2] Data gathered by recent studies shows that
though poaching methods remain the same, the poaching grounds are rather
dynamic. Poachers have shifted to areas with less ranger patrols and several
other factors like watering holes, seasons, altitude etc. cause constant shifts
in poaching hotspot locations. [3] After a period of low poaching from
2000-2014, poaching numbers in African countries are now on the rise again --
WWF (World Wildlife Foundation) says there are 20,000 elephants poached
annually [4]. In African countries, anti-poaching efforts are concentrated near
towns, while a majority of poaching occurs in the deserted regions. All of
these factors result in the need for a Computer Vision Model to identify
poaching hotspots through locating the geographic indicators of favorable
poaching regions. A CV model eliminates the need to manually track poachers and
account for the environmental factors to deploy resources and its combination
with satellite imagery allows us to survey large areas without disturbing local
species or cross border aviation restrictions.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了学习机制，为优化视觉语言模型的感知对齐与鲁棒性提供新思路。

Abstract: During the training of multi-modal models like CLIP, we observed an
intriguing phenomenon: the correlation with low-level human image quality
assessments peaks in the early epochs before gradually declining. This study
investigates this observation and seeks to understand its causes through two
key factors: shape-texture bias alignment and classification accuracy drop
under noise. Our findings suggest that CLIP initially learn low-level visual
features, enhancing its alignment with low-level human perception but also
increasing its sensitivity to noise and its texture bias. As training
progresses, the model shifts toward more abstract shape-based representations,
improving noise robustness but reducing alignment with low-level human
perception. These results suggest that these factors shared an underlying
learning mechanism and provide new insights into optimizing the trade-off
between perceptual alignment and robustness in vision-language models.

Conclusion: ViMoNet通过多模态数据融合，显著提升对人类行为的建模能力。

Abstract: This study investigates how large language models (LLMs) can be used to
understand human behavior using motion and video data. We think that mixing
both types is essential to completely capture the nuanced movements and
meanings of human actions, in contrast to recent models that simply concentrate
on motion data or films. To address this, we provide ViMoNet, a straightforward
yet effective framework for comprehending, characterizing, and deducing human
action. ViMoNet employs a joint training strategy that leverages the advantages
of two data types: detailed motion-text data, which is more exact, and generic
video-text data, which is more comprehensive but less detailed. This aids in
the model's acquisition of rich data regarding time and space in human
behavior. Additionally, we provide a brand new dataset named VIMOS that
contains a variety of films, motion sequences, instructions, and subtitles. We
developed ViMoNet-Bench, a standardized benchmark with carefully labeled
samples, to evaluate how well models understand human behavior. Our tests show
that ViMoNet outperforms existing methods in caption generation, motion
understanding, and behavior interpretation.

Conclusion: PAR展示了通过视频预训练迁移世界知识在机器人操作中的潜力。

Abstract: The scarcity of manipulation data has motivated the use of pretrained large
models from other modalities in robotics. In this work, we build upon
autoregressive video generation models to propose a Physical Autoregressive
Model (PAR), where physical tokens combine frames and actions to represent the
joint evolution of the robot and its environment. PAR leverages the world
knowledge embedded in video pretraining to understand physical dynamics without
requiring action pretraining, enabling accurate video prediction and consistent
action trajectories. It also adopts a DiT-based de-tokenizer to model frames
and actions as continuous tokens, mitigating quantization errors and
facilitating mutual enhancement. Furthermore, we incorporate a causal mask with
inverse kinematics, parallel training, and the KV-cache mechanism to further
improve performance and efficiency. Experiments on the ManiSkill benchmark show
that PAR achieves a 100\% success rate on the PushCube task, matches the
performance of action-pretrained baselines on other tasks, and accurately
predicts future videos with tightly aligned action trajectories. These findings
underscore a promising direction for robotic manipulation by transferring world
knowledge from autoregressive video pretraining.

### [102] [Reverse Convolution and Its Applications to Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09824)
*Xuhong Huang,Shiqi Liu,Kai Zhang,Ying Tai,Jian Yang,Hui Zeng,Lei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新颖的深度反向卷积算子，用于有效逆转深度卷积，并通过实验验证了其作为基础模块的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于转置卷积并非卷积的真正逆运算，目前神经网络中缺乏标准的反向卷积算子，因此需要开发一种新的反向卷积方法。

Method: 通过正则化最小二乘优化问题，提出深度反向卷积算子，并结合层归一化、1×1卷积和GELU激活构建反向卷积块，形成类似Transformer的结构。

Result: 实验表明，提出的反向卷积算子能有效替代传统卷积和转置卷积层，在图像恢复任务（如去噪、超分辨率和去模糊）中表现优异。

Conclusion: 该研究为深度模型设计中新算子的开发和应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: Convolution and transposed convolution are fundamental operators widely used
in neural networks. However, transposed convolution (a.k.a. deconvolution) does
not serve as a true inverse of convolution due to inherent differences in their
mathematical formulations. To date, no reverse convolution operator has been
established as a standard component in neural architectures. In this paper, we
propose a novel depthwise reverse convolution operator as an initial attempt to
effectively reverse depthwise convolution by formulating and solving a
regularized least-squares optimization problem. We thoroughly investigate its
kernel initialization, padding strategies, and other critical aspects to ensure
its effective implementation. Building upon this operator, we further construct
a reverse convolution block by combining it with layer normalization,
1$\times$1 convolution, and GELU activation, forming a Transformer-like
structure. The proposed operator and block can directly replace conventional
convolution and transposed convolution layers in existing architectures,
leading to the development of ConverseNet. Corresponding to typical image
restoration models such as DnCNN, SRResNet and USRNet, we train three variants
of ConverseNet for Gaussian denoising, super-resolution and deblurring,
respectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed reverse convolution operator as a basic building module. We hope this
work could pave the way for developing new operators in deep model design and
applications.

### [103] [Hierarchical Graph Attention Network for No-Reference Omnidirectional Image Quality Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09843)
*Hao Yang,Xu Zhang,Jiaqi Ma,Linwei Zhu,Yun Zhang,Huan Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于图神经网络的OIQA框架，通过建模视口间的结构关系来提升对空间失真非均匀性的感知能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有OIQA方法难以评估局部非均匀失真，因缺乏对质量空间变化的建模及无效的特征表示。

Method: 采用斐波那契球采样生成视口，将其表示为图节点，结合多阶段特征提取网络和图注意力网络（GAT）及图变换器建模空间依赖关系。

Result: 在两个大规模OIQA数据库上的实验表明，该方法显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效且具有强泛化能力。

Abstract: Current Omnidirectional Image Quality Assessment (OIQA) methods struggle to
evaluate locally non-uniform distortions due to inadequate modeling of spatial
variations in quality and ineffective feature representation capturing both
local details and global context. To address this, we propose a graph neural
network-based OIQA framework that explicitly models structural relationships
between viewports to enhance perception of spatial distortion non-uniformity.
Our approach employs Fibonacci sphere sampling to generate viewports with
well-structured topology, representing each as a graph node. Multi-stage
feature extraction networks then derive high-dimensional node representation.
To holistically capture spatial dependencies, we integrate a Graph Attention
Network (GAT) modeling fine-grained local distortion variations among adjacent
viewports, and a graph transformer capturing long-range quality interactions
across distant regions. Extensive experiments on two large-scale OIQA databases
with complex spatial distortions demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms existing approaches, confirming its effectiveness and strong
generalization capability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个基于小规模CelebAMask-HQ数据集的扩散模型基准，评估了无条件与有条件生成流程，比较了UNet和DiT架构，并探索了LoRA微调方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在改进人脸生成的语义对齐和可控性，特别是在数据有限的情况下。

Method: 结合了InfoNCE损失用于属性嵌入和SegFormer分割编码器，改进了多条件生成方法。

Result: 结果表明对比嵌入学习和高级分割编码在有限数据下对可控人脸生成有效。

Conclusion: 研究为小规模数据集下的可控人脸生成提供了有效方法。

Abstract: We present a benchmark of diffusion models for human face generation on a
small-scale CelebAMask-HQ dataset, evaluating both unconditional and
conditional pipelines. Our study compares UNet and DiT architectures for
unconditional generation and explores LoRA-based fine-tuning of pretrained
Stable Diffusion models as a separate experiment. Building on the
multi-conditioning approach of Giambi and Lisanti, which uses both attribute
vectors and segmentation masks, our main contribution is the integration of an
InfoNCE loss for attribute embedding and the adoption of a SegFormer-based
segmentation encoder. These enhancements improve the semantic alignment and
controllability of attribute-guided synthesis. Our results highlight the
effectiveness of contrastive embedding learning and advanced segmentation
encoding for controlled face generation in limited data settings.

*Jan Phillipp Albrecht,Jose R. A. Godinho,Christina Hübers,Deborah Schmidt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ARI3D是一款用于交互式分析X射线CT图像中区域的软件工具，旨在改善相位识别、考虑部分体积效应、提高检测限和准确性，并统一3D定量分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: X射线CT成像技术存在多种固有成像伪影（如束硬化和部分体积效应），导致用户需基于体素灰度值做出大量决策以分割和分类微结构。

Method: 提出ARI3D软件工具，通过交互式分析协议辅助用户完成3D图像中区域的分类和量化。

Result: ARI3D能够改善相位识别、处理部分体积效应、提高检测限和量化准确性，并适用于多学科领域。

Conclusion: ARI3D为3D X射线CT图像的定量分析提供了一种高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: X-ray computed tomography (CT) is the main 3D technique for imaging the
internal microstructures of materials. Quantitative analysis of the
microstructures is usually achieved by applying a sequence of steps that are
implemented to the entire 3D image. This is challenged by various imaging
artifacts inherent from the technique, e.g., beam hardening and partial volume.
Consequently, the analysis requires users to make a number of decisions to
segment and classify the microstructures based on the voxel gray-values. In
this context, a software tool, here called ARI3D, is proposed to interactively
analyze regions in three-dimensional X-ray CT images, assisting users through
the various steps of a protocol designed to classify and quantify objects
within regions of a three-dimensional image. ARI3D aims to 1) Improve phase
identification; 2) Account for partial volume effect; 3) Increase the detection
limit and accuracy of object quantification; and 4) Harmonize quantitative 3D
analysis that can be implemented in different fields of science.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现，更大的ViT模型与人类感知对齐度更低，数据增强和正则化进一步降低对齐度，尤其在重复训练周期中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索Vision Transformers（ViTs）在图像识别任务中与人类感知的对齐情况，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 系统分析模型大小、数据集大小、数据增强和正则化对ViT与人类感知对齐的影响，使用TID2013数据集。

Result: 大模型对齐度更低；增加数据多样性影响小，但重复训练降低对齐度；数据增强和正则化进一步减少对齐度。

Conclusion: 模型复杂性、训练策略与人类感知对齐之间存在权衡，需在应用中权衡这些因素。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) achieve remarkable performance in image
recognition tasks, yet their alignment with human perception remains largely
unexplored. This study systematically analyzes how model size, dataset size,
data augmentation and regularization impact ViT perceptual alignment with human
judgments on the TID2013 dataset. Our findings confirm that larger models
exhibit lower perceptual alignment, consistent with previous works. Increasing
dataset diversity has a minimal impact, but exposing models to the same images
more times reduces alignment. Stronger data augmentation and regularization
further decrease alignment, especially in models exposed to repeated training
cycles. These results highlight a trade-off between model complexity, training
strategies, and alignment with human perception, raising important
considerations for applications requiring human-like visual understanding.

### [107] [OneVAE: Joint Discrete and Continuous Optimization Helps Discrete Video VAE Train Better](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09857)
*Yupeng Zhou,Zhen Li,Ziheng Ouyang,Yuming Chen,Ruoyi Du,Daquan Zhou,Bin Fu,Yihao Liu,Peng Gao,Ming-Ming Cheng,Qibin Hou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合连续和离散视频VAE的方法OneVAE，通过FSQ保留连续VAE的先验，加速训练并提升性能，同时引入多令牌量化机制和增强首帧重建，实现了在单一网络中同时优化两种表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离散视频VAE存在训练不稳定、时间长和重建质量差的问题，而连续VAE训练更简单且性能优越，因此希望通过结合两者的优势来改进离散视频VAE。

Method: 利用FSQ保留连续VAE先验，提出多令牌量化机制和增强首帧重建，并设计联合离散-连续优化方案。

Result: 训练速度提升数倍，收敛时性能更优，PSNR提升近1 dB，并在高压缩视频VAE中显著改善重建效果。

Conclusion: OneVAE成功统一了连续和离散表示，首次在单一网络中实现了两者的竞争性能。

Abstract: Encoding videos into discrete tokens could align with text tokens to
facilitate concise and unified multi-modal LLMs, yet introducing significant
spatiotemporal compression compared to continuous video representation.
Previous discrete video VAEs experienced unstable training, long training time,
and degraded reconstruction quality. Given the easier training and superior
performance of continuous VAEs, an intuitive idea is to enhance discrete video
VAEs by leveraging continuous VAEs. After rethinking the intrinsic link between
discrete and continuous representations, we found that FSQ could effectively
preserve pre-trained continuous VAE priors compared to other quantization
methods. By leveraging continuous VAE priors, it converges several times faster
than training from scratch and achieves superior performance at convergence.
Meanwhile, two structural improvements are proposed. First, inspired by how
continuous VAEs enhance reconstruction via enlarged latent dimensions, we
introduce a multi-token quantization mechanism, which achieves nearly a 1 dB
improvement in PSNR without compromising the token compression ratio. Second,
to tackle reconstruction challenges in high-compression video VAEs, we
strengthen first-frame reconstruction, enabling the causal VAE to leverage this
information in subsequent frames and markedly improving the performance of 4 x
16 x 16 discrete VAEs. Furthermore, we propose a joint discrete-continuous
optimization scheme that unifies the two paradigms and, for the first time,
achieves competitive performance on both continuous and discrete
representations within a single network. We name our method OneVAE to reflect
this connection.

TL;DR: HumanGenesis框架通过四个协作代理解决合成人类动态中的几何不一致和运动泛化问题，显著提升表现力、几何保真度和场景整合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在几何一致性和运动泛化方面存在不足，导致重建粗糙和场景不协调。

Method: 结合几何与生成建模，通过Reconstructor、Critique Agent、Pose Guider和Video Harmonizer四个代理协作完成。

Result: 在文本引导合成、视频重演和新姿势泛化任务中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: HumanGenesis框架有效解决了现有挑战，提升了合成人类动态的质量和一致性。

Abstract: \textbf{Synthetic human dynamics} aims to generate photorealistic videos of
human subjects performing expressive, intention-driven motions. However,
current approaches face two core challenges: (1) \emph{geometric inconsistency}
and \emph{coarse reconstruction}, due to limited 3D modeling and detail
preservation; and (2) \emph{motion generalization limitations} and \emph{scene
inharmonization}, stemming from weak generative capabilities. To address these,
we present \textbf{HumanGenesis}, a framework that integrates geometric and
generative modeling through four collaborative agents: (1)
\textbf{Reconstructor} builds 3D-consistent human-scene representations from
monocular video using 3D Gaussian Splatting and deformation decomposition. (2)
\textbf{Critique Agent} enhances reconstruction fidelity by identifying and
refining poor regions via multi-round MLLM-based reflection. (3) \textbf{Pose
Guider} enables motion generalization by generating expressive pose sequences
using time-aware parametric encoders. (4) \textbf{Video Harmonizer} synthesizes
photorealistic, coherent video via a hybrid rendering pipeline with diffusion,
refining the Reconstructor through a Back-to-4D feedback loop. HumanGenesis
achieves state-of-the-art performance on tasks including text-guided synthesis,
video reenactment, and novel-pose generalization, significantly improving
expressiveness, geometric fidelity, and scene integration.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为COME的通用框架，用于解决超声图像分析中多异质数据集训练的挑战，通过双结构-语义共享专家和源特定专家的协作，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统单数据集训练在新数据分布下表现不佳，尤其是在超声图像分析中，由于数据有限、声学阴影和斑点噪声等问题，构建一个通用的多异质数据集框架变得至关重要。

Method: COME通过建立双结构-语义共享专家，创建通用表示空间，并与源特定专家协作，提取判别性特征。该方法利用跨数据集经验分布，为小批量或未见数据提供通用超声先验。

Result: 在三种评估模式（单数据集、器官内和器官间集成数据集）下，COME表现优于现有方法，平均AP显著提升。

Conclusion: COME通过协作异构专家，实现了对超声图像分析的鲁棒泛化，为多数据集训练提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Conventional single-dataset training often fails with new data distributions,
especially in ultrasound (US) image analysis due to limited data, acoustic
shadows, and speckle noise. Therefore, constructing a universal framework for
multi-heterogeneous US datasets is imperative. However, a key challenge arises:
how to effectively mitigate inter-dataset interference while preserving
dataset-specific discriminative features for robust downstream task? Previous
approaches utilize either a single source-specific decoder or a domain
adaptation strategy, but these methods experienced a decline in performance
when applied to other domains. Considering this, we propose a Universal
Collaborative Mixture of Heterogeneous Source-Specific Experts (COME).
Specifically, COME establishes dual structure-semantic shared experts that
create a universal representation space and then collaborate with
source-specific experts to extract discriminative features through providing
complementary features. This design enables robust generalization by leveraging
cross-datasets experience distributions and providing universal US priors for
small-batch or unseen data scenarios. Extensive experiments under three
evaluation modes (single-dataset, intra-organ, and inter-organ integration
datasets) demonstrate COME's superiority, achieving significant mean AP
improvements over state-of-the-art methods. Our project is available at:

Motivation: 传统RGB相机在光照不足、动态范围有限和运动模糊方面存在局限性，而事件相机具有低功耗、高时间分辨率和高动态范围的优势，适合高速运动和低光场景的重建。

Method: 提出事件驱动的初始化方案和事件自适应切片泼溅技术，结合强度重要性剪枝和自适应对比度阈值优化，实现时间感知重建。

Result: E-4DGS在合成多视角事件流数据集上表现优于纯事件和事件-RGB融合基线方法。

Conclusion: E-4DGS为多视角事件流重建提供了一种新方法，推动了快速场景捕捉的探索。

Abstract: Novel view synthesis and 4D reconstruction techniques predominantly rely on
RGB cameras, thereby inheriting inherent limitations such as the dependence on
adequate lighting, susceptibility to motion blur, and a limited dynamic range.
Event cameras, offering advantages of low power, high temporal resolution and
high dynamic range, have brought a new perspective to addressing the scene
reconstruction challenges in high-speed motion and low-light scenes. To this
end, we propose E-4DGS, the first event-driven dynamic Gaussian Splatting
approach, for novel view synthesis from multi-view event streams with
fast-moving cameras. Specifically, we introduce an event-based initialization
scheme to ensure stable training and propose event-adaptive slicing splatting
for time-aware reconstruction. Additionally, we employ intensity importance
pruning to eliminate floating artifacts and enhance 3D consistency, while
incorporating an adaptive contrast threshold for more precise optimization. We
design a synthetic multi-view camera setup with six moving event cameras
surrounding the object in a 360-degree configuration and provide a benchmark
multi-view event stream dataset that captures challenging motion scenarios. Our
approach outperforms both event-only and event-RGB fusion baselines and paves
the way for the exploration of multi-view event-based reconstruction as a novel
approach for rapid scene capture.

Abstract: Detection of face forgery videos remains a formidable challenge in the field
of digital forensics, especially the generalization to unseen datasets and
common perturbations. In this paper, we tackle this issue by leveraging the
synergy between audio and visual speech elements, embarking on a novel approach
through audio-visual speech representation learning. Our work is motivated by
the finding that audio signals, enriched with speech content, can provide
precise information effectively reflecting facial movements. To this end, we
first learn precise audio-visual speech representations on real videos via a
self-supervised masked prediction task, which encodes both local and global
semantic information simultaneously. Then, the derived model is directly
transferred to the forgery detection task. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of
cross-dataset generalization and robustness, without the participation of any
fake video in model training. Code is available at

Abstract: Cell detection, segmentation and classification are essential for analyzing
tumor microenvironments (TME) on hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) slides. Existing
methods suffer from poor performance on understudied cell types (rare or not
present in public datasets) and limited cross-domain generalization. To address
these shortcomings, we introduce HistoPLUS, a state-of-the-art model for cell
analysis, trained on a novel curated pan-cancer dataset of 108,722 nuclei
covering 13 cell types. In external validation across 4 independent cohorts,
HistoPLUS outperforms current state-of-the-art models in detection quality by
5.2% and overall F1 classification score by 23.7%, while using 5x fewer
parameters. Notably, HistoPLUS unlocks the study of 7 understudied cell types
and brings significant improvements on 8 of 13 cell types. Moreover, we show
that HistoPLUS robustly transfers to two oncology indications unseen during
training. To support broader TME biomarker research, we release the model
weights and inference code at https://github.com/owkin/histoplus/.

Motivation: 解决历史手稿数字化中HTR系统因数据分布差异导致的性能问题，尤其是低资源转录场景。

Method: 比较三种HTG模型（生成对抗、扩散和自回归范式），分析合成数据的视觉和语言特征对微调结果的影响。

Result: 提供了HTG模型对HTR微调效果的定量分析，揭示了当前方法的局限性和改进方向。

Conclusion: HTG方法在低资源HTR中有潜力，但仍需进一步改进。

Abstract: The digitization of historical manuscripts presents significant challenges
for Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) systems, particularly when dealing with
small, author-specific collections that diverge from the training data
distributions. Handwritten Text Generation (HTG) techniques, which generate
synthetic data tailored to specific handwriting styles, offer a promising
solution to address these challenges. However, the effectiveness of various HTG
models in enhancing HTR performance, especially in low-resource transcription
settings, has not been thoroughly evaluated. In this work, we systematically
compare three state-of-the-art styled HTG models (representing the generative
adversarial, diffusion, and autoregressive paradigms for HTG) to assess their
impact on HTR fine-tuning. We analyze how visual and linguistic characteristics
of synthetic data influence fine-tuning outcomes and provide quantitative
guidelines for selecting the most effective HTG model. The results of our
analysis provide insights into the current capabilities of HTG methods and
highlight key areas for further improvement in their application to
low-resource HTR.

TL;DR: AST-n框架通过从中间噪声水平启动反向扩散并结合高阶ODE求解器，显著加速低剂量CT去噪，同时保持图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低剂量CT（LDCT）减少辐射但增加图像噪声，影响诊断信心，需高效去噪方法。

Method: 提出AST-n框架，结合高阶ODE求解器和条件模型，减少采样步骤。

Result: AST-25在25步内实现PSNR>38 dB和SSIM>0.95，推理时间从16秒降至1秒。

Conclusion: AST-n结合高阶求解器可快速重建LDCT图像，提升扩散模型在临床中的实用性。

Abstract: Low-dose CT (LDCT) protocols reduce radiation exposure but increase image
noise, compromising diagnostic confidence. Diffusion-based generative models
have shown promise for LDCT denoising by learning image priors and performing
iterative refinement. In this work, we introduce AST-n, an accelerated
inference framework that initiates reverse diffusion from intermediate noise
levels, and integrate high-order ODE solvers within conditioned models to
further reduce sampling steps. We evaluate two acceleration paradigms--AST-n
sampling and standard scheduling with high-order solvers -- on the Low Dose CT
Grand Challenge dataset, covering head, abdominal, and chest scans at 10-25 %
of standard dose. Conditioned models using only 25 steps (AST-25) achieve peak
signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) above 38 dB and structural similarity index (SSIM)
above 0.95, closely matching standard baselines while cutting inference time
from ~16 seg to under 1 seg per slice. Unconditional sampling suffers
substantial quality loss, underscoring the necessity of conditioning. We also
assess DDIM inversion, which yields marginal PSNR gains at the cost of doubling
inference time, limiting its clinical practicality. Our results demonstrate
that AST-n with high-order samplers enables rapid LDCT reconstruction without
significant loss of image fidelity, advancing the feasibility of
diffusion-based methods in clinical workflows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何简化视觉上下文学习过程，避免复杂的训练和额外数据需求，提高通用性。

Method: 在Stable Diffusion的自注意力层中重新计算注意力，显式结合查询和示例提示的上下文。

Result: 在六种视觉任务中表现优异，例如前景分割任务在Pascal-5i数据集上mIoU提升8.9%。

Conclusion: Stable Diffusion模型可用于高效视觉上下文学习，且通过集成多提示进一步提升性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLM) in natural language processing (NLP) have
demonstrated great potential for in-context learning (ICL) -- the ability to
leverage a few sets of example prompts to adapt to various tasks without having
to explicitly update the model weights. ICL has recently been explored for
computer vision tasks with promising early outcomes. These approaches involve
specialized training and/or additional data that complicate the process and
limit its generalizability. In this work, we show that off-the-shelf Stable
Diffusion models can be repurposed for visual in-context learning (V-ICL).
Specifically, we formulate an in-place attention re-computation within the
self-attention layers of the Stable Diffusion architecture that explicitly
incorporates context between the query and example prompts. Without any
additional fine-tuning, we show that this repurposed Stable Diffusion model is
able to adapt to six different tasks: foreground segmentation, single object
detection, semantic segmentation, keypoint detection, edge detection, and
colorization. For example, the proposed approach improves the mean intersection
over union (mIoU) for the foreground segmentation task on Pascal-5i dataset by
8.9% and 3.2% over recent methods such as Visual Prompting and IMProv,
respectively. Additionally, we show that the proposed method is able to
effectively leverage multiple prompts through ensembling to infer the task
better and further improve the performance.

TL;DR: LIA-X是一种新型可解释肖像动画生成器，通过稀疏运动字典实现面部动态的精细控制，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在面部动态迁移中缺乏精细控制和可解释性，LIA-X旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用自编码器框架，通过稀疏运动字典将面部动态分解为可解释因素，支持“编辑-变形-渲染”策略。

Result: 在自重现和跨重现任务中表现优异，支持用户引导的精细编辑和3D感知操作。

Conclusion: LIA-X通过可解释性和控制性，为肖像动画和编辑提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce LIA-X, a novel interpretable portrait animator designed to
transfer facial dynamics from a driving video to a source portrait with
fine-grained control. LIA-X is an autoencoder that models motion transfer as a
linear navigation of motion codes in latent space. Crucially, it incorporates a
novel Sparse Motion Dictionary that enables the model to disentangle facial
dynamics into interpretable factors. Deviating from previous 'warp-render'
approaches, the interpretability of the Sparse Motion Dictionary allows LIA-X
to support a highly controllable 'edit-warp-render' strategy, enabling precise
manipulation of fine-grained facial semantics in the source portrait. This
helps to narrow initial differences with the driving video in terms of pose and
expression. Moreover, we demonstrate the scalability of LIA-X by successfully
training a large-scale model with approximately 1 billion parameters on
extensive datasets. Experimental results show that our proposed method
outperforms previous approaches in both self-reenactment and cross-reenactment
tasks across several benchmarks. Additionally, the interpretable and
controllable nature of LIA-X supports practical applications such as
fine-grained, user-guided image and video editing, as well as 3D-aware portrait
video manipulation.

Abstract: Progress in AI for automated nutritional analysis is critically hampered by
the lack of standardized evaluation methodologies and high-quality, real-world
benchmark datasets. To address this, we introduce three primary contributions.
First, we present the January Food Benchmark (JFB), a publicly available
collection of 1,000 food images with human-validated annotations. Second, we
detail a comprehensive benchmarking framework, including robust metrics and a
novel, application-oriented overall score designed to assess model performance
holistically. Third, we provide baseline results from both general-purpose
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and our own specialized model,
january/food-vision-v1. Our evaluation demonstrates that the specialized model
achieves an Overall Score of 86.2, a 12.1-point improvement over the
best-performing general-purpose configuration. This work offers the research
community a valuable new evaluation dataset and a rigorous framework to guide
and benchmark future developments in automated nutritional analysis.

*Tianqi Xiang,Yi Li,Qixiang Zhang,Xiaomeng Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种元优化分类器（MOC），通过结合多种候选分类器和元学习器，显著提升了少样本学习下的WSI分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于视觉语言基础模型（VLFM）的少样本学习方法在数据稀缺时表现不佳，需要改进。

Method: MOC包含一个元学习器和一个分类器库，前者自动优化分类器配置，后者提供多样化的候选分类器。

Result: 在TCGA-NSCLC基准测试中，MOC的AUC比现有方法提高了10.4%，在1-shot条件下提升高达26.25%。

Conclusion: MOC为临床部署中数据稀缺的问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in histopathology vision-language foundation models (VLFMs)
have shown promise in addressing data scarcity for whole slide image (WSI)
classification via zero-shot adaptation. However, these methods remain
outperformed by conventional multiple instance learning (MIL) approaches
trained on large datasets, motivating recent efforts to enhance VLFM-based WSI
classification through fewshot learning paradigms. While existing few-shot
methods improve diagnostic accuracy with limited annotations, their reliance on
conventional classifier designs introduces critical vulnerabilities to data
scarcity. To address this problem, we propose a Meta-Optimized Classifier (MOC)
comprising two core components: (1) a meta-learner that automatically optimizes
a classifier configuration from a mixture of candidate classifiers and (2) a
classifier bank housing diverse candidate classifiers to enable a holistic
pathological interpretation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MOC
outperforms prior arts in multiple few-shot benchmarks. Notably, on the
TCGA-NSCLC benchmark, MOC improves AUC by 10.4% over the state-of-the-art
few-shot VLFM-based methods, with gains up to 26.25% under 1-shot conditions,
offering a critical advancement for clinical deployments where diagnostic
training data is severely limited. Code is available at

TL;DR: PERSONA框架结合3D和扩散方法，从单张图像生成个性化3D人体化身，解决身份保持和姿态驱动变形问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D方法需多姿态视频，扩散方法难以保持身份，PERSONA结合两者优势。

Method: 利用扩散方法生成多姿态视频，通过平衡采样和几何加权优化优化3D化身。

Result: 实现从单张图像生成高质量、身份保持的3D化身。

Conclusion: PERSONA为单图像生成3D化身提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: Two major approaches exist for creating animatable human avatars. The first,
a 3D-based approach, optimizes a NeRF- or 3DGS-based avatar from videos of a
single person, achieving personalization through a disentangled identity
representation. However, modeling pose-driven deformations, such as non-rigid
cloth deformations, requires numerous pose-rich videos, which are costly and
impractical to capture in daily life. The second, a diffusion-based approach,
learns pose-driven deformations from large-scale in-the-wild videos but
struggles with identity preservation and pose-dependent identity entanglement.
We present PERSONA, a framework that combines the strengths of both approaches
to obtain a personalized 3D human avatar with pose-driven deformations from a
single image. PERSONA leverages a diffusion-based approach to generate
pose-rich videos from the input image and optimizes a 3D avatar based on them.
To ensure high authenticity and sharp renderings across diverse poses, we
introduce balanced sampling and geometry-weighted optimization. Balanced
sampling oversamples the input image to mitigate identity shifts in
diffusion-generated training videos. Geometry-weighted optimization prioritizes
geometry constraints over image loss, preserving rendering quality in diverse
poses.

Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型（VLMs）因计算和内存需求高而难以广泛应用，现有压缩方法存在模块不可比、任务单一和技术孤立的问题。

Method: 提出LLMC+工具包，支持20多种算法，涵盖五种代表性VLM家族，系统研究令牌级和模型级压缩。

Result: 发现空间和时间冗余需不同策略，令牌减少方法在多轮对话中表现不佳，联合压缩技术可实现高效压缩。

Conclusion: LLMC+为VLM压缩提供了公平评估平台，并启发了未来高效VLM的研究。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit impressive multi-modal
capabilities but suffer from prohibitive computational and memory demands, due
to their long visual token sequences and massive parameter sizes. To address
these issues, recent works have proposed training-free compression methods.
However, existing efforts often suffer from three major limitations: (1)
Current approaches do not decompose techniques into comparable modules,
hindering fair evaluation across spatial and temporal redundancy. (2)
Evaluation confined to simple single-turn tasks, failing to reflect performance
in realistic scenarios. (3) Isolated use of individual compression techniques,
without exploring their joint potential. To overcome these gaps, we introduce
LLMC+, a comprehensive VLM compression benchmark with a versatile,
plug-and-play toolkit. LLMC+ supports over 20 algorithms across five
representative VLM families and enables systematic study of token-level and
model-level compression. Our benchmark reveals that: (1) Spatial and temporal
redundancies demand distinct technical strategies. (2) Token reduction methods
degrade significantly in multi-turn dialogue and detail-sensitive tasks. (3)
Combining token and model compression achieves extreme compression with minimal
performance loss. We believe LLMC+ will facilitate fair evaluation and inspire
future research in efficient VLM. Our code is available at

<details>

Motivation: 解决真实世界图像数据在稀有场景和文本-图像对齐上的不足，利用合成数据的优势提升模型性能。

Method: 通过GPT-4o生成180K规模的合成数据集Echo-4o-Image，并基于此微调Bagel模型。提出GenEval++和Imagine-Bench两个新评测基准。

Result: Echo-4o在标准评测中表现优异，且合成数据对其他基础模型也有性能提升。

Conclusion: 合成图像数据能有效补充真实数据的不足，提升模型性能，且具有强可迁移性。

Abstract: Recently, GPT-4o has garnered significant attention for its strong
performance in image generation, yet open-source models still lag behind.
Several studies have explored distilling image data from GPT-4o to enhance
open-source models, achieving notable progress. However, a key question
remains: given that real-world image datasets already constitute a natural
source of high-quality data, why should we use GPT-4o-generated synthetic data?
In this work, we identify two key advantages of synthetic images. First, they
can complement rare scenarios in real-world datasets, such as surreal fantasy
or multi-reference image generation, which frequently occur in user queries.
Second, they provide clean and controllable supervision. Real-world data often
contains complex background noise and inherent misalignment between text
descriptions and image content, whereas synthetic images offer pure backgrounds
and long-tailed supervision signals, facilitating more accurate text-to-image
alignment. Building on these insights, we introduce Echo-4o-Image, a 180K-scale
synthetic dataset generated by GPT-4o, harnessing the power of synthetic image
data to address blind spots in real-world coverage. Using this dataset, we
fine-tune the unified multimodal generation baseline Bagel to obtain Echo-4o.
In addition, we propose two new evaluation benchmarks for a more accurate and
challenging assessment of image generation capabilities: GenEval++, which
increases instruction complexity to mitigate score saturation, and
Imagine-Bench, which focuses on evaluating both the understanding and
generation of imaginative content. Echo-4o demonstrates strong performance
across standard benchmarks. Moreover, applying Echo-4o-Image to other
foundation models (e.g., OmniGen2, BLIP3-o) yields consistent performance gains
across multiple metrics, highlighting the datasets strong transferability.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: TFZ是一种新型压缩框架，用于在二维对称和非对称二阶张量场中保留拓扑结构，适用于科学和工程领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 张量场的拓扑结构对数据分析和可视化至关重要，但传统压缩方法可能破坏这些结构。

Method: TFZ通过逐单元扫描并保留局部拓扑特征，确保全局拓扑结构的完整性。

Result: TFZ成功提升了SZ3和SPERR等科学数据压缩器的性能。

Conclusion: TFZ框架在保留张量场拓扑结构方面表现优异，适用于多种应用场景。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel compression framework, TFZ, that preserves
the topology of 2D symmetric and asymmetric second-order tensor fields defined
on flat triangular meshes. A tensor field assigns a tensor - a
multi-dimensional array of numbers - to each point in space. Tensor fields,
such as the stress and strain tensors, and the Riemann curvature tensor, are
essential to both science and engineering. The topology of tensor fields
captures the core structure of data, and is useful in various disciplines, such
as graphics (for manipulating shapes and textures) and neuroscience (for
analyzing brain structures from diffusion MRI). Lossy data compression may
distort the topology of tensor fields, thus hindering downstream analysis and
visualization tasks. TFZ ensures that certain topological features are
preserved during lossy compression. Specifically, TFZ preserves degenerate
points essential to the topology of symmetric tensor fields and retains
eigenvector and eigenvalue graphs that represent the topology of asymmetric
tensor fields. TFZ scans through each cell, preserving the local topology of
each cell, and thereby ensuring certain global topological guarantees. We
showcase the effectiveness of our framework in enhancing the lossy scientific
data compressors SZ3 and SPERR.

Method: 提出双特征引导的衰减-散射建模机制，结合RGB特征和深度信息，设计特殊损失函数和场景自适应机制。

Result: 在悬浮物密集区域和远距离场景中，重建质量显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DualPhys-GS框架有效提升水下3D重建质量，尤其在复杂水下环境中表现优异。

Abstract: In 3D reconstruction of underwater scenes, traditional methods based on
atmospheric optical models cannot effectively deal with the selective
attenuation of light wavelengths and the effect of suspended particle
scattering, which are unique to the water medium, and lead to color distortion,
geometric artifacts, and collapsing phenomena at long distances. We propose the
DualPhys-GS framework to achieve high-quality underwater reconstruction through
a dual-path optimization mechanism. Our approach further develops a dual
feature-guided attenuation-scattering modeling mechanism, the RGB-guided
attenuation optimization model combines RGB features and depth information and
can handle edge and structural details. In contrast, the multi-scale
depth-aware scattering model captures scattering effects at different scales
using a feature pyramid network and an attention mechanism. Meanwhile, we
design several special loss functions. The attenuation scattering consistency
loss ensures physical consistency. The water body type adaptive loss
dynamically adjusts the weighting coefficients. The edge-aware scattering loss
is used to maintain the sharpness of structural edges. The multi-scale feature
loss helps to capture global and local structural information. In addition, we
design a scene adaptive mechanism that can automatically identify the
water-body-type characteristics (e.g., clear coral reef waters or turbid
coastal waters) and dynamically adjust the scattering and attenuation
parameters and optimization strategies. Experimental results show that our
method outperforms existing methods in several metrics, especially in suspended
matter-dense regions and long-distance scenes, and the reconstruction quality
is significantly improved.

Conclusion: 该算法在保持原始移动方式的同时解决了锁定配置问题，并通过并行化进一步优化了性能，为自重构机器人系统提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The sliding square model is a widely used abstraction for studying
self-reconfigurable robotic systems, where modules are square-shaped robots
that move by sliding or rotating over one another. In this paper, we propose a
novel distributed algorithm that allows a group of modules to reconfigure into
a diamond shape, starting from an arbitrary side-connected configuration. It is
connectivity-preserving and operates under minimal assumptions: one leader
module, common chirality, constant memory per module, and visibility and
communication restricted to immediate neighbors. Unlike prior work, which
relaxes the original sliding square move-set, our approach uses the unmodified
move-set, addressing the additional challenge of handling locked
configurations. Our algorithm is sequential in nature and operates with a
worst-case time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ rounds, which is optimal for
sequential algorithms. To improve runtime, we introduce two parallel variants
of the algorithm. Both rely on a spanning tree data structure, allowing modules
to make decisions based on local connectivity. Our experimental results show a
significant speedup for the first variant, and linear average runtime for the
second variant, which is worst-case optimal for parallel algorithms.

Abstract: The contiguous art gallery problem was introduced at SoCG'25 in a merged
paper that combined three simultaneous results, each achieving a
polynomial-time algorithm for the problem. This problem is a variant of the
classical art gallery problem, first introduced by Klee in 1973. In the
contiguous art gallery problem, we are given a polygon P and asked to determine
the minimum number of guards needed, where each guard is assigned a contiguous
portion of the boundary of P that it can see, such that all assigned portions
together cover the boundary of P. The classical art gallery problem is NP-hard
and ER-complete, and the three independent works investigated whether this
variant admits a polynomial-time solution. Each of these works indeed presented
such a solution, with the fastest running in O(k n^5 log n) time, where n
denotes the number of vertices of P and k is the size of a minimum guard set
covering the boundary of P. We present a solution that is both considerably
simpler and significantly faster, yielding a concise and almost entirely
self-contained O(k n^2 log^2 n)-time algorithm.

Abstract: One of the most critical features for the successful operation of autonomous
UAVs is the ability to make decisions based on the information acquired from
their surroundings. Each UAV must be able to make decisions during the flight
in order to deal with uncertainties in its system and the environment, and to
further act upon the information being received. Such decisions influence the
future behavior of the UAV, which is expressed as the path plan. Thus,
decision-making in path planning is an enabling technique for deploying
autonomous UAVs in real-world applications. This survey provides an overview of
existing studies that use aspects of decision-making in path planning,
presenting the research strands for Exploration Path Planning and Informative
Path Planning, and focusing on characteristics of how data have been modeled

Abstract: Autonomous robots that rely on deep neural network controllers pose critical
challenges for safety prediction, especially under partial observability and
distribution shift. Traditional model-based verification techniques are limited
in scalability and require access to low-dimensional state models, while
model-free methods often lack reliability guarantees. This paper addresses
these limitations by introducing a framework for calibrated safety prediction
in end-to-end vision-controlled systems, where neither the state-transition
model nor the observation model is accessible. Building on the foundation of
world models, we leverage variational autoencoders and recurrent predictors to
forecast future latent trajectories from raw image sequences and estimate the
probability of satisfying safety properties. We distinguish between monolithic
and composite prediction pipelines and introduce a calibration mechanism to
quantify prediction confidence. In long-horizon predictions from
high-dimensional observations, the forecasted inputs to the safety evaluator
can deviate significantly from the training distribution due to compounding
prediction errors and changing environmental conditions, leading to
miscalibrated risk estimates. To address this, we incorporate unsupervised
domain adaptation to ensure robustness of safety evaluation under distribution
shift in predictions without requiring manual labels. Our formulation provides
theoretical calibration guarantees and supports practical evaluation across
long prediction horizons. Experimental results on three benchmarks show that
our UDA-equipped evaluators maintain high accuracy and substantially lower
false positive rates under distribution shift. Similarly, world model-based
composite predictors outperform their monolithic counterparts on long-horizon
tasks, and our conformal calibration provides reliable statistical bounds.

Result: 在仿真和真实机器人实验中，CLF-RL表现出比基线RL策略更强的鲁棒性和性能。

Conclusion: 提出的框架显著提升了RL策略的鲁棒性和性能，且部署时仅需轻量级策略。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in generating robust locomotion
policies for bipedal robots, but often suffers from tedious reward design and
sensitivity to poorly shaped objectives. In this work, we propose a structured
reward shaping framework that leverages model-based trajectory generation and
control Lyapunov functions (CLFs) to guide policy learning. We explore two
model-based planners for generating reference trajectories: a reduced-order
linear inverted pendulum (LIP) model for velocity-conditioned motion planning,
and a precomputed gait library based on hybrid zero dynamics (HZD) using
full-order dynamics. These planners define desired end-effector and joint
trajectories, which are used to construct CLF-based rewards that penalize
tracking error and encourage rapid convergence. This formulation provides
meaningful intermediate rewards, and is straightforward to implement once a
reference is available. Both the reference trajectories and CLF shaping are
used only during training, resulting in a lightweight policy at deployment. We
validate our method both in simulation and through extensive real-world
experiments on a Unitree G1 robot. CLF-RL demonstrates significantly improved
robustness relative to the baseline RL policy and better performance than a
classic tracking reward RL formulation.

Abstract: Vision-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE) requires
agents to follow natural language instructions through free-form 3D spaces.
Existing VLN-CE approaches typically use a two-stage waypoint planning
framework, where a high-level waypoint predictor generates the navigable
waypoints, and then a navigation planner suggests the intermediate goals in the
high-level action space. However, this two-stage decomposition framework
suffers from: (1) global sub-optimization due to the proxy objective in each
stage, and (2) a performance bottleneck caused by the strong reliance on the
quality of the first-stage predicted waypoints. To address these limitations,
we propose DAgger Diffusion Navigation (DifNav), an end-to-end optimized VLN-CE
policy that unifies the traditional two stages, i.e. waypoint generation and
planning, into a single diffusion policy. Notably, DifNav employs a conditional
diffusion policy to directly model multi-modal action distributions over future
actions in continuous navigation space, eliminating the need for a waypoint
predictor while enabling the agent to capture multiple possible
instruction-following behaviors. To address the issues of compounding error in
imitation learning and enhance spatial reasoning in long-horizon navigation
tasks, we employ DAgger for online policy training and expert trajectory
augmentation, and use the aggregated data to further fine-tune the policy. This
approach significantly improves the policy's robustness and its ability to
recover from error states. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets
demonstrate that, even without a waypoint predictor, the proposed method
substantially outperforms previous state-of-the-art two-stage waypoint-based
models in terms of navigation performance. Our code is available at:

*Junheon Yoon,Woo-Jeong Baek,Jaeheung Park*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于RMPCC的机器人路径跟踪框架，能在动态环境中以100 Hz频率避开障碍物、奇异点和自碰撞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有路径跟踪方法依赖时间参数化，难以同时处理碰撞、奇异点避免和运动学限制，导致路径误差较大。

Method: 通过路径参数化参考路径，利用RMPCC进行优化，引入CBF避免碰撞和奇异点，采用雅可比线性化和高斯-牛顿近似求解非线性问题。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在动态环境中表现优异，路径误差和加速度低，计算速度比现有方法快10倍。

Conclusion: RMPCC框架在动态环境中高效、稳定，适用于实时机器人路径跟踪。

Abstract: This contribution presents a robot path-following framework via Reactive
Model Predictive Contouring Control (RMPCC) that successfully avoids obstacles,
singularities and self-collisions in dynamic environments at 100 Hz. Many
path-following methods rely on the time parametrization, but struggle to handle
collision and singularity avoidance while adhering kinematic limits or other
constraints. Specifically, the error between the desired path and the actual
position can become large when executing evasive maneuvers. Thus, this paper
derives a method that parametrizes the reference path by a path parameter and
performs the optimization via RMPCC. In particular, Control Barrier Functions
(CBFs) are introduced to avoid collisions and singularities in dynamic
environments. A Jacobian-based linearization and Gauss-Newton Hessian
approximation enable solving the nonlinear RMPCC problem at 100 Hz,
outperforming state-of-the-art methods by a factor of 10. Experiments confirm
that the framework handles dynamic obstacles in real-world settings with low
contouring error and low robot acceleration.

Result: 仿真实验验证了SMART-OC的有效性，USV能够快速重新规划路径以避开障碍物并利用洋流成功到达目标。

Conclusion: SMART-OC为USV在动态环境中导航提供了一种高效且安全的解决方案。

Abstract: Typical marine environments are highly complex with spatio-temporally varying
currents and dynamic obstacles, presenting significant challenges to Unmanned
Surface Vehicles (USVs) for safe and efficient navigation. Thus, the USVs need
to continuously adapt their paths with real-time information to avoid
collisions and follow the path of least resistance to the goal via exploiting
ocean currents. In this regard, we introduce a novel algorithm, called
Self-Morphing Adaptive Replanning Tree for dynamic Obstacles and Currents
(SMART-OC), that facilitates real-time time-risk optimal replanning in dynamic
environments. SMART-OC integrates the obstacle risks along a path with the time
cost to reach the goal to find the time-risk optimal path. The effectiveness of
SMART-OC is validated by simulation experiments, which demonstrate that the USV
performs fast replannings to avoid dynamic obstacles and exploit ocean currents
to successfully reach the goal.

Conclusion: 该框架为未来3D空间电缆布线提供了参考，具有可重构性和高效性。

Abstract: The manipulation of deformable linear flexures has a wide range of
applications in industry, such as cable routing in automotive manufacturing and
textile production. Cable routing, as a complex multi-stage robot manipulation
scenario, is a challenging task for robot automation. Common parallel
two-finger grippers have the risk of over-squeezing and over-tension when
grasping and guiding cables. In this paper, a novel eagle-inspired fingernail
is designed and mounted on the gripper fingers, which helps with cable grasping
on planar surfaces and in-hand cable guiding operations. Then we present a
single-grasp end-to-end 3D cable routing framework utilizing the proposed
fingernails, instead of the common pick-and-place strategy. Continuous control
is achieved to efficiently manipulate cables through vision-based state
estimation of task configurations and offline trajectory planning based on
motion primitives. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed framework with
a variety of cables and channel slots, significantly outperforming the
pick-and-place manipulation process under equivalent perceptual conditions. Our
reconfigurable task setting and the proposed framework provide a reference for
future cable routing manipulations in 3D space.

Abstract: Multi-vehicle trajectory planning (MVTP) is one of the key challenges in
multi-robot systems (MRSs) and has broad applications across various fields.
This paper presents ESCoT, an enhanced step-based coordinate trajectory
planning method for multiple car-like robots. ESCoT incorporates two key
strategies: collaborative planning for local robot groups and replanning for
duplicate configurations. These strategies effectively enhance the performance
of step-based MVTP methods. Through extensive experiments, we show that ESCoT
1) in sparse scenarios, significantly improves solution quality compared to
baseline step-based method, achieving up to 70% improvement in typical conflict
scenarios and 34% in randomly generated scenarios, while maintaining high
solving efficiency; and 2) in dense scenarios, outperforms all baseline
methods, maintains a success rate of over 50% even in the most challenging
configurations. The results demonstrate that ESCoT effectively solves MVTP,
further extending the capabilities of step-based methods. Finally, practical
robot tests validate the algorithm's applicability in real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: HapticGiant为高度沉浸式虚拟现实应用铺平了道路。

Abstract: Research in virtual reality and haptic technologies has consistently aimed to

human arm. In this paper, we present HapticGiant, a novel large-scale
kinesthetic haptic interface designed to match the properties of the human arm
as closely as possible and to facilitate natural user locomotion while
providing full haptic feedback. The interface incorporates a novel
admittance-type force control scheme, leveraging hierarchical optimization to
render both arbitrary serial kinematic chains and Cartesian admittances.
Notably, the proposed control scheme natively accounts for system limitations,
including joint and Cartesian constraints, as well as singularities.
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of HapticGiant and its
control scheme, paving the way for highly immersive virtual reality

Abstract: As intelligent robots become more integrated into human environments, there
is a growing need for intuitive and reliable Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)
interfaces that are adaptable and more natural to interact with. Traditional
robot control methods often require users to adapt to interfaces or memorize
predefined commands, limiting usability in dynamic, unstructured environments.
This paper presents a novel framework that bridges natural language
understanding and robotic execution by combining Large Language Models (LLMs)
with Behavior Trees. This integration enables robots to interpret natural
language instructions given by users and translate them into executable actions
by activating domain-specific plugins. The system supports scalable and modular
integration, with a primary focus on perception-based functionalities, such as
person tracking and hand gesture recognition. To evaluate the system, a series
of real-world experiments was conducted across diverse environments.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach is practical in
real-world scenarios, with an average cognition-to-execution accuracy of
approximately 94%, making a significant contribution to HRI systems and robots.

Abstract: To enable robots to develop human-like fine manipulation, it is essential to
understand how mechanical compliance, multi-modal sensing, and purposeful
interaction jointly shape tactile perception. In this study, we use a dedicated
modular e-Skin with tunable mechanical compliance and multi-modal sensing
(normal, shear forces and vibrations) to systematically investigate how sensing
embodiment and interaction strategies influence robotic perception of objects.
Leveraging a curated set of soft wave objects with controlled viscoelastic and
surface properties, we explore a rich set of palpation primitives-pressing,
precession, sliding that vary indentation depth, frequency, and directionality.
In addition, we propose the latent filter, an unsupervised, action-conditioned
deep state-space model of the sophisticated interaction dynamics and infer
causal mechanical properties into a structured latent space. This provides
generalizable and in-depth interpretable representation of how embodiment and
interaction determine and influence perception. Our investigation demonstrates
that multi-modal sensing outperforms uni-modal sensing. It highlights a nuanced
interaction between the environment and mechanical properties of e-Skin, which
should be examined alongside the interaction by incorporating temporal
dynamics.

Abstract: This paper presents an object-aware whole-body bilateral teleoperation
framework for wheeled humanoid loco-manipulation. This framework combines
whole-body bilateral teleoperation with an online multi-stage object inertial
parameter estimation module, which is the core technical contribution of this
work. The multi-stage process sequentially integrates a vision-based object
size estimator, an initial parameter guess generated by a large vision-language
model (VLM), and a decoupled hierarchical sampling strategy. The visual size
estimate and VLM prior offer a strong initial guess of the object's inertial
parameters, significantly reducing the search space for sampling-based
refinement and improving the overall estimation speed. A hierarchical strategy
first estimates mass and center of mass, then infers inertia from object size
to ensure physically feasible parameters, while a decoupled multi-hypothesis
scheme enhances robustness to VLM prior errors. Our estimator operates in
parallel with high-fidelity simulation and hardware, enabling real-time online
updates. The estimated parameters are then used to update the wheeled
humanoid's equilibrium point, allowing the operator to focus more on locomotion
and manipulation. This integration improves the haptic force feedback for
dynamic synchronization, enabling more dynamic whole-body teleoperation. By
compensating for object dynamics using the estimated parameters, the framework
also improves manipulation tracking while preserving compliant behavior. We
validate the system on a customized wheeled humanoid with a robotic gripper and
human-machine interface, demonstrating real-time execution of lifting,
delivering, and releasing tasks with a payload weighing approximately one-third
of the robot's body weight.

Abstract: Human-robot teaming (HRT) systems often rely on large-scale datasets of human
and robot interactions, especially for close-proximity collaboration tasks such
as human-robot handovers. Learning robot manipulation policies from raw,
real-world image data requires a large number of robot-action trials in the
physical environment. Although simulation training offers a cost-effective
alternative, the visual domain gap between simulation and robot workspace
remains a major limitation. We introduce a method for training HRT policies,
focusing on human-to-robot handovers, solely from RGB images without the need
for real-robot training or real-robot data collection. The goal is to enable
the robot to reliably receive objects from a human with stable grasping while
avoiding collisions with the human hand. The proposed policy learner leverages
sparse-view Gaussian Splatting reconstruction of human-to-robot handover scenes
to generate robot demonstrations containing image-action pairs captured with a
camera mounted on the robot gripper. As a result, the simulated camera pose
changes in the reconstructed scene can be directly translated into gripper pose
changes. Experiments in both Gaussian Splatting reconstructed scene and
real-world human-to-robot handover experiments demonstrate that our method
serves as a new and effective representation for the human-to-robot handover
task, contributing to more seamless and robust HRT.

Abstract: Exoskeletons have been shown to effectively assist humans during steady
locomotion. However, their effects on non-steady locomotion, characterized by
nonlinear phase progression within a gait cycle, remain insufficiently
explored, particularly across diverse activities. This work presents a shank
angle-based control system that enables the exoskeleton to maintain real-time
coordination with human gait, even under phase perturbations, while dynamically
shaping assistance profiles to match the biological ankle moment patterns
across walking, running, stair negotiation tasks. The control system consists
of an assistance profile online generation method and a model-based feedforward
control method. The assistance profile is formulated as a dual-Gaussian model
with the shank angle as the independent variable. Leveraging only IMU
measurements, the model parameters are updated online each stride to adapt to
inter- and intra-individual biomechanical variability. The profile tracking
control employs a human-exoskeleton kinematics and stiffness model as a
feedforward component, reducing reliance on historical control data due to the
lack of clear and consistent periodicity in non-steady locomotion. Three
experiments were conducted using a lightweight soft exoskeleton with multiple
subjects. The results validated the effectiveness of each individual method,
demonstrated the robustness of the control system against gait perturbations
across various activities, and revealed positive biomechanical and
physiological responses of human users to the exoskeleton's mechanical
assistance.

Abstract: The legged locomotion in spatially constrained structures (called crawl
spaces) is challenging. In crawl spaces, current exteroceptive locomotion
learning methods are limited by large noises and errors of the sensors in
possible low visibility conditions, and current proprioceptive locomotion
learning methods are difficult in traversing crawl spaces because only ground
features are inferred. In this study, a point cloud supervised proprioceptive
locomotion reinforcement learning method for legged robots in crawl spaces is
proposed. A state estimation network is designed to estimate the robot's
surrounding ground and spatial features as well as the robot's collision states
using historical proprioceptive sensor data. The point cloud is represented in
polar coordinate frame and a point cloud processing method is proposed to
efficiently extract the ground and spatial features that are used to supervise
the state estimation network learning. Comprehensive reward functions that
guide the robot to traverse through crawl spaces after collisions are designed.
Experiments demonstrate that, compared to existing methods, our method exhibits
more agile locomotion in crawl spaces. This study enhances the ability of
legged robots to traverse spatially constrained environments without requiring
exteroceptive sensors.

Abstract: The creation of human-like humanoid robots is hindered by a fundamental
fragmentation: data processing and learning algorithms are rarely universal
across different robot morphologies. This paper introduces the Generalized
Behavior Cloning (GBC) framework, a comprehensive and unified solution designed
to solve this end-to-end challenge. GBC establishes a complete pathway from
human motion to robot action through three synergistic innovations. First, an
adaptive data pipeline leverages a differentiable IK network to automatically
retarget any human MoCap data to any humanoid. Building on this foundation, our
novel DAgger-MMPPO algorithm with its MMTransformer architecture learns robust,
high-fidelity imitation policies. To complete the ecosystem, the entire
framework is delivered as an efficient, open-source platform based on Isaac
Lab, empowering the community to deploy the full workflow via simple
configuration scripts. We validate the power and generality of GBC by training
policies on multiple heterogeneous humanoids, demonstrating excellent
performance and transfer to novel motions. This work establishes the first
practical and unified pathway for creating truly generalized humanoid
controllers.

Abstract: Vision-driven autonomous river following by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles is
critical for applications such as rescue, surveillance, and environmental
monitoring, particularly in dense riverine environments where GPS signals are
unreliable. We formalize river following as a coverage control problem in which
the reward function is submodular, yielding diminishing returns as more unique
river segments are visited, thereby framing the task as a Submodular Markov
Decision Process. First, we introduce Marginal Gain Advantage Estimation, which
refines the reward advantage function by using a sliding window baseline
computed from historical episodic returns, thus aligning the advantage
estimation with the agent's evolving recognition of action value in
non-Markovian settings. Second, we develop a Semantic Dynamics Model based on
patchified water semantic masks that provides more interpretable and
data-efficient short-term prediction of future observations compared to latent
vision dynamics models. Third, we present the Constrained Actor Dynamics
Estimator architecture, which integrates the actor, the cost estimator, and SDM
for cost advantage estimation to form a model-based SafeRL framework capable of
solving partially observable Constrained Submodular Markov Decision Processes.
Simulation results demonstrate that MGAE achieves faster convergence and
superior performance over traditional critic-based methods like Generalized
Advantage Estimation. SDM provides more accurate short-term state predictions
that enable the cost estimator to better predict potential violations. Overall,
CADE effectively integrates safety regulation into model-based RL, with the
Lagrangian approach achieving the soft balance of reward and safety during
training, while the safety layer enhances performance during inference by hard
action overlay.

Abstract: Robot manipulation research still suffers from significant data scarcity:
even the largest robot datasets are orders of magnitude smaller and less
diverse than those that fueled recent breakthroughs in language and vision. We
introduce Masquerade, a method that edits in-the-wild egocentric human videos
to bridge the visual embodiment gap between humans and robots and then learns a
robot policy with these edited videos. Our pipeline turns each human video into
robotized demonstrations by (i) estimating 3-D hand poses, (ii) inpainting the
human arms, and (iii) overlaying a rendered bimanual robot that tracks the
recovered end-effector trajectories. Pre-training a visual encoder to predict
future 2-D robot keypoints on 675K frames of these edited clips, and continuing
that auxiliary loss while fine-tuning a diffusion policy head on only 50 robot
demonstrations per task, yields policies that generalize significantly better
than prior work. On three long-horizon, bimanual kitchen tasks evaluated in
three unseen scenes each, Masquerade outperforms baselines by 5-6x. Ablations
show that both the robot overlay and co-training are indispensable, and
performance scales logarithmically with the amount of edited human video. These
results demonstrate that explicitly closing the visual embodiment gap unlocks a
vast, readily available source of data from human videos that can be used to
improve robot policies.
