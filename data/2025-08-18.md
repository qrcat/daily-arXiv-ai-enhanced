### [1] [Privacy Enhancement for Gaze Data Using a Noise-Infused Autoencoder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10918)
*Samantha Aziz,Oleg Komogortsev*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于潜在噪声自编码器的隐私增强机制，保护用户视线数据不被未经同意重新识别，同时保持数据的可用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 保护用户视线数据的隐私，防止未经同意的重新识别，同时确保数据在良性任务中的可用性。

Method: 使用潜在噪声自编码器对视线信号进行处理，平衡隐私与实用性。

Result: 显著降低生物识别的可识别性，同时实用性损失最小，且保留生理学上合理的视线模式。

Conclusion: 该机制为视线数据隐私保护提供了有效且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: We present a privacy-enhancing mechanism for gaze signals using a
latent-noise autoencoder that prevents users from being re-identified across
play sessions without their consent, while retaining the usability of the data
for benign tasks. We evaluate privacy-utility trade-offs across biometric
identification and gaze prediction tasks, showing that our approach
significantly reduces biometric identifiability with minimal utility
degradation. Unlike prior methods in this direction, our framework retains
physiologically plausible gaze patterns suitable for downstream use, which
produces favorable privacy-utility trade-off. This work advances privacy in
gaze-based systems by providing a usable and effective mechanism for protecting
sensitive gaze data.

### [2] [A Survey on Video Temporal Grounding with Multimodal Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10922)
*Jianlong Wu,Wei Liu,Ye Liu,Meng Liu,Liqiang Nie,Zhouchen Lin,Chang Wen Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文综述了基于多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的视频时间定位（VTG）研究，通过三维分类法系统分析了当前研究，并讨论了数据集、评估方法和未来方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 填补VTG-MLLMs领域缺乏全面综述的空白，推动该领域的发展。

Method: 采用三维分类法：1) MLLMs的功能角色；2) 训练范式；3) 视频特征处理技术。

Result: 总结了当前研究的经验发现，并提出了现有局限性和未来研究方向。

Conclusion: VTG-MLLMs在性能和多任务泛化方面表现优异，但仍需进一步研究以克服局限性。

Abstract: The recent advancement in video temporal grounding (VTG) has significantly
enhanced fine-grained video understanding, primarily driven by multimodal large
language models (MLLMs). With superior multimodal comprehension and reasoning
abilities, VTG approaches based on MLLMs (VTG-MLLMs) are gradually surpassing
traditional fine-tuned methods. They not only achieve competitive performance
but also excel in generalization across zero-shot, multi-task, and multi-domain
settings. Despite extensive surveys on general video-language understanding,
comprehensive reviews specifically addressing VTG-MLLMs remain scarce. To fill
this gap, this survey systematically examines current research on VTG-MLLMs
through a three-dimensional taxonomy: 1) the functional roles of MLLMs,
highlighting their architectural significance; 2) training paradigms, analyzing
strategies for temporal reasoning and task adaptation; and 3) video feature
processing techniques, which determine spatiotemporal representation
effectiveness. We further discuss benchmark datasets, evaluation protocols, and
summarize empirical findings. Finally, we identify existing limitations and
propose promising research directions. For additional resources and details,

### [3] [VSF: Simple, Efficient, and Effective Negative Guidance in Few-Step Image Generation Models By \underline{V}alue \underline{S}ign \underline{F}lip](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10931)
*Wenqi Guo,Shan Du*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VSF是一种通过翻转负提示的注意力值符号来动态抑制不需要内容的方法，适用于少步扩散和流匹配图像生成模型，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如CFG、NASA、NAG）在负提示引导方面存在不足，VSF旨在通过简单高效的方式提升负提示的遵循能力。

Method: VSF通过翻转负提示的注意力值符号动态抑制不需要的内容，计算开销小，适用于多种架构（如Stable Diffusion 3.5 Turbo、Wan）。

Result: 实验表明，VSF在少步和非少步模型中均显著提升负提示遵循能力，同时保持图像质量。

Conclusion: VSF是一种高效且性能优越的负提示引导方法，适用于多种图像生成任务。

Abstract: We introduce Value Sign Flip (VSF), a simple and efficient method for
incorporating negative prompt guidance in few-step diffusion and flow-matching
image generation models. Unlike existing approaches such as classifier-free
guidance (CFG), NASA, and NAG, VSF dynamically suppresses undesired content by
flipping the sign of attention values from negative prompts. Our method
requires only small computational overhead and integrates effectively with
MMDiT-style architectures such as Stable Diffusion 3.5 Turbo, as well as
cross-attention-based models like Wan. We validate VSF on challenging datasets
with complex prompt pairs and demonstrate superior performance in both static
image and video generation tasks. Experimental results show that VSF
significantly improves negative prompt adherence compared to prior methods in
few-step models, and even CFG in non-few-step models, while maintaining
competitive image quality. Code and ComfyUI node are available in

### [4] [ViPE: Video Pose Engine for 3D Geometric Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10934)
*Jiahui Huang,Qunjie Zhou,Hesam Rabeti,Aleksandr Korovko,Huan Ling,Xuanchi Ren,Tianchang Shen,Jun Gao,Dmitry Slepichev,Chen-Hsuan Lin,Jiawei Ren,Kevin Xie,Joydeep Biswas,Laura Leal-Taixe,Sanja Fidler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViPE是一种高效视频处理引擎，用于从非约束视频中估计相机参数和深度图，显著优于现有基线，并支持多种场景和相机模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D几何感知方法依赖大规模训练数据，但获取精确的3D标注仍具挑战性。ViPE旨在填补这一空白。

Method: ViPE通过处理非约束视频，估计相机内参、运动和密集深度图，适用于多种场景和相机模型。

Result: ViPE在TUM/KITTI序列上比现有基线提升18%/50%，并在单GPU上以3-5FPS运行。

Conclusion: ViPE及其标注的大规模数据集开源，有望推动空间AI系统的发展。

Abstract: Accurate 3D geometric perception is an important prerequisite for a wide
range of spatial AI systems. While state-of-the-art methods depend on
large-scale training data, acquiring consistent and precise 3D annotations from
in-the-wild videos remains a key challenge. In this work, we introduce ViPE, a
handy and versatile video processing engine designed to bridge this gap. ViPE
efficiently estimates camera intrinsics, camera motion, and dense, near-metric
depth maps from unconstrained raw videos. It is robust to diverse scenarios,
including dynamic selfie videos, cinematic shots, or dashcams, and supports
various camera models such as pinhole, wide-angle, and 360{\deg} panoramas. We
have benchmarked ViPE on multiple benchmarks. Notably, it outperforms existing
uncalibrated pose estimation baselines by 18%/50% on TUM/KITTI sequences, and
runs at 3-5FPS on a single GPU for standard input resolutions. We use ViPE to
annotate a large-scale collection of videos. This collection includes around
100K real-world internet videos, 1M high-quality AI-generated videos, and 2K
panoramic videos, totaling approximately 96M frames -- all annotated with
accurate camera poses and dense depth maps. We open-source ViPE and the
annotated dataset with the hope of accelerating the development of spatial AI
systems.

### [5] [Relative Pose Regression with Pose Auto-Encoders: Enhancing Accuracy and Data Efficiency for Retail Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10933)
*Yoli Shavit,Yosi Keller*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于相机姿态自动编码器（PAE）的相对姿态回归（RPR）方法，用于改进单图像绝对姿态回归（APR）的定位精度，无需额外存储图像或姿态数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代零售环境中，精确的相机定位对提升客户体验、优化库存管理和实现自主操作至关重要。现有APR方法虽有效，但结合视觉和空间场景先验的方法精度更高。

Method: 扩展PAE至RPR任务，提出一种新的重定位方案，利用PAE-based RPR优化APR预测，无需额外数据存储。

Result: 实验表明，PAE-based RPR优于等效架构的图像RPR模型，且仅需30%数据即可达到竞争性能，显著降低数据收集负担。

Conclusion: 该方法在室内基准测试中提升了APR定位精度，为零售部署提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate camera localization is crucial for modern retail environments,
enabling enhanced customer experiences, streamlined inventory management, and
autonomous operations. While Absolute Pose Regression (APR) from a single image
offers a promising solution, approaches that incorporate visual and spatial
scene priors tend to achieve higher accuracy. Camera Pose Auto-Encoders (PAEs)
have recently been introduced to embed such priors into APR. In this work, we
extend PAEs to the task of Relative Pose Regression (RPR) and propose a novel
re-localization scheme that refines APR predictions using PAE-based RPR,
without requiring additional storage of images or pose data. We first introduce
PAE-based RPR and establish its effectiveness by comparing it with image-based
RPR models of equivalent architectures. We then demonstrate that our refinement
strategy, driven by a PAE-based RPR, enhances APR localization accuracy on
indoor benchmarks. Notably, our method is shown to achieve competitive
performance even when trained with only 30% of the data, substantially reducing
the data collection burden for retail deployment. Our code and pre-trained
models are available at: https://github.com/yolish/camera-pose-auto-encoders

### [6] [HQ-OV3D: A High Box Quality Open-World 3D Detection Framework based on Diffision Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10935)
*Qi Liu,Yabei Li,Hongsong Wang,Lei He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出HQ-OV3D框架，通过高质量伪标签生成和优化，提升开放词汇3D检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统封闭式3D检测无法满足开放世界应用需求，现有开放词汇方法忽视几何质量。

Method: 提出IMCV提案生成器和ACA去噪器，利用跨模态几何一致性和标注类几何先验优化伪标签。

Result: 在新型类上mAP提升7.37%，伪标签质量显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HQ-OV3D可作为独立检测器或插件，提升现有开放词汇检测流程的伪标签质量。

Abstract: Traditional closed-set 3D detection frameworks fail to meet the demands of
open-world applications like autonomous driving. Existing open-vocabulary 3D
detection methods typically adopt a two-stage pipeline consisting of
pseudo-label generation followed by semantic alignment. While vision-language
models (VLMs) recently have dramatically improved the semantic accuracy of
pseudo-labels, their geometric quality, particularly bounding box precision,
remains commonly neglected.To address this issue, we propose a High Box Quality
Open-Vocabulary 3D Detection (HQ-OV3D) framework, dedicated to generate and
refine high-quality pseudo-labels for open-vocabulary classes. The framework
comprises two key components: an Intra-Modality Cross-Validated (IMCV) Proposal
Generator that utilizes cross-modality geometric consistency to generate
high-quality initial 3D proposals, and an Annotated-Class Assisted (ACA)
Denoiser that progressively refines 3D proposals by leveraging geometric priors
from annotated categories through a DDIM-based denoising mechanism.Compared to
the state-of-the-art method, training with pseudo-labels generated by our
approach achieves a 7.37% improvement in mAP on novel classes, demonstrating
the superior quality of the pseudo-labels produced by our framework. HQ-OV3D
can serve not only as a strong standalone open-vocabulary 3D detector but also
as a plug-in high-quality pseudo-label generator for existing open-vocabulary
detection or annotation pipelines.

### [7] [Vision-Only Gaussian Splatting for Collaborative Semantic Occupancy Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10936)
*Cheng Chen,Hao Huang,Saurabh Bagchi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于稀疏3D语义高斯泼溅的协作3D语义占用预测方法，显著提升了性能并降低了通信成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有视觉方法在协作场景中因高通信成本或依赖深度估计而受限的问题。

Method: 通过共享和融合中间高斯基元，实现跨代理融合、几何与语义联合编码及稀疏通信。

Result: 在mIoU和IoU上分别优于单代理和基线协作方法，通信量减少至34.6%时仍保持性能提升。

Conclusion: 该方法在协作感知中表现出高效性和鲁棒性，适用于通信资源有限的场景。

Abstract: Collaborative perception enables connected vehicles to share information,
overcoming occlusions and extending the limited sensing range inherent in
single-agent (non-collaborative) systems. Existing vision-only methods for 3D
semantic occupancy prediction commonly rely on dense 3D voxels, which incur
high communication costs, or 2D planar features, which require accurate depth
estimation or additional supervision, limiting their applicability to
collaborative scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose the first
approach leveraging sparse 3D semantic Gaussian splatting for collaborative 3D
semantic occupancy prediction. By sharing and fusing intermediate Gaussian
primitives, our method provides three benefits: a neighborhood-based
cross-agent fusion that removes duplicates and suppresses noisy or inconsistent
Gaussians; a joint encoding of geometry and semantics in each primitive, which
reduces reliance on depth supervision and allows simple rigid alignment; and
sparse, object-centric messages that preserve structural information while
reducing communication volume. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach outperforms single-agent perception and baseline collaborative methods
by +8.42 and +3.28 points in mIoU, and +5.11 and +22.41 points in IoU,
respectively. When further reducing the number of transmitted Gaussians, our
method still achieves a +1.9 improvement in mIoU, using only 34.6%
communication volume, highlighting robust performance under limited
communication budgets.

### [8] [Personalized Face Super-Resolution with Identity Decoupling and Fitting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10937)
*Jiarui Yang,Hang Guo,Wen Huang,Tao Dai,Shutao Xia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的面部超分辨率方法IDFSR，通过身份解耦和拟合，解决了极端退化场景下身份信息丢失和幻觉效应的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在极端退化场景（如放大倍数>8倍）下，传统方法难以重建真实且身份一致的面部图像，导致生成的图像缺乏真实的身份约束。

Method: IDFSR采用三种关键设计：1）掩蔽低分辨率图像中的面部区域；2）对齐参考图像以提供风格指导；3）利用真实图像的ID嵌入进行细粒度建模和个性化适配。

Result: 实验表明，IDFSR在极端退化条件下显著优于现有方法，尤其是在身份一致性方面表现优异。

Conclusion: IDFSR通过身份解耦和拟合，有效提升了极端退化场景下的身份恢复能力，同时减少了幻觉效应。

Abstract: In recent years, face super-resolution (FSR) methods have achieved remarkable
progress, generally maintaining high image fidelity and identity (ID)
consistency under standard settings. However, in extreme degradation scenarios
(e.g., scale $> 8\times$), critical attributes and ID information are often
severely lost in the input image, making it difficult for conventional models
to reconstruct realistic and ID-consistent faces. Existing methods tend to
generate hallucinated faces under such conditions, producing restored images
lacking authentic ID constraints. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
FSR method with Identity Decoupling and Fitting (IDFSR), designed to enhance ID
restoration under large scaling factors while mitigating hallucination effects.
Our approach involves three key designs: 1) \textbf{Masking} the facial region
in the low-resolution (LR) image to eliminate unreliable ID cues; 2)
\textbf{Warping} a reference image to align with the LR input, providing style
guidance; 3) Leveraging \textbf{ID embeddings} extracted from ground truth (GT)
images for fine-grained ID modeling and personalized adaptation. We first
pretrain a diffusion-based model to explicitly decouple style and ID by forcing
it to reconstruct masked LR face regions using both style and identity
embeddings. Subsequently, we freeze most network parameters and perform
lightweight fine-tuning of the ID embedding using a small set of target ID
images. This embedding encodes fine-grained facial attributes and precise ID
information, significantly improving both ID consistency and perceptual
quality. Extensive quantitative evaluations and visual comparisons demonstrate
that the proposed IDFSR substantially outperforms existing approaches under
extreme degradation, particularly achieving superior performance on ID
consistency.

Abstract: Accurate identification of wood species plays a critical role in ecological
monitoring, biodiversity conservation, and sustainable forest management.
Traditional classification approaches relying on macroscopic and microscopic
inspection are labor-intensive and require expert knowledge. In this study, we
explore the application of deep learning to automate the classification of ten
wood species commonly found in Vietnam. A custom image dataset was constructed
from field-collected wood samples, and five state-of-the-art convolutional
neural network architectures--ResNet50, EfficientNet, MobileViT, MobileNetV3,
and ShuffleNetV2--were evaluated. Among these, ShuffleNetV2 achieved the best
balance between classification performance and computational efficiency, with
an average accuracy of 99.29\% and F1-score of 99.35\% over 20 independent
runs. These results demonstrate the potential of lightweight deep learning
models for real-time, high-accuracy species identification in
resource-constrained environments. Our work contributes to the growing field of
ecological informatics by providing scalable, image-based solutions for
automated wood classification and forest biodiversity assessment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升卷积神经网络在图像分类任务中的特征表达能力和鲁棒性。

Method: 动态调整池化参数，结合ReLU激活函数，形成NIRMAL Pooling层。

Result: 在MNIST Digits、MNIST Fashion和CIFAR-10数据集上，NIRMAL Pooling的准确率均优于传统最大池化。

Conclusion: NIRMAL Pooling是一种灵活可靠的池化方法，可显著提升CNN在复杂图像任务中的性能。

Abstract: This paper presents NIRMAL Pooling, a novel pooling layer for Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs) that integrates adaptive max pooling with non-linear
activation function for image classification tasks. The acronym NIRMAL stands
for Non-linear Activation, Intermediate Aggregation, Reduction, Maximum,
Adaptive, and Localized. By dynamically adjusting pooling parameters based on
desired output dimensions and applying a Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU)
activation post-pooling, NIRMAL Pooling improves robustness and feature
expressiveness. We evaluated its performance against standard Max Pooling on
three benchmark datasets: MNIST Digits, MNIST Fashion, and CIFAR-10. NIRMAL
Pooling achieves test accuracies of 99.25% (vs. 99.12% for Max Pooling) on
MNIST Digits, 91.59% (vs. 91.44%) on MNIST Fashion, and 70.49% (vs. 68.87%) on
CIFAR-10, demonstrating consistent improvements, particularly on complex
datasets. This work highlights the potential of NIRMAL Pooling to enhance CNN
performance in diverse image recognition tasks, offering a flexible and
reliable alternative to traditional pooling methods.

### [11] [Topological Structure Description for Artcode Detection Using the Shape of Orientation Histogram](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10942)
*Liming Xu,Dave Towey,Andrew P. French,Steve Benford*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文研究了Artcodes的检测问题，提出了一种新的特征描述符（形状方向直方图）用于识别拓扑结构，并通过实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着智能手机和VR/AR技术的普及，环境中虚拟与现实结合的物体增多，识别这些物体（如Artcodes）是触发后续交互的第一步。

Method: 提出了一种名为形状方向直方图的新特征描述符，用于描述Artcodes的拓扑结构，并构建了检测系统进行实验验证。

Result: 实验结果表明，该特征描述符能有效表示拓扑结构，检测系统在Artcode识别上表现良好。

Conclusion: 该研究为拓扑物体检测提供了初步解决方案，有望推动相关交互应用的发展。

Abstract: The increasing ubiquity of smartphones and resurgence of VR/AR techniques, it
is expected that our everyday environment may soon be decorating with objects
connecting with virtual elements. Alerting to the presence of these objects is
therefore the first step for motivating follow-up further inspection and
triggering digital material attached to the objects. This work studies a
special kind of these objects -- Artcodes -- a human-meaningful and
machine-readable decorative markers that camouflage themselves with freeform
appearance by encoding information into their topology. We formulate this
problem of recongising the presence of Artcodes as Artcode proposal detection,
a distinct computer vision task that classifies topologically similar but
geometrically and semantically different objects as a same class. To deal with
this problem, we propose a new feature descriptor, called the shape of
orientation histogram, to describe the generic topological structure of an
Artcode. We collect datasets and conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate
the performance of the Artcode detection proposer built upon this new feature
vector. Our experimental results show the feasibility of the proposed feature
vector for representing topological structures and the effectiveness of the
system for detecting Artcode proposals. Although this work is an initial
attempt to develop a feature-based system for detecting topological objects
like Artcodes, it would open up new interaction opportunities and spark
potential applications of topological object detection.

*Christian Düreth,Jan Condé-Wolter,Marek Danczak,Karsten Tittmann,Jörn Jaschinski,Andreas Hornig,Maik Gude*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种量化干纺织增强材料中嵌套行为的框架，使用低分辨率CT扫描和3D-UNet模型进行语义分割，并通过两点相关函数分析空间结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解纺织增强复合材料的多尺度结构对预测其机械性能至关重要，嵌套行为直接影响材料的刚度、渗透性和损伤耐受性。

Method: 采用低分辨率CT扫描进行原位压实实验，利用3D-UNet模型对材料各相进行语义分割，并通过两点相关函数分析空间结构。

Result: 模型分割性能优异（IoU为0.822，F1分数为0.902），分析结果与显微图像验证一致，成功提取了平均层厚度和嵌套度。

Conclusion: 该方法为从工业CT数据中提取关键几何特征提供了可靠途径，并为复合材料预成型体的逆向建模和基于描述符的结构分析奠定了基础。

Abstract: A detailed understanding of material structure across multiple scales is
essential for predictive modeling of textile-reinforced composites. Nesting --
characterized by the interlocking of adjacent fabric layers through local
interpenetration and misalignment of yarns -- plays a critical role in defining
mechanical properties such as stiffness, permeability, and damage tolerance.
This study presents a framework to quantify nesting behavior in dry textile
reinforcements under compaction using low-resolution computed tomography (CT).
In-situ compaction experiments were conducted on various stacking
configurations, with CT scans acquired at 20.22 $\mu$m per voxel resolution. A
tailored 3D{-}UNet enabled semantic segmentation of matrix, weft, and fill
phases across compaction stages corresponding to fiber volume contents of
50--60 %. The model achieved a minimum mean Intersection-over-Union of 0.822
and an $F1$ score of 0.902. Spatial structure was subsequently analyzed using
the two-point correlation function $S_2$, allowing for probabilistic extraction
of average layer thickness and nesting degree. The results show strong
agreement with micrograph-based validation. This methodology provides a robust
approach for extracting key geometrical features from industrially relevant CT
data and establishes a foundation for reverse modeling and descriptor-based
structural analysis of composite preforms.

Abstract: Potholes on the roads are a serious hazard and maintenance burden. This poses
a significant threat to road safety and vehicle longevity, especially on the
diverse and under-maintained roads of India. In this paper, we present a
complete end-to-end system called iWatchRoad for automated pothole detection,
Global Positioning System (GPS) tagging, and real time mapping using
OpenStreetMap (OSM). We curated a large, self-annotated dataset of over 7,000
frames captured across various road types, lighting conditions, and weather
scenarios unique to Indian environments, leveraging dashcam footage. This
dataset is used to fine-tune, Ultralytics You Only Look Once (YOLO) model to
perform real time pothole detection, while a custom Optical Character
Recognition (OCR) module was employed to extract timestamps directly from video
frames. The timestamps are synchronized with GPS logs to geotag each detected
potholes accurately. The processed data includes the potholes' details and
frames as metadata is stored in a database and visualized via a user friendly
web interface using OSM. iWatchRoad not only improves detection accuracy under
challenging conditions but also provides government compatible outputs for road
assessment and maintenance planning through the metadata visible on the
website. Our solution is cost effective, hardware efficient, and scalable,
offering a practical tool for urban and rural road management in developing
regions, making the system automated. iWatchRoad is available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为增量补丁生成（IPG）的方法，能高效生成对抗性补丁，比现有方法快11.1倍，同时保持攻击性能。实验证明IPG能生成泛化性强的补丁，覆盖更广的模型漏洞，并可用于构建鲁棒模型。

Motivation: 对抗性补丁对AI模型的鲁棒性构成挑战，尤其在计算机视觉任务中。传统对抗样本仅针对图像局部区域，导致模型失效。

Method: 提出增量补丁生成（IPG）方法，通过实验和消融研究（如YOLO特征分布可视化）验证其高效性和泛化性。

Result: IPG生成补丁的效率比现有方法高11.1倍，且能覆盖更广的模型漏洞，生成的补丁数据集可用于构建鲁棒模型。

Conclusion: IPG在对抗性补丁防御和实际应用（如自动驾驶、医疗影像）中具有潜力，能提升AI模型在高风险环境中的鲁棒性。

Abstract: The advent of adversarial patches poses a significant challenge to the
robustness of AI models, particularly in the domain of computer vision tasks
such as object detection. In contradistinction to traditional adversarial
examples, these patches target specific regions of an image, resulting in the
malfunction of AI models. This paper proposes Incremental Patch Generation
(IPG), a method that generates adversarial patches up to 11.1 times more
efficiently than existing approaches while maintaining comparable attack
performance. The efficacy of IPG is demonstrated by experiments and ablation
studies including YOLO's feature distribution visualization and adversarial
training results, which show that it produces well-generalized patches that
effectively cover a broader range of model vulnerabilities. Furthermore,
IPG-generated datasets can serve as a robust knowledge foundation for
constructing a robust model, enabling structured representation, advanced
reasoning, and proactive defenses in AI security ecosystems. The findings of
this study suggest that IPG has considerable potential for future utilization
not only in adversarial patch defense but also in real-world applications such
as autonomous vehicles, security systems, and medical imaging, where AI models
must remain resilient to adversarial attacks in dynamic and high-stakes
environments.

TL;DR: MedAtlas是一个新的医学基准框架，旨在评估大语言模型在真实医学推理任务中的表现，支持多轮对话、多模态图像交互和多任务集成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学多模态基准局限于单图像、单轮任务，无法反映临床实践中的多模态交互和纵向特性。

Method: MedAtlas引入多轮对话、多模态图像交互、多任务集成和高临床保真度，支持四种核心任务，并基于真实诊断流程设计案例。

Result: 现有多模态模型在多阶段临床推理中表现不佳，MedAtlas提供了具有挑战性的评估平台。

Conclusion: MedAtlas为开发稳健可信的医学AI提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has demonstrated significant potential in clinical
decision-making; however, developing models capable of adapting to diverse
real-world scenarios and performing complex diagnostic reasoning remains a
major challenge. Existing medical multi-modal benchmarks are typically limited
to single-image, single-turn tasks, lacking multi-modal medical image
integration and failing to capture the longitudinal and multi-modal interactive
nature inherent to clinical practice. To address this gap, we introduce
MedAtlas, a novel benchmark framework designed to evaluate large language
models on realistic medical reasoning tasks. MedAtlas is characterized by four
key features: multi-turn dialogue, multi-modal medical image interaction,
multi-task integration, and high clinical fidelity. It supports four core
tasks: open-ended multi-turn question answering, closed-ended multi-turn
question answering, multi-image joint reasoning, and comprehensive disease
diagnosis. Each case is derived from real diagnostic workflows and incorporates
temporal interactions between textual medical histories and multiple imaging
modalities, including CT, MRI, PET, ultrasound, and X-ray, requiring models to
perform deep integrative reasoning across images and clinical texts. MedAtlas
provides expert-annotated gold standards for all tasks. Furthermore, we propose
two novel evaluation metrics: Round Chain Accuracy and Error Propagation
Resistance. Benchmark results with existing multi-modal models reveal
substantial performance gaps in multi-stage clinical reasoning. MedAtlas
establishes a challenging evaluation platform to advance the development of
robust and trustworthy medical AI.

TL;DR: FastFOD-Net是一种基于深度学习的FOD增强框架，显著提升了临床扩散MRI数据的分析效率和准确性，适用于多种神经系统疾病研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决临床单壳低角度分辨率MRI数据生成可靠FOD的挑战，并验证深度学习增强技术的临床适用性。

Method: 开发了FastFOD-Net，一种加速的端到端深度学习框架，用于增强FOD，并在健康对照和六种神经系统疾病中验证其性能。

Result: FastFOD-Net在性能上优于前代方法（快60倍），并展示了在疾病区分、连接组分析和减少测量误差方面的潜力。

Conclusion: FastFOD-Net有望加速临床神经科学研究，增强对深度学习方法的信任，并推动其在扩散MRI分析中的广泛应用。

Abstract: Fiber orientation distribution (FOD) is an advanced diffusion MRI modeling
technique that represents complex white matter fiber configurations, and a key
step for subsequent brain tractography and connectome analysis. Its reliability
and accuracy, however, heavily rely on the quality of the MRI acquisition and
the subsequent estimation of the FODs at each voxel. Generating reliable FODs
from widely available clinical protocols with single-shell and
low-angular-resolution acquisitions remains challenging but could potentially
be addressed with recent advances in deep learning-based enhancement
techniques. Despite advancements, existing methods have predominantly been
assessed on healthy subjects, which have proved to be a major hurdle for their
clinical adoption. In this work, we validate a newly optimized enhancement
framework, FastFOD-Net, across healthy controls and six neurological disorders.
This accelerated end-to-end deep learning framework enhancing FODs with
superior performance and delivering training/inference efficiency for clinical
use ($60\times$ faster comparing to its predecessor). With the most
comprehensive clinical evaluation to date, our work demonstrates the potential
of FastFOD-Net in accelerating clinical neuroscience research, empowering
diffusion MRI analysis for disease differentiation, improving interpretability
in connectome applications, and reducing measurement errors to lower sample
size requirements. Critically, this work will facilitate the more widespread
adoption of, and build clinical trust in, deep learning based methods for
diffusion MRI enhancement. Specifically, FastFOD-Net enables robust analysis of
real-world, clinical diffusion MRI data, comparable to that achievable with
high-quality research acquisitions.

TL;DR: 本文综述了如何通过外部工具增强多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的性能，涵盖数据获取、任务性能提升、评估方法及未来方向。


<details>

Motivation: 尽管MLLMs在多模态任务中表现优异，但数据质量、复杂任务表现和评估协议的不足限制了其可靠性和广泛应用。受人类利用外部工具解决问题的启发，本文探讨如何通过外部工具解决这些问题。

Method: 通过四个关键维度分析外部工具的作用：高质量数据获取与标注、复杂任务性能提升、全面评估方法，以及当前局限与未来方向。

Result: 外部工具在提升MLLMs的数据质量、任务表现和评估准确性方面具有潜力。

Conclusion: 外部工具对MLLMs的发展具有变革性潜力，未来需进一步探索其应用与优化。

Abstract: By integrating the perception capabilities of multimodal encoders with the
generative power of Large Language Models (LLMs), Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs), exemplified by GPT-4V, have achieved great success in various
multimodal tasks, pointing toward a promising pathway to artificial general
intelligence. Despite this progress, the limited quality of multimodal data,
poor performance on many complex downstream tasks, and inadequate evaluation
protocols continue to hinder the reliability and broader applicability of MLLMs
across diverse domains. Inspired by the human ability to leverage external
tools for enhanced reasoning and problem-solving, augmenting MLLMs with
external tools (e.g., APIs, expert models, and knowledge bases) offers a
promising strategy to overcome these challenges. In this paper, we present a
comprehensive survey on leveraging external tools to enhance MLLM performance.
Our discussion is structured along four key dimensions about external tools:
(1) how they can facilitate the acquisition and annotation of high-quality
multimodal data; (2) how they can assist in improving MLLM performance on
challenging downstream tasks; (3) how they enable comprehensive and accurate
evaluation of MLLMs; (4) the current limitations and future directions of
tool-augmented MLLMs. Through this survey, we aim to underscore the
transformative potential of external tools in advancing MLLM capabilities,
offering a forward-looking perspective on their development and applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了ORBIT，一个多层次的视觉问答基准测试，用于评估视觉语言模型在对象属性推理上的表现，发现现有模型在复杂推理和真实图像上表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉问答基准测试在对象属性推理上存在局限性，缺乏代表性和复杂性，无法全面评估模型的抽象和推理能力。

Method: 通过设计包含三种图像类型、三个推理层次和四个对象属性维度的系统评估框架，构建ORBIT基准测试，包含360张图像和1,080个问题。

Result: 在零样本设置下，12个先进视觉语言模型表现显著低于人类，最佳模型准确率仅40%，尤其在真实图像和复杂推理上表现较差。

Conclusion: ORBIT揭示了现有模型的局限性，呼吁开发更可扩展的基准测试方法和更强的推理模型，以推动领域发展。

Abstract: While vision-language models (VLMs) have made remarkable progress on many
popular visual question answering (VQA) benchmarks, it remains unclear whether
they abstract and reason over depicted objects. Inspired by human object
categorisation, object property reasoning involves identifying and recognising
low-level details and higher-level abstractions. While current VQA benchmarks
consider a limited set of object property attributes like size, they typically
blend perception and reasoning, and lack representativeness in terms of
reasoning and image categories. To this end, we introduce a systematic
evaluation framework with images of three representative types, three reasoning
levels of increasing complexity, and four object property dimensions driven by
prior work on commonsense reasoning. We develop a procedure to instantiate this
benchmark into ORBIT, a multi-level reasoning VQA benchmark for object
properties comprising 360 images paired with a total of 1,080 count-based
questions. Experiments with 12 state-of-the-art VLMs in zero-shot settings
reveal significant limitations compared to humans, with the best-performing
model only reaching 40\% accuracy. VLMs struggle particularly with realistic
(photographic) images, counterfactual reasoning about physical and functional
properties, and higher counts. ORBIT points to the need to develop methods for
scalable benchmarking, generalize annotation guidelines, and explore additional
reasoning VLMs. We make the ORBIT benchmark and the experimental code available
to support such endeavors.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于高光谱成像（HSI）的方法，通过选择信息量最大的波段来减少视觉模糊性，从而提高对弱势道路使用者（VRU）的识别能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决汽车感知系统在RGB图像中因同色异谱现象导致的视觉模糊问题，提升对VRU的识别安全性。

Method: 结合信息论技术（联合互信息最大化、相关性分析）和图像质量指标（对比信噪比），选择最具信息量的HSI波段，并重建伪彩色图像。

Result: 在H-City数据集上，选定的HSI波段（497 nm、607 nm、895 nm）显著提高了VRU与背景的差异性和可分离性，各项指标提升显著。

Conclusion: 该方法通过优化光谱输入，有效减少了同色异谱混淆，为ADAS和自动驾驶中的感知任务提供了更可靠的基础，提升了道路安全性。

Abstract: Protecting Vulnerable Road Users (VRU) is a critical safety challenge for
automotive perception systems, particularly under visual ambiguity caused by
metamerism, a phenomenon where distinct materials appear similar in RGB
imagery. This work investigates hyperspectral imaging (HSI) to overcome this
limitation by capturing unique material signatures beyond the visible spectrum,
especially in the Near-Infrared (NIR). To manage the inherent
high-dimensionality of HSI data, we propose a band selection strategy that
integrates information theory techniques (joint mutual information
maximization, correlation analysis) with a novel application of an image
quality metric (contrast signal-to-noise ratio) to identify the most spectrally
informative bands. Using the Hyperspectral City V2 (H-City) dataset, we
identify three informative bands (497 nm, 607 nm, and 895 nm, $\pm$27 nm) and
reconstruct pseudo-color images for comparison with co-registered RGB.
Quantitative results demonstrate increased dissimilarity and perceptual
separability of VRU from the background. The selected HSI bands yield
improvements of 70.24%, 528.46%, 1206.83%, and 246.62% for dissimilarity
(Euclidean, SAM, $T^2$) and perception (CIE $\Delta E$) metrics, consistently
outperforming RGB and confirming a marked reduction in metameric confusion. By
providing a spectrally optimized input, our method enhances VRU separability,
establishing a robust foundation for downstream perception tasks in Advanced
Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Autonomous Driving (AD), ultimately
contributing to improved road safety.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出EVCtrl，一种轻量级即插即用的控制适配器，通过时空双缓存策略减少冗余计算，提升生成效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ControlNet在视频生成中因冗余计算导致延迟高，需解决这一问题。

Method: 提出时空双缓存策略：空间上分区处理，时间上选择性跳过去噪步骤。

Result: 在多个数据集上实现2倍以上加速，生成质量几乎无损。

Conclusion: EVCtrl高效且无需重新训练，适用于图像和视频生成。

Abstract: Visual generation includes both image and video generation, training
probabilistic models to create coherent, diverse, and semantically faithful
content from scratch. While early research focused on unconditional sampling,
practitioners now demand controllable generation that allows precise
specification of layout, pose, motion, or style. While ControlNet grants
precise spatial-temporal control, its auxiliary branch markedly increases
latency and introduces redundant computation in both uncontrolled regions and
denoising steps, especially for video. To address this problem, we introduce
EVCtrl, a lightweight, plug-and-play control adapter that slashes overhead
without retraining the model. Specifically, we propose a spatio-temporal dual
caching strategy for sparse control information. For spatial redundancy, we
first profile how each layer of DiT-ControlNet responds to fine-grained
control, then partition the network into global and local functional zones. A
locality-aware cache focuses computation on the local zones that truly need the
control signal, skipping the bulk of redundant computation in global regions.
For temporal redundancy, we selectively omit unnecessary denoising steps to
improve efficiency. Extensive experiments on CogVideo-Controlnet,
Wan2.1-Controlnet, and Flux demonstrate that our method is effective in image
and video control generation without the need for training. For example, it
achieves 2.16 and 2.05 times speedups on CogVideo-Controlnet and
Wan2.1-Controlnet, respectively, with almost no degradation in generation
quality.Codes are available in the supplementary materials.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探索VLMs在无障碍领域的模拟能力，填补了此前研究的空白。

Method: 通过调查40名低视力参与者构建数据集，生成模拟代理，并评估VLM生成答案与原始答案的一致性。

Result: 结果显示，结合视觉信息和示例图像响应能显著提高一致性（0.70），而单独提供任一部分效果较差（0.59）。

Conclusion: 结论表明，VLMs在模拟低视力人群时需要结合多模态信息，但额外示例的收益有限。

Abstract: Advances in vision language models (VLMs) have enabled the simulation of
general human behavior through their reasoning and problem solving
capabilities. However, prior research has not investigated such simulation
capabilities in the accessibility domain. In this paper, we evaluate the extent
to which VLMs can simulate the vision perception of low vision individuals when
interpreting images. We first compile a benchmark dataset through a survey
study with 40 low vision participants, collecting their brief and detailed
vision information and both open-ended and multiple-choice image perception and
recognition responses to up to 25 images. Using these responses, we construct
prompts for VLMs (GPT-4o) to create simulated agents of each participant,
varying the included information on vision information and example image
responses. We evaluate the agreement between VLM-generated responses and
participants' original answers. Our results indicate that VLMs tend to infer
beyond the specified vision ability when given minimal prompts, resulting in
low agreement (0.59). The agreement between the agent' and participants'
responses remains low when only either the vision information (0.59) or example
image responses (0.59) are provided, whereas a combination of both
significantly increase the agreement (0.70, p < 0.0001). Notably, a single
example combining both open-ended and multiple-choice responses, offers
significant performance improvements over either alone (p < 0.0001), while
additional examples provided minimal benefits (p > 0.05).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有建筑安全检查依赖人工，且缺乏开放数据集评估VLMs的能力，限制了其实际应用。

Method: 构建包含图像标注、安全违规VQA和建筑元素视觉定位的数据集，并评估现有VLMs的泛化能力。

Result: 现有VLMs在零样本和少样本设置中表现良好，但需进一步训练以适应实际工地场景。

Conclusion: ConstructionSite 10k为研究人员提供了训练和评估VLMs的基准，推动建筑安全检查技术的发展。

Abstract: Construction safety inspections typically involve a human inspector
identifying safety concerns on-site. With the rise of powerful Vision Language
Models (VLMs), researchers are exploring their use for tasks such as detecting
safety rule violations from on-site images. However, there is a lack of open
datasets to comprehensively evaluate and further fine-tune VLMs in construction
safety inspection. Current applications of VLMs use small, supervised datasets,
limiting their applicability in tasks they are not directly trained for. In
this paper, we propose the ConstructionSite 10k, featuring 10,000 construction
site images with annotations for three inter-connected tasks, including image
captioning, safety rule violation visual question answering (VQA), and
construction element visual grounding. Our subsequent evaluation of current
state-of-the-art large pre-trained VLMs shows notable generalization abilities
in zero-shot and few-shot settings, while additional training is needed to make
them applicable to actual construction sites. This dataset allows researchers
to train and evaluate their own VLMs with new architectures and techniques,
providing a valuable benchmark for construction safety inspection.

Abstract: Document fraud poses a significant threat to industries reliant on secure and
verifiable documentation, necessitating robust detection mechanisms. This study
investigates the efficacy of state-of-the-art multi-modal large language models
(LLMs)-including OpenAI O1, OpenAI 4o, Gemini Flash (thinking), Deepseek Janus,
Grok, Llama 3.2 and 4, Qwen 2 and 2.5 VL, Mistral Pixtral, and Claude 3.5 and
3.7 Sonnet-in detecting fraudulent documents. We benchmark these models against
each other and prior work on document fraud detection techniques using a
standard dataset with real transactional documents. Through prompt optimization
and detailed analysis of the models' reasoning processes, we evaluate their
ability to identify subtle indicators of fraud, such as tampered text,
misaligned formatting, and inconsistent transactional sums. Our results reveal
that top-performing multi-modal LLMs demonstrate superior zero-shot
generalization, outperforming conventional methods on out-of-distribution
datasets, while several vision LLMs exhibit inconsistent or subpar performance.
Notably, model size and advanced reasoning capabilities show limited
correlation with detection accuracy, suggesting task-specific fine-tuning is
critical. This study underscores the potential of multi-modal LLMs in enhancing
document fraud detection systems and provides a foundation for future research
into interpretable and scalable fraud mitigation strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学图像分割模型（如MedSAM）因数据有限、标注稀缺和分布偏移等问题，泛化能力受限。

Method: 提出零阶优化方法自动发现最优层合并方案，并开发两种优化策略以满足不同临床需求。

Result: 在25个医学分割任务中，MedSAMix显著提升性能，专业任务和多任务评估分别提高6.67%和4.37%。

Conclusion: MedSAMix通过自动模型合并有效解决泛化和领域适应问题，为医学图像分割提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: Universal medical image segmentation models have emerged as a promising
paradigm due to their strong generalizability across diverse tasks, showing
great potential for a wide range of clinical applications. This potential has
been partly driven by the success of general-purpose vision models such as the
Segment Anything Model (SAM), which has inspired the development of various
fine-tuned variants for medical segmentation tasks. However, fine-tuned
variants like MedSAM are trained on comparatively limited medical imaging data
that often suffers from heterogeneity, scarce annotations, and distributional
shifts. These challenges limit their ability to generalize across a wide range
of medical segmentation tasks. In this regard, we propose MedSAMix, a
training-free model merging method that integrates the strengths of both
generalist models (e.g., SAM) and specialist models (e.g., MedSAM) for medical
image segmentation. In contrast to traditional model merging approaches that
rely on manual configuration and often result in suboptimal outcomes, we
propose a zero-order optimization method to automatically discover optimal
layer-wise merging solutions. Furthermore, for clinical applications, we
develop two regimes to meet the demand of domain-specificity and
generalizability in different scenarios by single-task optimization and
multi-objective optimization respectively. Extensive evaluations on 25 medical
segmentation tasks demonstrate that MedSAMix effectively mitigates model bias
and consistently improves performance in both domain-specific accuracy and
generalization, achieving improvements of 6.67% on specialized tasks and 4.37%
on multi-task evaluations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D视觉语言数据集在远距离对象和多视角推理方面存在不足，限制了模型的深度场景理解能力。

Method: 提出MV-ScanQA数据集测试多视角推理，TripAlign数据集提供2D-3D-语言预训练语料，并开发LEGO方法进行知识迁移。

Result: LEGO在MV-ScanQA和现有3D密集描述与问答基准上达到最优性能。

Conclusion: MV-ScanQA和TripAlign为3D视觉语言学习提供了更丰富的多对象和多视角对齐信号，推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: The advancement of 3D vision-language (3D VL) learning is hindered by several
limitations in existing 3D VL datasets: they rarely necessitate reasoning
beyond a close range of objects in single viewpoint, and annotations often link
instructions to single objects, missing richer contextual alignments between
multiple objects. This significantly curtails the development of models capable
of deep, multi-view 3D scene understanding over distant objects. To address
these challenges, we introduce MV-ScanQA, a novel 3D question answering dataset
where 68% of questions explicitly require integrating information from multiple
views (compared to less than 7% in existing datasets), thereby rigorously
testing multi-view compositional reasoning. To facilitate the training of
models for such demanding scenarios, we present TripAlign dataset, a
large-scale and low-cost 2D-3D-language pre-training corpus containing 1M <2D
view, set of 3D objects, text> triplets that explicitly aligns groups of
contextually related objects with text, providing richer, view-grounded
multi-object multimodal alignment signals than previous single-object
annotations. We further develop LEGO, a baseline method for the multi-view
reasoning challenge in MV-ScanQA, transferring knowledge from pre-trained 2D
LVLMs to 3D domain with TripAlign. Empirically, LEGO pre-trained on TripAlign
achieves state-of-the-art performance not only on the proposed MV-ScanQA, but
also on existing benchmarks for 3D dense captioning and question answering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管BMI是2型糖尿病的已知风险因素，但瘦人和肥胖人群中糖尿病的存在与缺失表明，详细的身体组成可能揭示腹部表型。

Method: 通过AI分析临床CT数据，使用随机森林和SHAP分析识别糖尿病风险和保护相关的腹部特征。

Result: 随机森林模型的AUC为0.72-0.74，发现脂肪肌肉、年龄、内脏和皮下脂肪、胰腺大小等是共同特征。

Conclusion: 腹部特征驱动的2型糖尿病风险在不同体重人群中可能一致。

Abstract: Purpose: Although elevated BMI is a well-known risk factor for type 2
diabetes, the disease's presence in some lean adults and absence in others with
obesity suggests that detailed body composition may uncover abdominal
phenotypes of type 2 diabetes. With AI, we can now extract detailed
measurements of size, shape, and fat content from abdominal structures in 3D
clinical imaging at scale. This creates an opportunity to empirically define
body composition signatures linked to type 2 diabetes risk and protection using
large-scale clinical data. Approach: To uncover BMI-specific diabetic abdominal
patterns from clinical CT, we applied our design four times: once on the full
cohort (n = 1,728) and once on lean (n = 497), overweight (n = 611), and obese
(n = 620) subgroups separately. Briefly, our experimental design transforms
abdominal scans into collections of explainable measurements through
segmentation, classifies type 2 diabetes through a cross-validated random
forest, measures how features contribute to model-estimated risk or protection
through SHAP analysis, groups scans by shared model decision patterns
(clustering from SHAP) and links back to anatomical differences
(classification). Results: The random-forests achieved mean AUCs of 0.72-0.74.
There were shared type 2 diabetes signatures in each group; fatty skeletal
muscle, older age, greater visceral and subcutaneous fat, and a smaller or
fat-laden pancreas. Univariate logistic regression confirmed the direction of
14-18 of the top 20 predictors within each subgroup (p < 0.05). Conclusions:
Our findings suggest that abdominal drivers of type 2 diabetes may be
consistent across weight classes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将3D对象视为整体，忽略了语义部分层次结构，且高分辨率建模计算成本高。HierOctFusion通过分层生成和部分感知机制解决了这些问题。

Method: 提出HierOctFusion模型，结合多尺度八叉树扩散和跨注意力机制，注入部分级信息，并构建带部分标注的3D数据集。

Result: 实验表明，HierOctFusion在形状质量和效率上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HierOctFusion通过分层和部分感知生成，显著提升了3D内容生成的性能。

Abstract: 3D content generation remains a fundamental yet challenging task due to the
inherent structural complexity of 3D data. While recent octree-based diffusion
models offer a promising balance between efficiency and quality through
hierarchical generation, they often overlook two key insights: 1) existing
methods typically model 3D objects as holistic entities, ignoring their
semantic part hierarchies and limiting generalization; and 2) holistic
high-resolution modeling is computationally expensive, whereas real-world
objects are inherently sparse and hierarchical, making them well-suited for
layered generation. Motivated by these observations, we propose HierOctFusion,
a part-aware multi-scale octree diffusion model that enhances hierarchical
feature interaction for generating fine-grained and sparse object structures.
Furthermore, we introduce a cross-attention conditioning mechanism that injects
part-level information into the generation process, enabling semantic features
to propagate effectively across hierarchical levels from parts to the whole.
Additionally, we construct a 3D dataset with part category annotations using a
pre-trained segmentation model to facilitate training and evaluation.
Experiments demonstrate that HierOctFusion achieves superior shape quality and
efficiency compared to prior methods.

*Bing Liu,Le Wang,Hao Liu,Mingming Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于残差的双向扩散模型（RBDM），实现雾图和去雾图之间的双向转换，仅需15步采样。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度去雾方法仅关注去雾，缺乏双向转换能力，RBDM旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 设计双马尔可夫链处理残差，通过扰动图像和预测噪声学习条件分布，并引入统一评分函数降低计算成本。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上表现优于或接近现有方法。

Conclusion: RBDM成功实现了雾图和去雾图之间的高效双向转换。

Abstract: Current deep dehazing methods only focus on removing haze from hazy images,
lacking the capability to translate between hazy and haze-free images. To
address this issue, we propose a residual-based efficient bidirectional
diffusion model (RBDM) that can model the conditional distributions for both
dehazing and haze generation. Firstly, we devise dual Markov chains that can
effectively shift the residuals and facilitate bidirectional smooth transitions
between them. Secondly, the RBDM perturbs the hazy and haze-free images at
individual timesteps and predicts the noise in the perturbed data to
simultaneously learn the conditional distributions. Finally, to enhance
performance on relatively small datasets and reduce computational costs, our
method introduces a unified score function learned on image patches instead of
entire images. Our RBDM successfully implements size-agnostic bidirectional
transitions between haze-free and hazy images with only 15 sampling steps.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior or
at least comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic
and real-world datasets.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于对比学习的跨模态谣言检测方法MICC，通过多尺度图像与文本的语义对齐提升检测效果。


<details>

Motivation: 现有谣言检测方法忽视图像内容及多尺度上下文关系，导致关键信息丢失。

Method: 设计了SCLIP编码器和跨模态多尺度对齐模块，结合互信息最大化与信息瓶颈原则，通过Top-K选择策略整合多尺度图像特征。

Result: 在两个真实数据集上验证，性能显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MICC方法有效提升了谣言检测性能，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Existing rumor detection methods often neglect the content within images as
well as the inherent relationships between contexts and images across different
visual scales, thereby resulting in the loss of critical information pertinent
to rumor identification. To address these issues, this paper presents a novel
cross-modal rumor detection scheme based on contrastive learning, namely the
Multi-scale Image and Context Correlation exploration algorithm (MICC).
Specifically, we design an SCLIP encoder to generate unified semantic
embeddings for text and multi-scale image patches through contrastive
pretraining, enabling their relevance to be measured via dot-product
similarity. Building upon this, a Cross-Modal Multi-Scale Alignment module is
introduced to identify image regions most relevant to the textual semantics,
guided by mutual information maximization and the information bottleneck
principle, through a Top-K selection strategy based on a cross-modal relevance
matrix constructed between the text and multi-scale image patches. Moreover, a
scale-aware fusion network is designed to integrate the highly correlated
multi-scale image features with global text features by assigning adaptive
weights to image regions based on their semantic importance and cross-modal
relevance. The proposed methodology has been extensively evaluated on two
real-world datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that it achieves a
substantial performance improvement over existing state-of-the-art approaches
in rumor detection, highlighting its effectiveness and potential for practical
applications.

BookCover dataset that provides narrative layouts and structured visual cues,
enabling the model to depict abstract and sequential scientific concepts with
strong semantic alignment. Through layout-conditioned generation, contrastive
visual-semantic training, and prompt modulation, LEARN produces coherent visual
sequences that support mid-to-high-level reasoning in line with Bloom's
taxonomy while reducing extraneous cognitive load as emphasized by Cognitive
Load Theory. By fostering spatially organized and story-driven narratives, the
framework counters fragmented attention often induced by short-form media and
promotes sustained conceptual focus. Beyond static diagrams, LEARN demonstrates
potential for integration with multimodal systems and curriculum-linked
knowledge graphs to create adaptive, exploratory educational content. As the

structure learning, and cognitive scaffolding, LEARN represents a novel
direction for generative AI in education. The code and dataset will be released

TL;DR: 提出一种半监督图像去雾方法EM-B3DM，通过两阶段学习方案和扩散模型，显著提升去雾效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以处理真实世界的浓雾图像，主要原因是缺乏真实配对数据和鲁棒先验。

Method: 采用EM算法和双向布朗桥扩散模型（B3DM）分两阶段学习，并引入细节增强的RDC模块。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上表现优于或与现有最佳方法相当。

Conclusion: EM-B3DM是一种高效的去雾方法，无需昂贵配对数据，性能优越。

Abstract: Existing dehazing methods deal with real-world haze images with difficulty,
especially scenes with thick haze. One of the main reasons is the lack of
real-world paired data and robust priors. To avoid the costly collection of
paired hazy and clear images, we propose an efficient semi-supervised image
dehazing method via Expectation-Maximization and Bidirectional Brownian Bridge
Diffusion Models (EM-B3DM) with a two-stage learning scheme. In the first
stage, we employ the EM algorithm to decouple the joint distribution of paired
hazy and clear images into two conditional distributions, which are then
modeled using a unified Brownian Bridge diffusion model to directly capture the
structural and content-related correlations between hazy and clear images. In
the second stage, we leverage the pre-trained model and large-scale unpaired
hazy and clear images to further improve the performance of image dehazing.
Additionally, we introduce a detail-enhanced Residual Difference Convolution
block (RDC) to capture gradient-level information, significantly enhancing the
model's representation capability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
EM-B3DM achieves superior or at least comparable performance to
state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实遥感场景中，源域数据常因隐私和传输限制不可用，导致传统域适应方法受限。源自由目标检测（SFOD）虽具潜力，但易因伪标签噪声导致训练崩溃。

Method: VG-DETR结合视觉基础模型（VFM），提出VFM引导的伪标签挖掘策略和双级对齐方法，通过对比学习和相似性匹配提升特征鲁棒性。

Result: 实验表明，VG-DETR在源自由遥感检测任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: VG-DETR通过VFM的语义先验和双级对齐，有效解决了SFOD中的伪标签噪声问题，提升了检测性能。

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation methods have been widely explored to bridge
domain gaps. However, in real-world remote-sensing scenarios, privacy and
transmission constraints often preclude access to source domain data, which
limits their practical applicability. Recently, Source-Free Object Detection
(SFOD) has emerged as a promising alternative, aiming at cross-domain
adaptation without relying on source data, primarily through a self-training
paradigm. Despite its potential, SFOD frequently suffers from training collapse
caused by noisy pseudo-labels, especially in remote sensing imagery with dense
objects and complex backgrounds. Considering that limited target domain
annotations are often feasible in practice, we propose a Vision
foundation-Guided DEtection TRansformer (VG-DETR), built upon a semi-supervised
framework for SFOD in remote sensing images. VG-DETR integrates a Vision
Foundation Model (VFM) into the training pipeline in a "free lunch" manner,
leveraging a small amount of labeled target data to mitigate pseudo-label noise
while improving the detector's feature-extraction capability. Specifically, we
introduce a VFM-guided pseudo-label mining strategy that leverages the VFM's
semantic priors to further assess the reliability of the generated
pseudo-labels. By recovering potentially correct predictions from
low-confidence outputs, our strategy improves pseudo-label quality and
quantity. In addition, a dual-level VFM-guided alignment method is proposed,
which aligns detector features with VFM embeddings at both the instance and
image levels. Through contrastive learning among fine-grained prototypes and
similarity matching between feature maps, this dual-level alignment further
enhances the robustness of feature representations against domain gaps.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that VG-DETR achieves superior performance in
source-free remote sensing detection tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为IOVQA的微调方法，用于提升视觉语言模型在视频质量评估任务中的性能，通过整数标签和针对性损失计算机制显著提高了准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在视频质量评估中存在结果不精确和损失计算效率低的问题，限制了模型对关键评估指标的关注。

Method: 提出IOVQA方法，通过约束模型输出为整数标签（范围[10,50]）并引入目标掩码策略，仅计算前两位整数的损失。

Result: 实验结果表明，IOVQA显著提升了模型在VQA任务中的准确性和一致性，在VQualA 2025挑战赛中排名第三。

Conclusion: 整数标签微调在定量评估场景中优化视觉语言模型的有效性，为相关任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of vision language models(VLM), their ability to
assess visual content based on specific criteria and dimensions has become
increasingly critical for applications such as video-theme consistency
assessment and visual quality scoring. However, existing methods often suffer
from imprecise results and inefficient loss calculation, which limit the focus
of the model on key evaluation indicators. To address this, we propose
IOVQA(Integer-only VQA), a novel fine-tuning approach tailored for VLMs to
enhance their performance in video quality assessment tasks. The key innovation
of IOVQA lies in its label construction and its targeted loss calculation
mechanism. Specifically, during dataset curation, we constrain the model's
output to integers within the range of [10,50], ensuring numerical stability,
and convert decimal Overall_MOS to integer before using them as labels. We also
introduce a target-mask strategy: when computing the loss, only the first
two-digit-integer of the label is unmasked, forcing the model to learn the
critical components of the numerical evaluation. After fine-tuning the
Qwen2.5-VL model using the constructed dataset, experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves the model's
accuracy and consistency in the VQA task, ranking 3rd in VQualA 2025
GenAI-Bench AIGC Video Quality Assessment Challenge -- Track I. Our work
highlights the effectiveness of merely leaving integer labels during
fine-tuning, providing an effective idea for optimizing VLMs in quantitative
evaluation scenarios.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为IDOD的方法，用于连续类别发现（CCD），通过独立多样性模块、联合发现模块和正交性模块，解决了现有方法在分类与新类发现之间的矛盾，同时减少了错误积累和存储占用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CCD方法难以平衡新类发现与分类任务，且容易积累错误并占用较多存储空间。

Method: IDOD方法包括独立多样性模块、联合发现模块和正交性模块，分别用于避免分类特征过度集中、减少错误积累和降低存储开销。

Result: 在细粒度数据集上，IDOD方法优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: IDOD方法有效解决了CCD中的关键问题，并在实验中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Continuous category discovery (CCD) aims to automatically discover novel
categories in continuously arriving unlabeled data. This is a challenging
problem considering that there is no number of categories and labels in the
newly arrived data, while also needing to mitigate catastrophic forgetting.
Most CCD methods cannot handle the contradiction between novel class discovery
and classification well. They are also prone to accumulate errors in the
process of gradually discovering novel classes. Moreover, most of them use
knowledge distillation and data replay to prevent forgetting, occupying more
storage space. To address these limitations, we propose Independence-based
Diversity and Orthogonality-based Discrimination (IDOD). IDOD mainly includes
independent enrichment of diversity module, joint discovery of novelty module,
and continuous increment by orthogonality module. In independent enrichment,
the backbone is trained separately using contrastive loss to avoid it focusing
only on features for classification. Joint discovery transforms multi-stage
novel class discovery into single-stage, reducing error accumulation impact.
Continuous increment by orthogonality module generates mutually orthogonal
prototypes for classification and prevents forgetting with lower space overhead
via representative representation replay. Experimental results show that on
challenging fine-grained datasets, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art
methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为LatHAdapter的新型适配器，通过利用下游数据的潜在语义层次结构，在双曲空间中优化视觉与文本表示的对齐，显著提升了少样本分类任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有适配器方法在视觉与文本表示对齐时依赖显式空间邻近性，未能捕捉类别与图像样本间的一对多关联，且难以处理未知类别。

Method: LatHAdapter引入可学习的属性提示作为桥梁，并在双曲空间中投影类别、属性提示和图像，通过层次正则化学习潜在语义层次结构。

Result: 在四个少样本任务上的实验表明，LatHAdapter优于其他微调方法，尤其在已知类别的适应和未知类别的泛化上表现突出。

Conclusion: LatHAdapter通过建模潜在语义层次结构，有效解决了现有适配器的局限性，为少样本分类任务提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Adapter-based approaches have garnered attention for fine-tuning pre-trained
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on few-shot classification tasks. These methods
strive to develop a lightweight module that better aligns visual and (category)
textual representations, thereby enhancing performance on downstream few-shot
learning tasks. However, existing adapters generally learn/align (category)
textual-visual modalities via explicit spatial proximity in the underlying
embedding space, which i) fails to capture the inherent one-to-many
associations between categories and image samples and ii) struggles to
establish accurate associations between the unknown categories and images. To
address these issues, inspired by recent works on hyperbolic learning, we
develop a novel Latent Hierarchical Adapter (LatHAdapter) for fine-tuning VLMs
on downstream few-shot classification tasks. The core of LatHAdapter is to
exploit the latent semantic hierarchy of downstream training data and employ it
to provide richer, fine-grained guidance for the adapter learning process.
Specifically, LatHAdapter first introduces some learnable `attribute' prompts
as the bridge to align categories and images. Then, it projects the categories,
attribute prompts, and images within each batch in a hyperbolic space, and
employs hierarchical regularization to learn the latent semantic hierarchy of
them, thereby fully modeling the inherent one-to-many associations among
categories, learnable attributes, and image samples. Extensive experiments on
four challenging few-shot tasks show that the proposed LatHAdapter consistently
outperforms many other fine-tuning approaches, particularly in adapting known
classes and generalizing to unknown classes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频标记化方法在空间和时间上存在冗余和适应性不足的问题，GVT旨在通过生成式高斯分布策略解决这些问题。

Method: GVT使用Spatio-Temporal Gaussian Embedding（STGE）机制生成2D高斯分布，并通过Gaussian Set Partitioning（GSP）策略分离静态和动态内容。

Result: GVT在视频重建、动作识别和压缩任务中表现优异，优于基线方法MAGVIT-v2。

Conclusion: GVT通过生成式高斯分布和时空分离策略，显著提升了视频处理的效率和性能。

Abstract: Video tokenization procedure is critical for a wide range of video processing
tasks. Most existing approaches directly transform video into fixed-grid and
patch-wise tokens, which exhibit limited versatility. Spatially, uniformly
allocating a fixed number of tokens often leads to over-encoding in
low-information regions. Temporally, reducing redundancy remains challenging
without explicitly distinguishing between static and dynamic content. In this
work, we propose the Gaussian Video Transformer (GVT), a versatile video
tokenizer built upon a generative 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) strategy. We
first extract latent rigid features from a video clip and represent them with a
set of 2D Gaussians generated by our proposed Spatio-Temporal Gaussian
Embedding (STGE) mechanism in a feed-forward manner. Such generative 2D
Gaussians not only enhance spatial adaptability by assigning higher (resp.,
lower) rendering weights to regions with higher (resp., lower) information
content during rasterization, but also improve generalization by avoiding
per-video optimization.To enhance the temporal versatility, we introduce a
Gaussian Set Partitioning (GSP) strategy that separates the 2D Gaussians into
static and dynamic sets, which explicitly model static content shared across
different time-steps and dynamic content specific to each time-step, enabling a
compact representation.We primarily evaluate GVT on the video reconstruction,
while also assessing its performance on action recognition and compression
using the UCF101, Kinetics, and DAVIS datasets. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that GVT achieves a state-of-the-art video reconstruction quality,
outperforms the baseline MAGVIT-v2 in action recognition, and delivers
comparable compression performance.

Conclusion: CHARM3R有效解决了相机高度变化对单目3D检测的影响，为未来研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Monocular 3D object detectors, while effective on data from one ego camera
height, struggle with unseen or out-of-distribution camera heights. Existing
methods often rely on Plucker embeddings, image transformations or data
augmentation. This paper takes a step towards this understudied problem by
first investigating the impact of camera height variations on state-of-the-art
(SoTA) Mono3D models. With a systematic analysis on the extended CARLA dataset
with multiple camera heights, we observe that depth estimation is a primary
factor influencing performance under height variations. We mathematically prove
and also empirically observe consistent negative and positive trends in mean
depth error of regressed and ground-based depth models, respectively, under
camera height changes. To mitigate this, we propose Camera Height Robust
Monocular 3D Detector (CHARM3R), which averages both depth estimates within the
model. CHARM3R improves generalization to unseen camera heights by more than
$45\%$, achieving SoTA performance on the CARLA dataset. Codes and Models at

Abstract: Many everyday tasks ranging from fixing appliances, cooking recipes to car

multi-step. Despite growing interest in AI agents, there is a scarcity of
dialogue-video datasets grounded for real world task assistance. In this paper,
we propose a simple yet effective approach that transforms single-person

effort required for human-assisted data collection. Using this technique, we
build HowToDIV, a large-scale dataset containing 507 conversations, 6636
question-answer pairs and 24 hours of videoclips across diverse tasks in
cooking, mechanics, and planting. Each session includes multi-turn conversation
where an expert teaches a novice user how to perform a task step by step, while
observing user's surrounding through a camera and microphone equipped wearable

through Gemma-3 model for future research on this new task of dialogues for

Motivation: 通用视觉语言模型在无人机航拍图像上性能下降，因其高分辨率、复杂语义和实时性需求限制了应用，需针对性解决方案。

Method: 采用混合训练方法（监督微调+多阶段强化学习），使用GRPO算法提升结构化推理能力，并引入HRVQA-VL数据集支持训练与评估。

Result: UAV-VL-R1在零样本任务中比基线模型Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct准确率高48.17%，甚至优于其36倍大的72B变体，且内存占用低。

Conclusion: UAV-VL-R1通过GRPO强化学习弥补了监督微调在数学任务中的多样性不足，实现了高效、轻量化的航拍图像推理，适合资源受限的无人机平台。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong
generalization in natural image tasks. However, their performance often
degrades on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based aerial imagery, which features
high resolution, complex spatial semantics, and strict real-time constraints.
These challenges limit the applicability of general-purpose VLMs to structured
aerial reasoning tasks. To address these challenges, we propose UAV-VL-R1, a
lightweight VLM explicitly designed for aerial visual reasoning. It is trained
using a hybrid method that combines supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and
multi-stage reinforcement learning (RL). We leverage the group relative policy
optimization (GRPO) algorithm to promote structured and interpretable reasoning
through rule-guided rewards and intra-group policy alignment. To support model
training and evaluation, we introduce a high-resolution visual question
answering dataset named HRVQA-VL, which consists of 50,019 annotated samples
covering eight UAV-relevant reasoning tasks, including object counting,
transportation recognition, and spatial scene inference. Experimental results
show that UAV-VL-R1 achieves a 48.17% higher zero-shot accuracy than the
Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct baseline and even outperforms its 72B-scale variant, which
is 36x larger, on multiple tasks. Ablation studies reveal that while SFT
improves semantic alignment, it may reduce reasoning diversity in mathematical
tasks. GRPO-based RL compensates for this limitation by enhancing logical
flexibility and the robustness of inference. Additionally, UAV-VL-R1 requires
only 3.9GB of memory under FP16 inference and can be quantized to 2.5GB with
INT8, supporting real-time deployment on resource-constrained UAV platforms.

Abstract: Human pose estimation has been widely applied in the human-centric
understanding and generation, but most existing state-of-the-art human pose
estimation methods require heavy computational resources for accurate
predictions. In order to obtain an accurate, robust yet lightweight human pose
estimator, one feasible way is to transfer pose knowledge from a powerful
teacher model to a less-parameterized student model by knowledge distillation.
However, the traditional knowledge distillation framework does not fully
explore the contextual information among human joints. Thus, in this paper, we
propose a novel coarse-to-fine two-stage knowledge distillation framework for
human pose estimation. In the first-stage distillation, we introduce the human
joints structure loss to mine the structural information among human joints so
as to transfer high-level semantic knowledge from the teacher model to the
student model. In the second-stage distillation, we utilize an Image-Guided
Progressive Graph Convolutional Network (IGP-GCN) to refine the initial human
pose obtained from the first-stage distillation and supervise the training of

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级不确定性模态建模（UMM）框架，用于解决多模态输入不确定或缺失时的行人重识别问题，具有高效性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 行人重识别（ReID）在自动驾驶中至关重要，但传统方法在多模态输入不确定或缺失时表现不佳，且预训练模型计算开销大。

Method: UMM框架结合了多模态令牌映射器、合成模态增强策略和跨模态线索交互学习器，利用CLIP的视觉-语言对齐能力高效融合多模态输入。

Result: 实验表明UMM在不确定模态条件下具有强鲁棒性、泛化能力和计算效率。

Conclusion: UMM为自动驾驶中的行人重识别提供了可扩展且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Re-Identification (ReID) is a critical technology in intelligent perception
systems, especially within autonomous driving, where onboard cameras must
identify pedestrians across views and time in real-time to support safe
navigation and trajectory prediction. However, the presence of uncertain or
missing input modalities--such as RGB, infrared, sketches, or textual
descriptions--poses significant challenges to conventional ReID approaches.
While large-scale pre-trained models offer strong multimodal semantic modeling
capabilities, their computational overhead limits practical deployment in
resource-constrained environments. To address these challenges, we propose a
lightweight Uncertainty Modal Modeling (UMM) framework, which integrates a
multimodal token mapper, synthetic modality augmentation strategy, and
cross-modal cue interactive learner. Together, these components enable unified
feature representation, mitigate the impact of missing modalities, and extract
complementary information across different data types. Additionally, UMM
leverages CLIP's vision-language alignment ability to fuse multimodal inputs
efficiently without extensive finetuning. Experimental results demonstrate that
UMM achieves strong robustness, generalization, and computational efficiency
under uncertain modality conditions, offering a scalable and practical solution
for pedestrian re-identification in autonomous driving scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多模态奖励模型Talking-Critic和一个大规模多维偏好数据集Talking-NSQ，并开发了TLPO框架，用于优化音频驱动肖像动画的多维偏好对齐问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以在多维偏好（如动作自然度、唇同步准确性和视觉质量）之间取得平衡，且缺乏高质量的多维偏好标注数据集。

Method: 引入Talking-Critic学习人类对齐的奖励函数，构建Talking-NSQ数据集，并提出TLPO框架，通过分专家模块优化多维偏好。

Result: Talking-Critic在人类偏好评分上显著优于现有方法，TLPO在唇同步、动作自然度和视觉质量上均有显著提升。

Conclusion: 论文通过奖励模型、数据集和优化框架的结合，成功解决了音频驱动肖像动画的多维偏好对齐问题。

Abstract: Recent advances in audio-driven portrait animation have demonstrated
impressive capabilities. However, existing methods struggle to align with
fine-grained human preferences across multiple dimensions, such as motion
naturalness, lip-sync accuracy, and visual quality. This is due to the
difficulty of optimizing among competing preference objectives, which often
conflict with one another, and the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality
datasets with multidimensional preference annotations. To address these, we
first introduce Talking-Critic, a multimodal reward model that learns
human-aligned reward functions to quantify how well generated videos satisfy
multidimensional expectations. Leveraging this model, we curate Talking-NSQ, a
large-scale multidimensional human preference dataset containing 410K
preference pairs. Finally, we propose Timestep-Layer adaptive multi-expert
Preference Optimization (TLPO), a novel framework for aligning diffusion-based
portrait animation models with fine-grained, multidimensional preferences. TLPO
decouples preferences into specialized expert modules, which are then fused
across timesteps and network layers, enabling comprehensive, fine-grained
enhancement across all dimensions without mutual interference. Experiments
demonstrate that Talking-Critic significantly outperforms existing methods in
aligning with human preference ratings. Meanwhile, TLPO achieves substantial
improvements over baseline models in lip-sync accuracy, motion naturalness, and
visual quality, exhibiting superior performance in both qualitative and
quantitative evaluations. Ours project page:

Motivation: 现有密集视觉感知任务受限于预定义类别，而CLIP在开放词汇任务中表现不佳，因其局部特征表示不足。

Method: 提出DeCLIP框架，解耦自注意力模块，分别优化内容和上下文特征，利用视觉基础模型和扩散模型增强特征。

Result: DeCLIP在多种任务（如2D检测、3D分割等）中表现优异，达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: DeCLIP为开放词汇密集感知任务提供了有效解决方案，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Dense visual perception tasks have been constrained by their reliance on
predefined categories, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios
where visual concepts are unbounded. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like
CLIP have shown promise in open-vocabulary tasks, their direct application to
dense perception often leads to suboptimal performance due to limitations in
local feature representation. In this work, we present our observation that
CLIP's image tokens struggle to effectively aggregate information from
spatially or semantically related regions, resulting in features that lack
local discriminability and spatial consistency. To address this issue, we
propose DeCLIP, a novel framework that enhances CLIP by decoupling the
self-attention module to obtain ``content'' and ``context'' features
respectively. \revise{The context features are enhanced by jointly distilling
semantic correlations from Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) and object integrity
cues from diffusion models, thereby enhancing spatial consistency. In parallel,
the content features are aligned with image crop representations and
constrained by region correlations from VFMs to improve local discriminability.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeCLIP establishes a solid foundation
for open-vocabulary dense perception, consistently achieving state-of-the-art
performance across a broad spectrum of tasks, including 2D detection and
segmentation, 3D instance segmentation, video instance segmentation, and 6D
object pose estimation.} Code is available at

Motivation: 视觉语言模型在共享表示空间中对齐图像和文本，但其可能隐含地编码和放大社会刻板印象，而标准准确性指标无法捕捉这些偏见。

Method: 研究使用220张按感知性别分类的面部照片和150条描述职业和活动的短语，计算图像和文本嵌入的余弦相似性，并通过自举置信区间和标签交换零模型评估性别关联。

Result: 研究提供了一个详细的性别关联映射，揭示了视觉语言空间中存在的性别偏见，并提出了一个稳健的性别偏见评估框架。

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型可能隐含地强化性别刻板印象，需要更细致的评估方法来检测和缓解这些偏见。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLM) align images and text in a shared representation
space that is useful for retrieval and zero-shot transfer. Yet, this alignment
can encode and amplify social stereotypes in subtle ways that are not obvious
from standard accuracy metrics. In this study, we test whether the contrastive
vision-language encoder exhibits gender-linked associations when it places
embeddings of face images near embeddings of short phrases that describe
occupations and activities. We assemble a dataset of 220 face photographs split
by perceived binary gender and a set of 150 unique statements distributed
across six categories covering emotional labor, cognitive labor, domestic
labor, technical labor, professional roles, and physical labor. We compute
unit-norm image embeddings for every face and unit-norm text embeddings for
every statement, then define a statement-level association score as the
difference between the mean cosine similarity to the male set and the mean
cosine similarity to the female set, where positive values indicate stronger
association with the male set and negative values indicate stronger association
with the female set. We attach bootstrap confidence intervals by resampling
images within each gender group, aggregate by category with a separate
bootstrap over statements, and run a label-swap null model that estimates the
level of mean absolute association we would expect if no gender structure were
present. The outcome is a statement-wise and category-wise map of gender
associations in a contrastive vision-language space, accompanied by
uncertainty, simple sanity checks, and a robust gender bias evaluation
framework.

Conclusion: 通过类别级几何学习和一致性对齐，显著提升了模型在未见环境中的泛化能力。

Abstract: Domain generalization in 3D segmentation is a critical challenge in deploying
models to unseen environments. Current methods mitigate the domain shift by
augmenting the data distribution of point clouds. However, the model learns
global geometric patterns in point clouds while ignoring the category-level
distribution and alignment. In this paper, a category-level geometry learning
framework is proposed to explore the domain-invariant geometric features for
domain generalized 3D semantic segmentation. Specifically, Category-level
Geometry Embedding (CGE) is proposed to perceive the fine-grained geometric
properties of point cloud features, which constructs the geometric properties
of each class and couples geometric embedding to semantic learning. Secondly,
Geometric Consistent Learning (GCL) is proposed to simulate the latent 3D
distribution and align the category-level geometric embeddings, allowing the
model to focus on the geometric invariant information to improve
generalization. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed
method, which has very competitive segmentation accuracy compared with the
state-of-the-art domain generalized point cloud methods.

Motivation: 现有方法在组合图像检索中需要额外训练排序模型，且Chain-of-Thought（CoT）技术在CIR任务中应用有限，难以在监督CIR中取得满意结果。

Method: 设计了Pyramid Matching Model和Training-Free Refinement（PMTFR）框架，利用Pyramid Patcher模块增强视觉信息理解，并从CoT数据中提取表示注入LVLMs。

Result: 在CIR基准测试中，PMTFR超越了现有最优方法。

Conclusion: PMTFR框架通过简单有效的模块和训练无关的优化，显著提升了监督CIR任务的性能。

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) presents a significant challenge as it
requires jointly understanding a reference image and a modified textual
instruction to find relevant target images. Some existing methods attempt to
use a two-stage approach to further refine retrieval results. However, this
often requires additional training of a ranking model. Despite the success of
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques in reducing training costs for language
models, their application in CIR tasks remains limited -- compressing visual
information into text or relying on elaborate prompt designs. Besides, existing
works only utilize it for zero-shot CIR, as it is challenging to achieve
satisfactory results in supervised CIR with a well-trained model. In this work,
we proposed a framework that includes the Pyramid Matching Model with
Training-Free Refinement (PMTFR) to address these challenges. Through a simple
but effective module called Pyramid Patcher, we enhanced the Pyramid Matching
Model's understanding of visual information at different granularities.
Inspired by representation engineering, we extracted representations from COT
data and injected them into the LVLMs. This approach allowed us to obtain
refined retrieval scores in the Training-Free Refinement paradigm without
relying on explicit textual reasoning, further enhancing performance. Extensive
experiments on CIR benchmarks demonstrate that PMTFR surpasses state-of-the-art
methods in supervised CIR tasks. The code will be made public.

Motivation: 尽管SAE在语言模型中广泛应用，但在视觉领域的研究较少，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Result: SAE特征具有语义意义，提升泛化能力，并支持可控生成。

Conclusion: SAE在视觉模型中具有提升可解释性、泛化能力和可控性的潜力。

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a popular tool for interpreting
the hidden states of large language models (LLMs). By learning to reconstruct
activations from a sparse bottleneck layer, SAEs discover interpretable
features from the high-dimensional internal representations of LLMs. Despite
their popularity with language models, SAEs remain understudied in the visual
domain. In this work, we provide an extensive evaluation the representational
power of SAEs for vision models using a broad range of image-based tasks. Our
experimental results demonstrate that SAE features are semantically meaningful,
improve out-of-distribution generalization, and enable controllable generation
across three vision model architectures: vision embedding models, multi-modal
LMMs and diffusion models. In vision embedding models, we find that learned SAE
features can be used for OOD detection and provide evidence that they recover
the ontological structure of the underlying model. For diffusion models, we
demonstrate that SAEs enable semantic steering through text encoder
manipulation and develop an automated pipeline for discovering
human-interpretable attributes. Finally, we conduct exploratory experiments on
multi-modal LLMs, finding evidence that SAE features reveal shared
representations across vision and language modalities. Our study provides a
foundation for SAE evaluation in vision models, highlighting their strong
potential improving interpretability, generalization, and steerability in the
visual domain.

Conclusion: 该框架通过伪度量深度估计和时间细化，显著提升了单目内窥镜组织的3D重建效果。

Abstract: Accurate endoscope pose estimation and 3D tissue surface reconstruction
significantly enhances monocular minimally invasive surgical procedures by
enabling accurate navigation and improved spatial awareness. However, monocular
endoscope pose estimation and tissue reconstruction face persistent challenges,
including depth ambiguity, physiological tissue deformation, inconsistent
endoscope motion, limited texture fidelity, and a restricted field of view. To
overcome these limitations, a unified framework for monocular endoscopic tissue
reconstruction that integrates scale-aware depth prediction with
temporally-constrained perceptual refinement is presented. This framework
incorporates a novel MAPIS-Depth module, which leverages Depth Pro for robust
initialisation and Depth Anything for efficient per-frame depth prediction, in
conjunction with L-BFGS-B optimisation, to generate pseudo-metric depth
estimates. These estimates are temporally refined by computing pixel
correspondences using RAFT and adaptively blending flow-warped frames based on
LPIPS perceptual similarity, thereby reducing artefacts arising from
physiological tissue deformation and motion. To ensure accurate registration of
the synthesised pseudo-RGBD frames from MAPIS-Depth, a novel WEMA-RTDL module
is integrated, optimising both rotation and translation. Finally, truncated
signed distance function-based volumetric fusion and marching cubes are applied
to extract a comprehensive 3D surface mesh. Evaluations on HEVD and SCARED,
with ablation and comparative analyses, demonstrate the framework's robustness
and superiority over state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: With the advancement of generative models, facial image editing has made
significant progress. However, achieving fine-grained age editing while
preserving personal identity remains a challenging task.In this paper, we
propose TimeMachine, a novel diffusion-based framework that achieves accurate
age editing while keeping identity features unchanged. To enable fine-grained
age editing, we inject high-precision age information into the multi-cross
attention module, which explicitly separates age-related and identity-related
features. This design facilitates more accurate disentanglement of age
attributes, thereby allowing precise and controllable manipulation of facial
aging.Furthermore, we propose an Age Classifier Guidance (ACG) module that
predicts age directly in the latent space, instead of performing denoising
image reconstruction during training. By employing a lightweight module to
incorporate age constraints, this design enhances age editing accuracy by
modest increasing training cost. Additionally, to address the lack of
large-scale, high-quality facial age datasets, we construct a HFFA dataset
(High-quality Fine-grained Facial-Age dataset) which contains one million
high-resolution images labeled with identity and facial attributes.
Experimental results demonstrate that TimeMachine achieves state-of-the-art
performance in fine-grained age editing while preserving identity consistency.

Abstract: Pedestrian segmentation in automotive perception systems faces critical
safety challenges due to metamerism in RGB imaging, where pedestrians and
backgrounds appear visually indistinguishable.. This study investigates the
potential of hyperspectral imaging (HSI) for enhanced pedestrian segmentation
in urban driving scenarios using the Hyperspectral City v2 (H-City) dataset. We
compared standard RGB against two dimensionality-reduction approaches by
converting 128-channel HSI data into three-channel representations: Principal
Component Analysis (PCA) and optimal band selection using Contrast
Signal-to-Noise Ratio with Joint Mutual Information Maximization (CSNR-JMIM).
Three semantic segmentation models were evaluated: U-Net, DeepLabV3+, and
SegFormer. CSNR-JMIM consistently outperformed RGB with an average improvements
of 1.44% in Intersection over Union (IoU) and 2.18% in F1-score for pedestrian
segmentation. Rider segmentation showed similar gains with 1.43% IoU and 2.25%
F1-score improvements. These improved performance results from enhanced
spectral discrimination of optimally selected HSI bands effectively reducing
false positives. This study demonstrates robust pedestrian segmentation through
optimal HSI band selection, showing significant potential for safety-critical
automotive applications.

Result: 在Charades-STA和QVHighlights数据集上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 去噪后检索范式可提升VMR性能，且易于集成到其他模型中。

Abstract: Current text-driven Video Moment Retrieval (VMR) methods encode all video
clips, including irrelevant ones, disrupting multimodal alignment and hindering
optimization. To this end, we propose a denoise-then-retrieve paradigm that
explicitly filters text-irrelevant clips from videos and then retrieves the
target moment using purified multimodal representations. Following this
paradigm, we introduce the Denoise-then-Retrieve Network (DRNet), comprising
Text-Conditioned Denoising (TCD) and Text-Reconstruction Feedback (TRF)
modules. TCD integrates cross-attention and structured state space blocks to
dynamically identify noisy clips and produce a noise mask to purify multimodal
video representations. TRF further distills a single query embedding from
purified video representations and aligns it with the text embedding, serving
as auxiliary supervision for denoising during training. Finally, we perform
conditional retrieval using text embeddings on purified video representations
for accurate VMR. Experiments on Charades-STA and QVHighlights demonstrate that
our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods on all metrics. Furthermore,
our denoise-then-retrieve paradigm is adaptable and can be seamlessly
integrated into advanced VMR models to boost performance.

Result: LogicCLIP在所有LogicBench领域显著提升逻辑理解能力，同时保持通用视觉语言任务的竞争力。

Conclusion: LogicBench和LogicCLIP为提升VLM逻辑能力提供了重要资源，且逻辑增强不影响通用性能。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs), exemplified by CLIP, have emerged as
foundational for multimodal intelligence. However, their capacity for logical
understanding remains significantly underexplored, resulting in critical
''logical blindspots'' that limit their reliability in practical applications.
To systematically diagnose this, we introduce LogicBench, a comprehensive
benchmark with over 50,000 vision-language pairs across 9 logical categories
and 4 diverse scenarios: images, videos, anomaly detection, and medical
diagnostics. Our evaluation reveals that existing VLMs, even the
state-of-the-art ones, fall at over 40 accuracy points below human performance,
particularly in challenging tasks like Causality and Conditionality,
highlighting their reliance on surface semantics over critical logical
structures. To bridge this gap, we propose LogicCLIP, a novel training
framework designed to boost VLMs' logical sensitivity through advancements in
both data generation and optimization objectives. LogicCLIP utilizes
logic-aware data generation and a contrastive learning strategy that combines
coarse-grained alignment, a fine-grained multiple-choice objective, and a novel
logical structure-aware objective. Extensive experiments demonstrate
LogicCLIP's substantial improvements in logical comprehension across all
LogicBench domains, significantly outperforming baselines. Moreover, LogicCLIP
retains, and often surpasses, competitive performance on general
vision-language benchmarks, demonstrating that the enhanced logical
understanding does not come at the expense of general alignment. We believe
that LogicBench and LogicCLIP will be important resources for advancing VLM
logical capabilities.

Conclusion: DSC-Track通过一致性空间线索建模，显著提升了复杂场景下的3D多目标跟踪性能。

Abstract: 3D multi-object tracking is a critical and challenging task in the field of
autonomous driving. A common paradigm relies on modeling individual object
motion, e.g., Kalman filters, to predict trajectories. While effective in
simple scenarios, this approach often struggles in crowded environments or with
inaccurate detections, as it overlooks the rich geometric relationships between
objects. This highlights the need to leverage spatial cues. However, existing
geometry-aware methods can be susceptible to interference from irrelevant
objects, leading to ambiguous features and incorrect associations. To address
this, we propose focusing on cue-consistency: identifying and matching stable
spatial patterns over time. We introduce the Dynamic Scene Cue-Consistency
Tracker (DSC-Track) to implement this principle. Firstly, we design a unified
spatiotemporal encoder using Point Pair Features (PPF) to learn discriminative
trajectory embeddings while suppressing interference. Secondly, our
cue-consistency transformer module explicitly aligns consistent feature
representations between historical tracks and current detections. Finally, a
dynamic update mechanism preserves salient spatiotemporal information for
stable online tracking. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and Waymo Open
Datasets validate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach. On the
nuScenes benchmark, for instance, our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance, reaching 73.2% and 70.3% AMOTA on the validation and test sets,

Conclusion: NoOp通过优化噪声解决了DC的噪声不稳定性问题，显著提升了分类效率和性能。

Abstract: Although today's pretrained discriminative vision-language models (e.g.,
CLIP) have demonstrated strong perception abilities, such as zero-shot image
classification, they also suffer from the bag-of-words problem and spurious
bias. To mitigate these problems, some pioneering studies leverage powerful
generative models (e.g., pretrained diffusion models) to realize generalizable
image classification, dubbed Diffusion Classifier (DC). Specifically, by
randomly sampling a Gaussian noise, DC utilizes the differences of denoising
effects with different category conditions to classify categories.
Unfortunately, an inherent and notorious weakness of existing DCs is noise
instability: different random sampled noises lead to significant performance
changes. To achieve stable classification performance, existing DCs always
ensemble the results of hundreds of sampled noises, which significantly reduces
the classification speed. To this end, we firstly explore the role of noise in
DC, and conclude that: there are some ``good noises'' that can relieve the
instability. Meanwhile, we argue that these good noises should meet two
principles: Frequency Matching and Spatial Matching. Regarding both principles,
we propose a novel Noise Optimization method to learn matching (i.e., good)
noise for DCs: NoOp. For frequency matching, NoOp first optimizes a
dataset-specific noise: Given a dataset and a timestep t, optimize one randomly
initialized parameterized noise. For Spatial Matching, NoOp trains a
Meta-Network that adopts an image as input and outputs image-specific noise
offset. The sum of optimized noise and noise offset will be used in DC to
replace random noise. Extensive ablations on various datasets demonstrated the
effectiveness of NoOp.

TL;DR: GANDiff FR是一个合成框架，通过精确控制人口统计和环境因素来测量、解释和减少偏见，结合StyleGAN3和扩散模型实现精细属性控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在提供一种可重复、可量化的方法来识别和减少人脸识别系统中的偏见。

Method: 结合StyleGAN3的身份保留生成和扩散模型的属性控制，生成10,000张人口平衡的面孔，并在ArcFace、CosFace和AdaFace上测试。

Result: AdaFace将组间TPR差异减少60%，光照占剩余偏见的42%，合成数据与真实数据相关性达0.85。

Conclusion: GANDiff FR为公平性审计提供了可重复的标准，尽管计算开销较高，但能生成更多属性条件变体。

Abstract: We introduce GANDiff FR, the first synthetic framework that precisely
controls demographic and environmental factors to measure, explain, and reduce
bias with reproducible rigor. GANDiff FR unifies StyleGAN3-based
identity-preserving generation with diffusion-based attribute control, enabling
fine-grained manipulation of pose around 30 degrees, illumination (four
directions), and expression (five levels) under ceteris paribus conditions. We
synthesize 10,000 demographically balanced faces across five cohorts validated
for realism via automated detection (98.2%) and human review (89%) to isolate
and quantify bias drivers. Benchmarking ArcFace, CosFace, and AdaFace under
matched operating points shows AdaFace reduces inter-group TPR disparity by 60%
(2.5% vs. 6.3%), with illumination accounting for 42% of residual bias.
Cross-dataset evaluation on RFW, BUPT, and CASIA WebFace confirms strong
synthetic-to-real transfer (r 0.85). Despite around 20% computational overhead
relative to pure GANs, GANDiff FR yields three times more attribute-conditioned
variants, establishing a reproducible, regulation-aligned (EU AI Act) standard
for fairness auditing. Code and data are released to support transparent,
scalable bias evaluation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为IAQD的新蒸馏方法，用于解决基于Transformer的增量目标检测中的知识遗忘问题，通过索引对齐的查询蒸馏取代匈牙利匹配，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在基于Transformer的增量目标检测中，匈牙利匹配可能导致知识遗忘，因此需要一种更有效的方法来保持旧类别知识。

Method: 提出IAQD方法，通过索引对齐的查询蒸馏，仅对关键查询进行蒸馏，避免干扰新类别的学习。

Result: 实验表明，IAQD有效减少了知识遗忘，达到了新的最优性能。

Conclusion: IAQD是一种高效的蒸馏方法，适用于增量目标检测任务。

Abstract: Incremental object detection (IOD) aims to continuously expand the capability
of a model to detect novel categories while preserving its performance on
previously learned ones. When adopting a transformer-based detection model to
perform IOD, catastrophic knowledge forgetting may inevitably occur, meaning
the detection performance on previously learned categories may severely
degenerate. Previous typical methods mainly rely on knowledge distillation (KD)
to mitigate the catastrophic knowledge forgetting of transformer-based
detection models. Specifically, they utilize Hungarian Matching to build a
correspondence between the queries of the last-phase and current-phase
detection models and align the classifier and regressor outputs between matched
queries to avoid knowledge forgetting. However, we observe that in IOD task,
Hungarian Matching is not a good choice. With Hungarian Matching, the query of
the current-phase model may match different queries of the last-phase model at
different iterations during KD. As a result, the knowledge encoded in each
query may be reshaped towards new categories, leading to the forgetting of
previously encoded knowledge of old categories. Based on our observations, we
propose a new distillation approach named Index-Aligned Query Distillation
(IAQD) for transformer-based IOD. Beyond using Hungarian Matching, IAQD
establishes a correspondence between queries of the previous and current phase
models that have the same index. Moreover, we perform index-aligned
distillation only on partial queries which are critical for the detection of
previous categories. In this way, IAQD largely preserves the previous semantic
and spatial encoding capabilities without interfering with the learning of new
categories. Extensive experiments on representative benchmarks demonstrate that
IAQD effectively mitigates knowledge forgetting, achieving new state-of-the-art
performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动分类方法需要大量代表性训练数据，人工成本高昂甚至难以承担。

Method: 利用分类器对未标注宫颈细胞图像的不确定性，选择最有益的图像进行标注。

Result: 新算法通过快速估计不确定性，显著提升了训练数据集的代表性能力。

Conclusion: 该方法在降低人工成本的同时，实现了高效的宫颈细胞分类，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Information on the number and category of cervical cells is crucial for the
diagnosis of cervical cancer. However, existing classification methods capable
of automatically measuring this information require the training dataset to be
representative, which consumes an expensive or even unaffordable human cost. We
herein propose active labeling that enables us to construct a representative
training dataset using a much smaller human cost for data-efficient cervical
cell classification. This cost-effective method efficiently leverages the
classifier's uncertainty on the unlabeled cervical cell images to accurately
select images that are most beneficial to label. With a fast estimation of the
uncertainty, this new algorithm exhibits its validity and effectiveness in
enhancing the representative ability of the constructed training dataset. The
extensive empirical results confirm its efficacy again in navigating the usage
of human cost, opening the avenue for data-efficient cervical cell
classification.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于语义指导的对抗目标选择框架，利用跨模态知识迁移从预训练的语言和视觉语言模型中选择目标标签，优于传统静态方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗攻击的目标标签选择方法通常依赖随机性、模型预测或静态语义资源，限制了可解释性、可重复性或灵活性。

Method: 提出语义引导框架，利用BERT、TinyLLAMA和CLIP等模型作为相似性来源，选择与真实标签最相关和最不相关的标签，形成最佳和最差对抗场景。

Result: 实验表明，这些模型能提供实用的对抗目标，并优于WordNet等静态数据库，尤其在远距离类别关系上。静态测试也验证了相似性来源的有效性。

Conclusion: 预训练模型适合构建可解释、标准化和可扩展的对抗基准，适用于不同架构和数据集。

Abstract: In targeted adversarial attacks on vision models, the selection of the target
label is a critical yet often overlooked determinant of attack success. This
target label corresponds to the class that the attacker aims to force the model
to predict. Now, existing strategies typically rely on randomness, model
predictions, or static semantic resources, limiting interpretability,
reproducibility, or flexibility. This paper then proposes a semantics-guided
framework for adversarial target selection using the cross-modal knowledge
transfer from pretrained language and vision-language models. We evaluate
several state-of-the-art models (BERT, TinyLLAMA, and CLIP) as similarity
sources to select the most and least semantically related labels with respect
to the ground truth, forming best- and worst-case adversarial scenarios. Our
experiments on three vision models and five attack methods reveal that these
models consistently render practical adversarial targets and surpass static
lexical databases, such as WordNet, particularly for distant class
relationships. We also observe that static testing of target labels offers a
preliminary assessment of the effectiveness of similarity sources, \textit{a
priori} testing. Our results corroborate the suitability of pretrained models
for constructing interpretable, standardized, and scalable adversarial
benchmarks across architectures and datasets.

TL;DR: HOID-R1框架结合链式思维（CoT）监督微调（SFT）和组相对策略优化（GRPO），提升人-物交互（HOI）检测性能，并在开放世界泛化中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开放词汇HOI检测方法依赖大语言模型但忽略其3D空间理解能力，HOID-R1旨在弥补这一不足。

Method: 结合CoT引导的SFT和GRPO强化学习范式，引入MLLM监督机制减少幻觉。

Result: HOID-R1在HOI检测基准上达到最优性能，开放世界泛化能力优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HOID-R1通过多模态对齐和推理能力提升，为HOI检测提供了新思路。

Abstract: Understanding and recognizing human-object interaction (HOI) is a pivotal
application in AR/VR and robotics. Recent open-vocabulary HOI detection
approaches depend exclusively on large language models for richer textual
prompts, neglecting their inherent 3D spatial understanding capabilities. To
address this shortcoming, we introduce HOID-R1, the first HOI detection
framework that integrates chain-of-thought (CoT) guided supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) with group relative policy optimization (GRPO) within a reinforcement
learning (RL) paradigm. Specifically, we initially apply SFT to imbue the model
with essential reasoning capabilities, forcing the model to articulate its
thought process in the output. Subsequently, we integrate GRPO to leverage
multi-reward signals for policy optimization, thereby enhancing alignment
across diverse modalities. To mitigate hallucinations in the CoT reasoning, we
introduce an "MLLM-as-a-judge" mechanism that supervises the CoT outputs,
further improving generalization. Extensive experiments show that HOID-R1
achieves state-of-the-art performance on HOI detection benchmarks and
outperforms existing methods in open-world generalization to novel scenarios.

Motivation: 探索RETFound模型在视盘分割任务中的潜力，验证其作为通用基础模型的适用性。

Method: 通过训练一个轻量级的头部网络，将RETFound模型适配于视盘分割任务。

Result: 在多个公开和私有数据集上达到约96%的Dice分数，性能优于现有分割专用模型。

Conclusion: RETFound模型在视盘分割任务中表现卓越，支持基础模型替代任务专用架构的潜力。

Abstract: RETFound is a well-known foundation model (FM) developed for fundus camera
and optical coherence tomography images. It has shown promising performance
across multiple datasets in diagnosing diseases, both eye-specific and
systemic, from retinal images. However, to our best knowledge, it has not been
used for other tasks. We present the first adaptation of RETFound for optic
disc segmentation, a ubiquitous and foundational task in retinal image
analysis. The resulting segmentation system outperforms state-of-the-art,
segmentation-specific baseline networks after training a head with only a very
modest number of task-specific examples. We report and discuss results with
four public datasets, IDRID, Drishti-GS, RIM-ONE-r3, and REFUGE, and a private
dataset, GoDARTS, achieving about 96% Dice consistently across all datasets.
Overall, our method obtains excellent performance in internal verification,
domain generalization and domain adaptation, and exceeds most of the
state-of-the-art baseline results. We discuss the results in the framework of
the debate about FMs as alternatives to task-specific architectures. The code

Method: 通过理论分析SRL的梯度，并在多个管状数据集上与传统基线模型进行性能对比。

Result: SRL在实验中的表现未超越传统基线模型。

Conclusion: 拓扑保持损失函数在复杂管状结构分割中存在局限性，为未来研究提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Image segmentation is an important and widely performed task in computer
vision. Accomplishing effective image segmentation in diverse settings often
requires custom model architectures and loss functions. A set of models that
specialize in segmenting thin tubular structures are topology
preservation-based loss functions. These models often utilize a pixel
skeletonization process claimed to generate more precise segmentation masks of
thin tubes and better capture the structures that other models often miss. One
such model, Skeleton Recall Loss (SRL) proposed by Kirchhoff et al.~\cite
{kirchhoff2024srl}, was stated to produce state-of-the-art results on benchmark
tubular datasets. In this work, we performed a theoretical analysis of the
gradients for the SRL loss. Upon comparing the performance of the proposed
method on some of the tubular datasets (used in the original work, along with
some additional datasets), we found that the performance of SRL-based
segmentation models did not exceed traditional baseline models. By providing
both a theoretical explanation and empirical evidence, this work critically
evaluates the limitations of topology-based loss functions, offering valuable
insights for researchers aiming to develop more effective segmentation models
for complex tubular structures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统知识蒸馏方法在捕捉细粒度实例级细节和复杂关系结构时表现不足，导致性能欠佳。

Method: 提出两种新损失函数：实例级嵌入蒸馏（动态硬挖掘策略）和关系相似性蒸馏（记忆库机制和样本挖掘策略）。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上优于现有蒸馏方法，学生模型甚至能超越教师模型。

Conclusion: 统一框架实现了更全面的知识蒸馏，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation is crucial for optimizing face recognition models for
deployment in computationally limited settings, such as edge devices.
Traditional KD methods, such as Raw L2 Feature Distillation or Feature
Consistency loss, often fail to capture both fine-grained instance-level
details and complex relational structures, leading to suboptimal performance.
We propose a unified approach that integrates two novel loss functions,
Instance-Level Embedding Distillation and Relation-Based Pairwise Similarity
Distillation. Instance-Level Embedding Distillation focuses on aligning
individual feature embeddings by leveraging a dynamic hard mining strategy,
thereby enhancing learning from challenging examples. Relation-Based Pairwise
Similarity Distillation captures relational information through pairwise
similarity relationships, employing a memory bank mechanism and a sample mining
strategy. This unified framework ensures both effective instance-level
alignment and preservation of geometric relationships between samples, leading
to a more comprehensive distillation process. Our unified framework outperforms
state-of-the-art distillation methods across multiple benchmark face
recognition datasets, as demonstrated by extensive experimental evaluations.
Interestingly, when using strong teacher networks compared to the student, our
unified KD enables the student to even surpass the teacher's accuracy.

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，显著提升了3D重建和多视图任务的性能。

Conclusion: G-CUT3R能有效利用先验信息，兼容不同输入模态，具有灵活性和高性能。

Abstract: We introduce G-CUT3R, a novel feed-forward approach for guided 3D scene
reconstruction that enhances the CUT3R model by integrating prior information.
Unlike existing feed-forward methods that rely solely on input images, our
method leverages auxiliary data, such as depth, camera calibrations, or camera
positions, commonly available in real-world scenarios. We propose a lightweight
modification to CUT3R, incorporating a dedicated encoder for each modality to
extract features, which are fused with RGB image tokens via zero convolution.
This flexible design enables seamless integration of any combination of prior
information during inference. Evaluated across multiple benchmarks, including
3D reconstruction and other multi-view tasks, our approach demonstrates
significant performance improvements, showing its ability to effectively

Motivation: 大气湍流导致视频质量下降，现有方法计算成本高且难以实时部署。

Method: 采用轻量级循环框架，仅需两帧输入，结合多尺度特征编码和解码模块。

Result: 在SSIM指标上提升近9%，推理速度提高四倍以上。

Conclusion: RMFAT在清晰度恢复和实时性能上优于现有方法，适合实时应用。

Abstract: Atmospheric turbulence severely degrades video quality by introducing
distortions such as geometric warping, blur, and temporal flickering, posing
significant challenges to both visual clarity and temporal consistency. Current
state-of-the-art methods are based on transformer and 3D architectures and
require multi-frame input, but their large computational cost and memory usage
limit real-time deployment, especially in resource-constrained scenarios. In
this work, we propose RMFAT: Recurrent Multi-scale Feature Atmospheric
Turbulence Mitigator, designed for efficient and temporally consistent video
restoration under AT conditions. RMFAT adopts a lightweight recurrent framework
that restores each frame using only two inputs at a time, significantly
reducing temporal window size and computational burden. It further integrates
multi-scale feature encoding and decoding with temporal warping modules at both
encoder and decoder stages to enhance spatial detail and temporal coherence.
Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world atmospheric turbulence
datasets demonstrate that RMFAT not only outperforms existing methods in terms
of clarity restoration (with nearly a 9\% improvement in SSIM) but also
achieves significantly improved inference speed (more than a fourfold reduction
in runtime), making it particularly suitable for real-time atmospheric
turbulence suppression tasks.

Abstract: Deep neural networks have become the go-to method for biomedical instance
segmentation. Generalist models like Cellpose demonstrate state-of-the-art
performance across diverse cellular data, though their effectiveness often
degrades on domains that differ from their training data. While supervised
fine-tuning can address this limitation, it requires annotated data that may
not be readily available. We propose SelfAdapt, a method that enables the
adaptation of pre-trained cell segmentation models without the need for labels.
Our approach builds upon student-teacher augmentation consistency training,
introducing L2-SP regularization and label-free stopping criteria. We evaluate
our method on the LiveCell and TissueNet datasets, demonstrating relative
improvements in AP0.5 of up to 29.64% over baseline Cellpose. Additionally, we
show that our unsupervised adaptation can further improve models that were
previously fine-tuned with supervision. We release SelfAdapt as an easy-to-use

Motivation: 生物识别技术广泛应用，但模板的隐私和安全性是关键问题。多模态融合能提升安全性，但计算复杂度高，尤其是在同态加密下。

Method: 利用深度神经网络提取特征，通过维度缩减减少特征向量尺寸，并在同态加密下实现高效处理。

Result: 实验表明，多模态融合可将模板尺寸减少67%，且不影响等错误率（EER）。

Conclusion: 多模态特征融合在保持安全性和准确性的同时，显著提升了计算效率。

Abstract: Biometric recognition is widely used, making the privacy and security of
extracted templates a critical concern. Biometric Template Protection schemes,
especially those utilizing Homomorphic Encryption, introduce significant
computational challenges due to increased workload. Recent advances in deep
neural networks have enabled state-of-the-art feature extraction for face,
fingerprint, and iris modalities. The ubiquity and affordability of biometric
sensors further facilitate multi-modal fusion, which can enhance security by
combining features from different modalities. This work investigates the
biometric performance of reduced multi-biometric template sizes. Experiments
are conducted on an in-house virtual multi-biometric database, derived from
DNN-extracted features for face, fingerprint, and iris, using the FRGC, MCYT,
and CASIA databases. The evaluated approaches are (i) explainable and
straightforward to implement under encryption, (ii) training-free, and (iii)
capable of generalization. Dimensionality reduction of feature vectors leads to
fewer operations in the Homomorphic Encryption (HE) domain, enabling more
efficient encrypted processing while maintaining biometric accuracy and
security at a level equivalent to or exceeding single-biometric recognition.
Our results demonstrate that, by fusing feature vectors from multiple
modalities, template size can be reduced by 67 % with no loss in Equal Error
Rate (EER) compared to the best-performing single modality.

Motivation: 自动驾驶需要结合多模态上下文理解和精确预测，但现有方法（如VLM和DWM）各有局限，整合二者可互补优势。

Method: 提出ImagiDrive框架，将VLM驱动的行为预测与DWM驱动的场景生成结合，并通过迭代优化和效率策略（如早停机制）提升性能。

Result: 在nuScenes和NAVSIM数据集上，ImagiDrive在开环和闭环条件下均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ImagiDrive通过整合VLM和DWM，实现了高效且准确的自动驾驶规划与场景生成。

Abstract: Autonomous driving requires rich contextual comprehension and precise
predictive reasoning to navigate dynamic and complex environments safely.
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and Driving World Models (DWMs) have
independently emerged as powerful recipes addressing different aspects of this
challenge. VLMs provide interpretability and robust action prediction through
their ability to understand multi-modal context, while DWMs excel in generating
detailed and plausible future driving scenarios essential for proactive
planning. Integrating VLMs with DWMs is an intuitive, promising, yet
understudied strategy to exploit the complementary strengths of accurate
behavioral prediction and realistic scene generation. Nevertheless, this
integration presents notable challenges, particularly in effectively connecting
action-level decisions with high-fidelity pixel-level predictions and
maintaining computational efficiency. In this paper, we propose ImagiDrive, a
novel end-to-end autonomous driving framework that integrates a VLM-based
driving agent with a DWM-based scene imaginer to form a unified
imagination-and-planning loop. The driving agent predicts initial driving
trajectories based on multi-modal inputs, guiding the scene imaginer to
generate corresponding future scenarios. These imagined scenarios are
subsequently utilized to iteratively refine the driving agent's planning
decisions. To address efficiency and predictive accuracy challenges inherent in
this integration, we introduce an early stopping mechanism and a trajectory
selection strategy. Extensive experimental validation on the nuScenes and
NAVSIM datasets demonstrates the robustness and superiority of ImagiDrive over
previous alternatives under both open-loop and closed-loop conditions.

Conclusion: 当前3D物体移除技术需更鲁棒的解决方案以应对现实世界的复杂性。

Abstract: Understanding what semantic information persists after object removal is
critical for privacy-preserving 3D reconstruction and editable scene
representations. In this work, we introduce a novel benchmark and evaluation
framework to measure semantic residuals, the unintended semantic traces left
behind, after object removal in 3D Gaussian Splatting. We conduct experiments
across a diverse set of indoor and outdoor scenes, showing that current methods
can preserve semantic information despite the absence of visual geometry. We
also release Remove360, a dataset of pre/post-removal RGB images and
object-level masks captured in real-world environments. While prior datasets
have focused on isolated object instances, Remove360 covers a broader and more
complex range of indoor and outdoor scenes, enabling evaluation of object
removal in the context of full-scene representations. Given ground truth images
of a scene before and after object removal, we assess whether we can truly
eliminate semantic presence, and if downstream models can still infer what was
removed. Our findings reveal critical limitations in current 3D object removal
techniques and underscore the need for more robust solutions capable of
handling real-world complexity. The evaluation framework is available at

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with unified architectures excel
across a wide range of vision-language tasks, yet aligning them with
personalized image generation remains a significant challenge. Existing methods
for MLLMs are frequently subject-specific, demanding a data-intensive
fine-tuning process for every new subject, which limits their scalability. In
this paper, we introduce MM-R1, a framework that integrates a cross-modal
Chain-of-Thought (X-CoT) reasoning strategy to unlock the inherent potential of
unified MLLMs for personalized image generation. Specifically, we structure
personalization as an integrated visual reasoning and generation process: (1)
grounding subject concepts by interpreting and understanding user-provided
images and contextual cues, and (2) generating personalized images conditioned
on both the extracted subject representations and user prompts. To further
enhance the reasoning capability, we adopt Grouped Reward Proximal Policy
Optimization (GRPO) to explicitly align the generation. Experiments demonstrate
that MM-R1 unleashes the personalization capability of unified MLLMs to
generate images with high subject fidelity and strong text alignment in a
zero-shot manner.

*Daniel Airinei,Elena Burceanu,Marius Leordeanu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于视觉输入的室内导航深度学习方法，无需GPS、特殊传感器或地图，通过图像预测目标方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 室内导航因GPS信号差而困难，现有解决方案复杂且部署困难，需依赖额外信息。

Method: 采用基于图路径生成的新方法，结合可解释数据增强和课程学习，实现高效、自动化的数据收集与训练。

Result: 创建了一个大型购物中心视频数据集，并开发了Android应用，仅依赖视觉输入即可导航。

Conclusion: 该方法高效、实时且易于部署，解决了现有方案的复杂性问题，代码和数据公开。

Abstract: Indoor navigation is a difficult task, as it generally comes with poor GPS
access, forcing solutions to rely on other sources of information. While
significant progress continues to be made in this area, deployment to
production applications is still lacking, given the complexity and additional
requirements of current solutions. Here, we introduce an efficient, real-time
and easily deployable deep learning approach, based on visual input only, that
can predict the direction towards a target from images captured by a mobile
device. Our technical approach, based on a novel graph-based path generation
method, combined with explainable data augmentation and curriculum learning,
includes contributions that make the process of data collection, annotation and
training, as automatic as possible, efficient and robust. On the practical
side, we introduce a novel largescale dataset, with video footage inside a
relatively large shopping mall, in which each frame is annotated with the
correct next direction towards different specific target destinations.
Different from current methods, ours relies solely on vision, avoiding the need
of special sensors, additional markers placed along the path, knowledge of the
scene map or internet access. We also created an easy to use application for
Android, which we plan to make publicly available. We make all our data and
code available along with visual demos on our project site

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监督学习方法依赖大量标注，而少样本学习难以捕捉精细结构，因此需要一种高效且精确的分割方法。

Method: CoFi通过轻量级网络生成粗分割掩码，再结合形态学修剪生成高质量点提示，引导SAM模型进行精细分割。

Result: Dice系数达74.54%，推理速度为1.9 FPS，显著优于传统方法。

Conclusion: CoFi在减少标注和计算负担的同时，实现了高精度分割，适用于研究和临床病理学。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) in electron
microscopy (EM) images is fundamental for quantifying membrane thickness and
supporting the diagnosis of various kidney diseases. While supervised deep
learning approaches achieve high segmentation accuracy, their reliance on
extensive pixel-level annotation renders them impractical for clinical
workflows. Few-shot learning can reduce this annotation burden but often
struggles to capture the fine structural details necessary for GBM analysis. In
this study, we introduce CoFi, a fast and efficient coarse-to-fine few-shot
segmentation pipeline designed for GBM delineation in EM images. CoFi first
trains a lightweight neural network using only three annotated images to
produce an initial coarse segmentation mask. This mask is then automatically
processed to generate high-quality point prompts with morphology-aware pruning,
which are subsequently used to guide SAM in refining the segmentation. The
proposed method achieved exceptional GBM segmentation performance, with a Dice
coefficient of 74.54% and an inference speed of 1.9 FPS. We demonstrate that
CoFi not only alleviates the annotation and computational burdens associated
with conventional methods, but also achieves accurate and reliable segmentation
results. The pipeline's speed and annotation efficiency make it well-suited for
research and hold strong potential for clinical applications in renal
pathology. The pipeline is publicly available at:

Abstract: Abnormal Human Behavior Detection (AHBD) under special scenarios is becoming
increasingly crucial. While YOLO-based detection methods excel in real-time
tasks, they remain hindered by challenges including small objects, task
conflicts, and multi-scale fusion in AHBD. To tackle them, we propose
TACR-YOLO, a new real-time framework for AHBD. We introduce a Coordinate
Attention Module to enhance small object detection, a Task-Aware Attention
Module to deal with classification-regression conflicts, and a Strengthen Neck
Network for refined multi-scale fusion, respectively. In addition, we optimize
Anchor Box sizes using K-means clustering and deploy DIoU-Loss to improve
bounding box regression. The Personnel Anomalous Behavior Detection (PABD)
dataset, which includes 8,529 samples across four behavior categories, is also
presented. Extensive experimental results indicate that TACR-YOLO achieves
91.92% mAP on PABD, with competitive speed and robustness. Ablation studies
highlight the contribution of each improvement. This work provides new insights
for abnormal behavior detection under special scenarios, advancing its
progress.

Abstract: The construction industry increasingly relies on visual data to support
Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) applications for site
monitoring. High-quality, domain-specific datasets, comprising images, videos,
and point clouds, capture site geometry and spatiotemporal dynamics, including
the location and interaction of objects, workers, and materials. However,
despite growing interest in leveraging visual datasets, existing resources vary
widely in sizes, data modalities, annotation quality, and representativeness of
real-world construction conditions. A systematic review to categorize their
data characteristics and application contexts is still lacking, limiting the
community's ability to fully understand the dataset landscape, identify
critical gaps, and guide future directions toward more effective, reliable, and
scalable AI applications in construction. To address this gap, this study
conducts an extensive search of academic databases and open-data platforms,
yielding 51 publicly available visual datasets that span the 2005-2024 period.
These datasets are categorized using a structured data schema covering (i) data
fundamentals (e.g., size and license), (ii) data modalities (e.g., RGB and
point cloud), (iii) annotation frameworks (e.g., bounding boxes), and (iv)
downstream application domains (e.g., progress tracking). This study
synthesizes these findings into an open-source catalog, OpenConstruction,
supporting data-driven method development. Furthermore, the study discusses
several critical limitations in the existing construction dataset landscape and
presents a roadmap for future data infrastructure anchored in the Findability,
Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability (FAIR) principles. By
reviewing the current landscape and outlining strategic priorities, this study
supports the advancement of data-centric solutions in the construction sector.

TL;DR: CineTrans是一个新框架，用于生成具有电影风格过渡的多镜头视频，通过注意力映射和掩码控制机制实现稳定过渡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管视频合成技术取得了显著进展，但多镜头视频生成的研究仍处于初级阶段，现有模型的镜头过渡能力有限且不稳定。

Method: 构建了Cine250K数据集，利用扩散模型的注意力映射设计掩码控制机制，实现任意位置的过渡。

Result: CineTrans生成的视频在过渡控制、时间一致性和整体质量上显著优于现有基线。

Conclusion: CineTrans为多镜头视频生成提供了稳定且符合电影编辑风格的解决方案。

Abstract: Despite significant advances in video synthesis, research into multi-shot
video generation remains in its infancy. Even with scaled-up models and massive
datasets, the shot transition capabilities remain rudimentary and unstable,
largely confining generated videos to single-shot sequences. In this work, we
introduce CineTrans, a novel framework for generating coherent multi-shot
videos with cinematic, film-style transitions. To facilitate insights into the
film editing style, we construct a multi-shot video-text dataset Cine250K with
detailed shot annotations. Furthermore, our analysis of existing video
diffusion models uncovers a correspondence between attention maps in the
diffusion model and shot boundaries, which we leverage to design a mask-based
control mechanism that enables transitions at arbitrary positions and transfers
effectively in a training-free setting. After fine-tuning on our dataset with
the mask mechanism, CineTrans produces cinematic multi-shot sequences while
adhering to the film editing style, avoiding unstable transitions or naive
concatenations. Finally, we propose specialized evaluation metrics for
transition control, temporal consistency and overall quality, and demonstrate
through extensive experiments that CineTrans significantly outperforms existing
baselines across all criteria.

Abstract: Detailed data is required to quantify energy conservation measures in
buildings, such as envelop retrofits, without compromising cultural heritage.
Novel artificial intelligence tools may improve efficiency in identifying
heritage values in buildings compared to costly and time-consuming traditional
inventories. In this study, the large language model GPT was used to detect
various aspects of cultural heritage value in fa\c{c}ade images. Using this
data and building register data as features, machine learning models were
trained to classify multi-family and non-residential buildings in Stockholm,
Sweden. Validation against an expert-created inventory shows a macro F1-score
of 0.71 using a combination of register data and features retrieved from GPT,
and a score of 0.60 using only GPT-derived data. The presented methodology can
contribute to a higher-quality database and thus support careful energy
efficiency measures and integrated consideration of heritage value in
large-scale energetic refurbishment scenarios.

Motivation: 现有方法采用感知-规划分离的范式，限制了规划导向的优化潜力。VeteranAD旨在通过感知与规划的紧密耦合，实现更精准的自动驾驶行为。

Method: 设计了感知-规划一体化框架，利用多模式锚定轨迹作为规划先验，感知模块针对性采集轨迹相关交通元素，并采用自回归策略逐步预测未来轨迹。

Result: 在NAVSIM和Bench2Drive数据集上，VeteranAD实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: VeteranAD通过感知与规划的深度融合，显著提升了端到端自动驾驶的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving has achieved remarkable advancements in recent
years. Existing methods primarily follow a perception-planning paradigm, where
perception and planning are executed sequentially within a fully differentiable
framework for planning-oriented optimization. We further advance this paradigm
through a perception-in-plan framework design, which integrates perception into
the planning process. This design facilitates targeted perception guided by
evolving planning objectives over time, ultimately enhancing planning
performance. Building on this insight, we introduce VeteranAD, a coupled
perception and planning framework for end-to-end autonomous driving. By
incorporating multi-mode anchored trajectories as planning priors, the
perception module is specifically designed to gather traffic elements along
these trajectories, enabling comprehensive and targeted perception. Planning
trajectories are then generated based on both the perception results and the
planning priors. To make perception fully serve planning, we adopt an
autoregressive strategy that progressively predicts future trajectories while
focusing on relevant regions for targeted perception at each step. With this
simple yet effective design, VeteranAD fully unleashes the potential of
planning-oriented end-to-end methods, leading to more accurate and reliable
driving behavior. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM and Bench2Drive datasets
demonstrate that our VeteranAD achieves state-of-the-art performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNN在视觉识别任务中表现优异，但其依赖规则网格结构，难以建模复杂拓扑关系和非局部语义。

Method: HGFE构建了两种互补的图结构：局部空间依赖的窗口内图卷积和全局语义关系的窗口间超节点交互，并引入自适应频率调制模块平衡信号传播。

Result: 在多个数据集（CIFAR-100、PASCAL VOC等）上的实验验证了HGFE在提升结构表示和整体识别性能上的有效性。

Conclusion: HGFE是一种轻量级、端到端可训练的模块，可无缝集成到标准CNN中，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have
  demonstrated strong performance in visual recognition tasks,
  but their inherent reliance on regular grid structures limits
  their capacity to model complex topological relationships and
  non-local semantics within images. To address this limita tion, we propose
the hierarchical graph feature enhancement
  (HGFE), a novel framework that integrates graph-based rea soning into CNNs to
enhance both structural awareness and
  feature representation. HGFE builds two complementary levels
  of graph structures: intra-window graph convolution to cap ture local spatial
dependencies and inter-window supernode
  interactions to model global semantic relationships. Moreover,
  we introduce an adaptive frequency modulation module that
  dynamically balances low-frequency and high-frequency signal
  propagation, preserving critical edge and texture information
  while mitigating over-smoothing. The proposed HGFE module
  is lightweight, end-to-end trainable, and can be seamlessly
  integrated into standard CNN backbone networks. Extensive
  experiments on CIFAR-100 (classification), PASCAL VOC,
  and VisDrone (detection), as well as CrackSeg and CarParts
  (segmentation), validated the effectiveness of the HGFE in
  improving structural representation and enhancing overall
  recognition performance.

Abstract: Historical handwritten text recognition (HTR) is essential for unlocking the
cultural and scholarly value of archival documents, yet digitization is often
hindered by scarce transcriptions, linguistic variation, and highly diverse
handwriting styles. In this study, we apply TrOCR, a state-of-the-art
transformer-based HTR model, to 16th-century Latin manuscripts authored by
Rudolf Gwalther. We investigate targeted image preprocessing and a broad suite
of data augmentation techniques, introducing four novel augmentation methods
designed specifically for historical handwriting characteristics. We also
evaluate ensemble learning approaches to leverage the complementary strengths
of augmentation-trained models. On the Gwalther dataset, our best single-model
augmentation (Elastic) achieves a Character Error Rate (CER) of 1.86, while a
top-5 voting ensemble achieves a CER of 1.60 - representing a 50% relative
improvement over the best reported TrOCR_BASE result and a 42% improvement over
the previous state of the art. These results highlight the impact of
domain-specific augmentations and ensemble strategies in advancing HTR
performance for historical manuscripts.

Result: 在多个数据集上验证，AIM显著提升可解释性（EPG分数）和准确性。

Conclusion: AIM能有效促进模型使用真实特征，提升泛化能力和人类对齐的可解释性。

Abstract: It has been observed that deep neural networks (DNNs) often use both genuine
as well as spurious features. In this work, we propose "Amending Inherent
Interpretability via Self-Supervised Masking" (AIM), a simple yet interestingly
effective method that promotes the network's utilization of genuine features
over spurious alternatives without requiring additional annotations. In
particular, AIM uses features at multiple encoding stages to guide a
self-supervised, sample-specific feature-masking process. As a result, AIM
enables the training of well-performing and inherently interpretable models
that faithfully summarize the decision process. We validate AIM across a
diverse range of challenging datasets that test both out-of-distribution
generalization and fine-grained visual understanding. These include
general-purpose classification benchmarks such as ImageNet100, HardImageNet,
and ImageWoof, as well as fine-grained classification datasets such as
Waterbirds, TravelingBirds, and CUB-200. AIM demonstrates significant dual
benefits: interpretability improvements, as measured by the Energy Pointing
Game (EPG) score, and accuracy gains over strong baselines. These consistent
gains across domains and architectures provide compelling evidence that AIM
promotes the use of genuine and meaningful features that directly contribute to
improved generalization and human-aligned interpretability.

Abstract: Accelerated aging of transportation infrastructure in the rapidly developing
Yangtze River Delta region necessitates efficient concrete crack detection, as
crack deterioration critically compromises structural integrity and regional
economic growth. To overcome the limitations of inefficient manual inspection
and the suboptimal performance of existing deep learning models, particularly
for small-target crack detection within complex backgrounds, this paper
proposes YOLOv11-KW-TA-FP, a multi-task concrete crack detection and
segmentation model based on the YOLOv11n architecture. The proposed model
integrates a three-stage optimization framework: (1) Embedding dynamic
KernelWarehouse convolution (KWConv) within the backbone network to enhance
feature representation through a dynamic kernel sharing mechanism; (2)
Incorporating a triple attention mechanism (TA) into the feature pyramid to
strengthen channel-spatial interaction modeling; and (3) Designing an FP-IoU
loss function to facilitate adaptive bounding box regression penalization.
Experimental validation demonstrates that the enhanced model achieves
significant performance improvements over the baseline, attaining 91.3%
precision, 76.6% recall, and 86.4% mAP@50. Ablation studies confirm the
synergistic efficacy of the proposed modules. Furthermore, robustness tests
indicate stable performance under conditions of data scarcity and noise
interference. This research delivers an efficient computer vision solution for
automated infrastructure inspection, exhibiting substantial practical
engineering value.

TL;DR: 提出了一种多状态跟踪器（MST），通过轻量级状态增强和跨状态交互提升特征表示能力，显著提高跟踪精度和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高效跟踪器因降低计算复杂度和模型参数而牺牲了特征表示能力，限制了其在复杂环境中的准确性。

Method: MST采用多状态生成（MSG）、状态特定增强（SSE）和跨状态交互（CSI）模块，通过轻量级设计增强特征表示。

Result: MST在多个数据集上表现优于现有高效跟踪器，计算开销仅0.1 GFLOPs和0.66 M参数，AO分数提升4.5%。

Conclusion: MST通过轻量级设计显著提升了跟踪性能，适用于复杂环境。

Abstract: Efficient trackers achieve faster runtime by reducing computational
complexity and model parameters. However, this efficiency often compromises the
expense of weakened feature representation capacity, thus limiting their
ability to accurately capture target states using single-layer features. To
overcome this limitation, we propose Multi-State Tracker (MST), which utilizes
highly lightweight state-specific enhancement (SSE) to perform specialized
enhancement on multi-state features produced by multi-state generation (MSG)
and aggregates them in an interactive and adaptive manner using cross-state
interaction (CSI). This design greatly enhances feature representation while
incurring minimal computational overhead, leading to improved tracking
robustness in complex environments. Specifically, the MSG generates multiple
state representations at multiple stages during feature extraction, while SSE
refines them to highlight target-specific features. The CSI module facilitates
information exchange between these states and ensures the integration of
complementary features. Notably, the introduced SSE and CSI modules adopt a
highly lightweight hidden state adaptation-based state space duality (HSA-SSD)
design, incurring only 0.1 GFLOPs in computation and 0.66 M in parameters.
Experimental results demonstrate that MST outperforms all previous efficient
trackers across multiple datasets, significantly improving tracking accuracy
and robustness. In particular, it shows excellent runtime performance, with an
AO score improvement of 4.5\% over the previous SOTA efficient tracker HCAT on
the GOT-10K dataset. The code is available at https://github.com/wsumel/MST.

Conclusion: 该方法为资源受限环境下的医学图像分类提供了高效可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Intelligent analysis of medical imaging plays a crucial role in assisting
clinical diagnosis. However, achieving efficient and high-accuracy image
classification in resource-constrained computational environments remains
challenging. This study proposes a medical image classification method based on
an improved ConvNeXt-Tiny architecture. Through structural optimization and
loss function design, the proposed method enhances feature extraction
capability and classification performance while reducing computational
complexity. Specifically, the method introduces a dual global pooling (Global
Average Pooling and Global Max Pooling) feature fusion strategy into the
ConvNeXt-Tiny backbone to simultaneously preserve global statistical features
and salient response information. A lightweight channel attention module,
termed Squeeze-and-Excitation Vector (SEVector), is designed to improve the
adaptive allocation of channel weights while minimizing parameter overhead.
Additionally, a Feature Smoothing Loss is incorporated into the loss function
to enhance intra-class feature consistency and suppress intra-class variance.
Under CPU-only conditions (8 threads), the method achieves a maximum
classification accuracy of 89.10% on the test set within 10 training epochs,
exhibiting a stable convergence trend in loss values. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed method effectively improves medical image
classification performance in resource-limited settings, providing a feasible
and efficient solution for the deployment and promotion of medical imaging
analysis models.

Abstract: Video reasoning segmentation (VRS) endeavors to delineate referred objects in

However, this paradigm suffers from limited interpretability during inference

inspiration from seminal breakthroughs in reinforcement learning, we introduce
Veason-R1, a specialized LVLM for VRS that emphasizes structured reasoning in
segmentation. Veason-R1 is trained through Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) augmented with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) initialization. To begin with, we
curate high-quality CoT training data to instill structured reasoning
trajectories, bridging video-level semantics and frame-level spatial grounding,
yielding the supervised fine-tuned model Veason-SFT. Subsequently, GRPO
fine-tuning encourages efficient exploration of the reasoning space by
optimizing reasoning chains. To this end, we incorporate a holistic reward
mechanism that synergistically enhances spatial alignment and temporal
consistency, bolstering keyframe localization and fine-grained grounding.
Comprehensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that Veason-R1 achieves
state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, surpassing prior art by
significant margins (e.g., +1.3 J &F in ReVOS and +10.0 J &F in ReasonVOS),
while exhibiting robustness to hallucinations (+8.8 R). Our code and model
weights will be available at Veason-R1.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Stable Diffusion的无训练异常生成框架AAG，通过Cross-Attention Enhancement和Self-Attention Enhancement技术生成逼真异常图像，提升下游异常检测任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业异常检测中数据稀缺问题突出，现有异常生成方法缺乏逼真性或需额外训练数据。

Method: AAG框架利用Stable Diffusion生成异常图像，结合CAE和SAE技术优化生成效果。

Result: 在MVTec AD和VisA数据集上验证了AAG的有效性，生成的异常图像提升了异常检测任务性能。

Conclusion: AAG为工业异常检测提供了一种高效、无需训练的异常生成解决方案。

Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection (AD) plays a significant role in manufacturing
where a long-standing challenge is data scarcity. A growing body of works have
emerged to address insufficient anomaly data via anomaly generation. However,
these anomaly generation methods suffer from lack of fidelity or need to be
trained with extra data. To this end, we propose a training-free anomaly
generation framework dubbed AAG, which is based on Stable Diffusion (SD)'s
strong generation ability for effective anomaly image generation. Given a
normal image, mask and a simple text prompt, AAG can generate realistic and
natural anomalies in the specific regions and simultaneously keep contents in
other regions unchanged. In particular, we propose Cross-Attention Enhancement
(CAE) to re-engineer the cross-attention mechanism within Stable Diffusion
based on the given mask. CAE increases the similarity between visual tokens in
specific regions and text embeddings, which guides these generated visual
tokens in accordance with the text description. Besides, generated anomalies
need to be more natural and plausible with object in given image. We propose
Self-Attention Enhancement (SAE) which improves similarity between each normal
visual token and anomaly visual tokens. SAE ensures that generated anomalies
are coherent with original pattern. Extensive experiments on MVTec AD and VisA
datasets demonstrate effectiveness of AAG in anomaly generation and its
utility. Furthermore, anomaly images generated by AAG can bolster performance
of various downstream anomaly inspection tasks.

Motivation: 体育分析领域存在数据不可用、缺乏有效轨迹框架和标签不足的问题，TrajSV旨在解决这些问题。

Method: TrajSV包括数据预处理、Clip Representation Network (CRNet)和Video Representation Network (VRNet)三个模块，通过轨迹增强的Transformer和对比损失优化表示。

Result: 在足球、篮球和排球视频中，TrajSV在检索、动作识别和视频描述任务中表现优异，检索性能提升近70%，动作识别在17类中9类领先，视频描述提升近20%。

Conclusion: TrajSV通过轨迹框架和对比损失优化，显著提升了体育视频分析的性能，并展示了实际部署系统的潜力。

Abstract: Sports analytics has received significant attention from both academia and
industry in recent years. Despite the growing interest and efforts in this
field, several issues remain unresolved, including (1) data unavailability, (2)
lack of an effective trajectory-based framework, and (3) requirement for
sufficient supervision labels. In this paper, we present TrajSV, a
trajectory-based framework that addresses various issues in existing studies.
TrajSV comprises three components: data preprocessing, Clip Representation
Network (CRNet), and Video Representation Network (VRNet). The data
preprocessing module extracts player and ball trajectories from sports
broadcast videos. CRNet utilizes a trajectory-enhanced Transformer module to
learn clip representations based on these trajectories. Additionally, VRNet
learns video representations by aggregating clip representations and visual
features with an encoder-decoder architecture. Finally, a triple contrastive
loss is introduced to optimize both video and clip representations in an
unsupervised manner. The experiments are conducted on three broadcast video
datasets to verify the effectiveness of TrajSV for three types of sports (i.e.,
soccer, basketball, and volleyball) with three downstream applications (i.e.,
sports video retrieval, action spotting, and video captioning). The results
demonstrate that TrajSV achieves state-of-the-art performance in sports video
retrieval, showcasing a nearly 70% improvement. It outperforms baselines in
action spotting, achieving state-of-the-art results in 9 out of 17 action
categories, and demonstrates a nearly 20% improvement in video captioning.
Additionally, we introduce a deployed system along with the three applications
based on TrajSV.

*Yumeng Shi,Quanyu Long,Yin Wu,Wenya Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现，视频语言模型（VideoLMs）中，去除或修改位置编码（PEs）对时间理解性能影响较小，而反转帧序列会导致性能显著下降。时间信息通过帧间注意力逐步合成，最终整合到查询令牌中。基于此，提出了两种效率优化策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频语言模型在多模态理解方面取得进展，但时间理解（如事件顺序、持续时间和跨时间关系）仍是核心挑战。研究旨在揭示时间信息在模型中的整合机制。

Method: 通过分析实验追踪时间信息在模型中的整合路径，发现时间线索通过帧间注意力逐步合成并整合到查询令牌中。提出了两种效率优化策略：分阶段跨模态注意力和时间退出机制。

Result: 实验验证了两种策略的有效性，表明时间推理源于视觉令牌间的交互，并在因果注意力约束下隐式编码时间结构。

Conclusion: 本研究首次系统探讨了视频语言模型中的时间理解机制，为未来模型改进提供了见解。

Abstract: Video language models (VideoLMs) have made significant progress in multimodal
understanding. However, temporal understanding, which involves identifying
event order, duration, and relationships across time, still remains a core
challenge. Prior works emphasize positional encodings (PEs) as a key mechanism
for encoding temporal structure. Surprisingly, we find that removing or
modifying PEs in video inputs yields minimal degradation in the performance of
temporal understanding. In contrast, reversing the frame sequence while
preserving the original PEs causes a substantial drop. To explain this
behavior, we conduct substantial analysis experiments to trace how temporal
information is integrated within the model. We uncover a causal information
pathway: temporal cues are progressively synthesized through inter-frame
attention, aggregated in the final frame, and subsequently integrated into the
query tokens. This emergent mechanism shows that temporal reasoning emerges
from inter-visual token interactions under the constraints of causal attention,
which implicitly encodes temporal structure. Based on these insights, we
propose two efficiency-oriented strategies: staged cross-modal attention and a
temporal exit mechanism for early token truncation. Experiments on two
benchmarks validate the effectiveness of both approaches. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first work to systematically investigate video temporal
understanding in VideoLMs, offering insights for future model improvement.

<details>

Motivation: 传统遥感方法（如LiDAR）成本高且不适用于实时监测，本研究旨在提供一种快速、低成本且实时的替代方案。

Method: 结合单目深度估计、深度误差校正和几何三角测量，从车载摄像头视频中提取空间和结构数据。

Result: 深度校正模型表现优异（R2=0.92），低速车内摄像头条件下定位误差为2.83米，高度估计误差为2.09米（树木）和0.88米（杆状物）。

Conclusion: 该框架为城市植被和基础设施监测提供了实时、低成本且高效的解决方案，适用于公用事业公司和城市规划者。

Abstract: Our study introduces a novel, low-cost, and reproducible framework for
real-time, object-level structural assessment and geolocation of roadside
vegetation and infrastructure with commonly available but underutilized
dashboard camera (dashcam) video data. We developed an end-to-end pipeline that
combines monocular depth estimation, depth error correction, and geometric
triangulation to generate accurate spatial and structural data from
street-level video streams from vehicle-mounted dashcams. Depth maps were first
estimated using a state-of-the-art monocular depth model, then refined via a
gradient-boosted regression framework to correct underestimations, particularly
for distant objects. The depth correction model achieved strong predictive
performance (R2 = 0.92, MAE = 0.31 on transformed scale), significantly
reducing bias beyond 15 m. Further, object locations were estimated using
GPS-based triangulation, while object heights were calculated using pin hole
camera geometry. Our method was evaluated under varying conditions of camera
placement and vehicle speed. Low-speed vehicle with inside camera gave the
highest accuracy, with mean geolocation error of 2.83 m, and mean absolute
error (MAE) in height estimation of 2.09 m for trees and 0.88 m for poles. To
the best of our knowledge, it is the first framework to combine monocular depth
modeling, triangulated GPS-based geolocation, and real-time structural
assessment for urban vegetation and infrastructure using consumer-grade video
data. Our approach complements conventional RS methods, such as LiDAR and image
by offering a fast, real-time, and cost-effective solution for object-level
monitoring of vegetation risks and infrastructure exposure, making it
especially valuable for utility companies, and urban planners aiming for
scalable and frequent assessments in dynamic urban environments.

TL;DR: CoreEditor提出了一种新的文本驱动3D编辑框架，通过引入对应约束注意力机制和语义相似性，解决了多视角一致性问题，显著提升了编辑质量和细节清晰度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在文本驱动的3D编辑中难以保持多视角一致性，导致编辑效果不足和细节模糊。

Method: CoreEditor采用对应约束注意力机制和语义相似性建模，结合选择性编辑流程，实现多视角一致性和用户控制。

Result: 实验表明，CoreEditor能够生成高质量、3D一致的编辑结果，细节更清晰，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CoreEditor通过创新的注意力机制和语义建模，有效解决了多视角一致性问题，为文本驱动3D编辑提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: Text-driven 3D editing seeks to modify 3D scenes according to textual
descriptions, and most existing approaches tackle this by adapting pre-trained
2D image editors to multi-view inputs. However, without explicit control over
multi-view information exchange, they often fail to maintain cross-view
consistency, leading to insufficient edits and blurry details. We introduce
CoreEditor, a novel framework for consistent text-to-3D editing. The key
innovation is a correspondence-constrained attention mechanism that enforces
precise interactions between pixels expected to remain consistent throughout
the diffusion denoising process. Beyond relying solely on geometric alignment,
we further incorporate semantic similarity estimated during denoising, enabling
more reliable correspondence modeling and robust multi-view editing. In
addition, we design a selective editing pipeline that allows users to choose
preferred results from multiple candidates, offering greater flexibility and
user control. Extensive experiments show that CoreEditor produces high-quality,
3D-consistent edits with sharper details, significantly outperforming prior
methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种通过奖励引导解码的方法来适配多模态大语言模型（MLLMs），以提升其视觉定位能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着MLLMs的广泛应用，需要适应多样化用户需求，尤其是视觉定位的改进。

Method: 构建了两个独立的奖励模型，分别控制对象精度和召回率，并通过动态调整奖励函数权重和解码搜索广度实现可控性。

Result: 在标准对象幻觉基准测试中，该方法显著优于现有幻觉缓解方法，并提供了高度的可控性。

Conclusion: 该方法为MLLMs的推理过程提供了灵活的控制手段，同时提升了视觉定位性能。

Abstract: As Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) gain widespread applicability, it
is becoming increasingly desirable to adapt them for diverse user needs. In
this paper, we study the adaptation of MLLMs through controlled decoding. To
achieve this, we introduce the first method for reward-guided decoding of MLLMs
and demonstrate its application in improving their visual grounding. Our method
involves building reward models for visual grounding and using them to guide
the MLLM's decoding process. Concretely, we build two separate reward models to
independently control the degree of object precision and recall in the model's
output. Our approach enables on-the-fly controllability of an MLLM's inference
process in two ways: first, by giving control over the relative importance of
each reward function during decoding, allowing a user to dynamically trade off
object precision for recall in image captioning tasks; second, by giving
control over the breadth of the search during decoding, allowing the user to
control the trade-off between the amount of test-time compute and the degree of
visual grounding. We evaluate our method on standard object hallucination
benchmarks, showing that it provides significant controllability over MLLM
inference, while consistently outperforming existing hallucination mitigation
methods.

TL;DR: LoRAtorio是一种无需训练的多LoRA组合框架，通过利用模型内在行为解决现有方法在多LoRA组合中的不足，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在多LoRA组合中表现不佳，尤其是在开放场景中，无法有效处理未知数量和类型的技能。

Method: 通过空间分块计算余弦相似度，构建空间感知权重矩阵，加权聚合LoRA输出，并结合分类器自由引导解决领域漂移。

Result: LoRAtorio在ClipScore上提升1.3%，GPT-4V评估中胜率达72.43%，并适用于多种潜在扩散模型。

Conclusion: LoRAtorio在多LoRA组合中表现卓越，为开放场景下的视觉概念个性化提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has become a widely adopted technique in
text-to-image diffusion models, enabling the personalisation of visual concepts
such as characters, styles, and objects. However, existing approaches struggle
to effectively compose multiple LoRA adapters, particularly in open-ended
settings where the number and nature of required skills are not known in
advance. In this work, we present LoRAtorio, a novel train-free framework for
multi-LoRA composition that leverages intrinsic model behaviour. Our method is
motivated by two key observations: (1) LoRA adapters trained on narrow domains
produce denoised outputs that diverge from the base model, and (2) when
operating out-of-distribution, LoRA outputs show behaviour closer to the base
model than when conditioned in distribution. The balance between these two
observations allows for exceptional performance in the single LoRA scenario,
which nevertheless deteriorates when multiple LoRAs are loaded. Our method
operates in the latent space by dividing it into spatial patches and computing
cosine similarity between each patch's predicted noise and that of the base
model. These similarities are used to construct a spatially-aware weight
matrix, which guides a weighted aggregation of LoRA outputs. To address domain
drift, we further propose a modification to classifier-free guidance that
incorporates the base model's unconditional score into the composition. We
extend this formulation to a dynamic module selection setting, enabling
inference-time selection of relevant LoRA adapters from a large pool. LoRAtorio
achieves state-of-the-art performance, showing up to a 1.3% improvement in
ClipScore and a 72.43% win rate in GPT-4V pairwise evaluations, and generalises
effectively to multiple latent diffusion models.

Motivation: 评估GPT-5和GPT-4o在乳腺X光筛查任务中的潜力，以支持乳腺癌诊断。

Method: 在四个公开乳腺X光数据集上测试GPT-5和GPT-4o，评估BI-RADS分级、异常检测和恶性分类任务。

Result: GPT-5在各项任务中表现最佳，但敏感性和特异性低于人类专家。

Conclusion: GPT-5在乳腺X光筛查中显示出潜力，但仍需领域优化才能用于高风险临床场景。

Abstract: Mammogram visual question answering (VQA) integrates image interpretation
with clinical reasoning and has potential to support breast cancer screening.
We systematically evaluated the GPT-5 family and GPT-4o model on four public
mammography datasets (EMBED, InBreast, CMMD, CBIS-DDSM) for BI-RADS assessment,
abnormality detection, and malignancy classification tasks. GPT-5 consistently
was the best performing model but lagged behind both human experts and
domain-specific fine-tuned models. On EMBED, GPT-5 achieved the highest scores
among GPT variants in density (56.8%), distortion (52.5%), mass (64.5%),
calcification (63.5%), and malignancy (52.8%) classification. On InBreast, it
attained 36.9% BI-RADS accuracy, 45.9% abnormality detection, and 35.0%
malignancy classification. On CMMD, GPT-5 reached 32.3% abnormality detection
and 55.0% malignancy accuracy. On CBIS-DDSM, it achieved 69.3% BI-RADS
accuracy, 66.0% abnormality detection, and 58.2% malignancy accuracy. Compared
with human expert estimations, GPT-5 exhibited lower sensitivity (63.5%) and
specificity (52.3%). While GPT-5 exhibits promising capabilities for screening
tasks, its performance remains insufficient for high-stakes clinical imaging
applications without targeted domain adaptation and optimization. However, the
tremendous improvements in performance from GPT-4o to GPT-5 show a promising
trend in the potential for general large language models (LLMs) to assist with
mammography VQA tasks.

Motivation: 现有开源模型在图像处理和逻辑推理能力上不如专有模型（O3），Thyme旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 引入Thyme范式，通过两阶段训练（SFT和RL）实现自主生成和执行代码，提出GRPO-ATS算法优化决策。

Result: 在近20个基准测试中表现优异，尤其在复杂推理和高分辨率感知任务中。

Conclusion: Thyme为多模态模型提供了更丰富的图像处理和逻辑推理能力，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Following OpenAI's introduction of the ``thinking with images'' concept,
recent efforts have explored stimulating the use of visual information in the
reasoning process to enhance model performance in perception and reasoning
tasks. However, to the best of our knowledge, no open-source work currently
offers a feature set as rich as proprietary models (O3), which can perform
diverse image manipulations and simultaneously enhance logical reasoning
capabilities through code. In this paper, we make a preliminary attempt in this
direction by introducing Thyme (Think Beyond Images), a novel paradigm for
enabling MLLMs to transcend existing ``think with images'' approaches by
autonomously generating and executing diverse image processing and
computational operations via executable code. This approach not only
facilitates a rich, on-the-fly set of image manipulations (e.g., cropping,
rotation, contrast enhancement) but also allows for mathematical computations,
all while maintaining high autonomy in deciding when and how to apply these
operations. We activate this capability through a two-stage training strategy:
an initial SFT on a curated dataset of 500K samples to teach code generation,
followed by a RL phase to refine decision-making. For the RL stage, we manually
collect and design high-resolution question-answer pairs to increase the
learning difficulty, and we propose GRPO-ATS (Group Relative Policy
Optimization with Adaptive Temperature Sampling), an algorithm that applies
distinct temperatures to text and code generation to balance reasoning
exploration with code execution precision. We conduct extensive experimental
analysis and ablation studies. Comprehensive evaluations on nearly 20
benchmarks show that Thyme yields significant and consistent performance gains,
particularly in challenging high-resolution perception and complex reasoning
tasks.

Abstract: The development of porous polymeric membranes remains a labor-intensive
process, often requiring extensive trial and error to identify optimal
fabrication parameters. In this study, we present a fully automated platform
for membrane fabrication and characterization via nonsolvent-induced phase
separation (NIPS). The system integrates automated solution preparation, blade
casting, controlled immersion, and compression testing, allowing precise
control over fabrication parameters such as polymer concentration and ambient
humidity. The modular design allows parallel processing and reproducible
handling of samples, reducing experimental time and increasing consistency.
Compression testing is introduced as a sensitive mechanical characterization
method for estimating membrane stiffness and as a proxy to infer porosity and
intra-sample uniformity through automated analysis of stress-strain curves. As
a proof of concept to demonstrate the effectiveness of the system, NIPS was
carried out with polysulfone, the green solvent PolarClean, and water as the
polymer, solvent, and nonsolvent, respectively. Experiments conducted with the
automated system reproduced expected effects of polymer concentration and
ambient humidity on membrane properties, namely increased stiffness and
uniformity with increasing polymer concentration and humidity variations in
pore morphology and mechanical response. The developed automated platform
supports high-throughput experimentation and is well-suited for integration
into self-driving laboratory workflows, offering a scalable and reproducible
foundation for data-driven optimization of porous polymeric membranes through
NIPS.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel robust online calibration framework for
Ultra-Wideband (UWB) anchors in UWB-aided Visual-Inertial Navigation Systems
(VINS). Accurate anchor positioning, a process known as calibration, is crucial
for integrating UWB ranging measurements into state estimation. While several
prior works have demonstrated satisfactory results by using robot-aided systems
to autonomously calibrate UWB systems, there are still some limitations: 1)
these approaches assume accurate robot localization during the initialization
step, ignoring localization errors that can compromise calibration robustness,
and 2) the calibration results are highly sensitive to the initial guess of the
UWB anchors' positions, reducing the practical applicability of these methods
in real-world scenarios. Our approach addresses these challenges by explicitly
incorporating the impact of robot localization uncertainties into the
calibration process, ensuring robust initialization. To further enhance the
robustness of the calibration results against initialization errors, we propose
a tightly-coupled Schmidt Kalman Filter (SKF)-based online refinement method,
making the system suitable for practical applications. Simulations and
real-world experiments validate the improved accuracy and robustness of our
approach.

Abstract: We present 3D FlowMatch Actor (3DFA), a 3D policy architecture for robot

pretrained visual scene representations for learning from demonstration. 3DFA
leverages 3D relative attention between action and visual tokens during action
denoising, building on prior work in 3D diffusion-based single-arm policy
learning. Through a combination of flow matching and targeted system-level and
architectural optimizations, 3DFA achieves over 30x faster training and
inference than previous 3D diffusion-based policies, without sacrificing
performance. On the bimanual PerAct2 benchmark, it establishes a new state of
the art, outperforming the next-best method by an absolute margin of 41.4%. In
extensive real-world evaluations, it surpasses strong baselines with up to
1000x more parameters and significantly more pretraining. In unimanual
settings, it sets a new state of the art on 74 RLBench tasks by directly

Conclusion: GenFlowRL能够有效利用生成的物体中心流，提升策略的通用性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Recent advances have shown that video generation models can enhance robot
learning by deriving effective robot actions through inverse dynamics. However,
these methods heavily depend on the quality of generated data and struggle with
fine-grained manipulation due to the lack of environment feedback. While
video-based reinforcement learning improves policy robustness, it remains
constrained by the uncertainty of video generation and the challenges of
collecting large-scale robot datasets for training diffusion models. To address
these limitations, we propose GenFlowRL, which derives shaped rewards from
generated flow trained from diverse cross-embodiment datasets. This enables
learning generalizable and robust policies from diverse demonstrations using
low-dimensional, object-centric features. Experiments on 10 manipulation tasks,
both in simulation and real-world cross-embodiment evaluations, demonstrate
that GenFlowRL effectively leverages manipulation features extracted from
generated object-centric flow, consistently achieving superior performance
across diverse and challenging scenarios. Our Project Page:

Abstract: Human-robot collaboration requires robots to quickly infer user intent,
provide transparent reasoning, and assist users in achieving their goals. Our
recent work introduced GUIDER, our framework for inferring navigation and
manipulation intents. We propose augmenting GUIDER with a vision-language model
(VLM) and a text-only language model (LLM) to form a semantic prior that
filters objects and locations based on the mission prompt. A vision pipeline
(YOLO for object detection and the Segment Anything Model for instance
segmentation) feeds candidate object crops into the VLM, which scores their
relevance given an operator prompt; in addition, the list of detected object
labels is ranked by a text-only LLM. These scores weight the existing
navigation and manipulation layers of GUIDER, selecting context-relevant
targets while suppressing unrelated objects. Once the combined belief exceeds a
threshold, autonomy changes occur, enabling the robot to navigate to the
desired area and retrieve the desired object, while adapting to any changes in
the operator's intent. Future work will evaluate the system on Isaac Sim using
a Franka Emika arm on a Ridgeback base, with a focus on real-time assistance.

Abstract: Current vision-based robotics simulation benchmarks have significantly
advanced robotic manipulation research. However, robotics is fundamentally a
real-world problem, and evaluation for real-world applications has lagged
behind in evaluating generalist policies. In this paper, we discuss challenges
and desiderata in designing benchmarks for generalist robotic manipulation
policies for the goal of sim-to-real policy transfer. We propose 1) utilizing
high visual-fidelity simulation for improved sim-to-real transfer, 2)
evaluating policies by systematically increasing task complexity and scenario
perturbation to assess robustness, and 3) quantifying performance alignment
between real-world performance and its simulation counterparts.

Conclusion: 该方法通过几何感知安全约束和动态环境处理，显著提升了腿式机器人在复杂环境中的安全导航能力。

Abstract: Autonomous navigation through unstructured and dynamically-changing
environments is a complex task that continues to present many challenges for
modern roboticists. In particular, legged robots typically possess manipulable
asymmetric geometries which must be considered during safety-critical
trajectory planning. This work proposes a predictive safety filter: a nonlinear
model predictive control (MPC) algorithm for online trajectory generation with
geometry-aware safety constraints based on control barrier functions (CBFs).
Critically, our method leverages Poisson safety functions to numerically
synthesize CBF constraints directly from perception data. We extend the
theoretical framework for Poisson safety functions to incorporate temporal
changes in the domain by reformulating the static Dirichlet problem for
Poisson's equation as a parameterized moving boundary value problem.
Furthermore, we employ Minkowski set operations to lift the domain into a
configuration space that accounts for robot geometry. Finally, we implement our
real-time predictive safety filter on humanoid and quadruped robots in various
safety-critical scenarios. The results highlight the versatility of Poisson
safety functions, as well as the benefit of CBF constrained model predictive
safety-critical controllers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法在长时程稀疏奖励的机器人操作任务中表现不佳，直接学习连续动作块存在稳定性和数据效率问题。

Method: AC3结合了非对称更新规则训练actor，仅从成功轨迹学习；critic通过n步回报和自监督模块增强稳定性。

Result: 在BiGym和RLBench的25个任务中，AC3仅需少量演示和简单架构即实现高成功率。

Conclusion: AC3通过有效设计，显著提升了长时程稀疏奖励任务的性能。

Abstract: Existing reinforcement learning (RL) methods struggle with long-horizon
robotic manipulation tasks, particularly those involving sparse rewards. While
action chunking is a promising paradigm for robotic manipulation, using RL to
directly learn continuous action chunks in a stable and data-efficient manner
remains a critical challenge. This paper introduces AC3 (Actor-Critic for
Continuous Chunks), a novel RL framework that learns to generate
high-dimensional, continuous action sequences. To make this learning process
stable and data-efficient, AC3 incorporates targeted stabilization mechanisms
for both the actor and the critic. First, to ensure reliable policy
improvement, the actor is trained with an asymmetric update rule, learning
exclusively from successful trajectories. Second, to enable effective value
learning despite sparse rewards, the critic's update is stabilized using
intra-chunk $n$-step returns and further enriched by a self-supervised module
providing intrinsic rewards at anchor points aligned with each action chunk. We
conducted extensive experiments on 25 tasks from the BiGym and RLBench
benchmarks. Results show that by using only a few demonstrations and a simple
model architecture, AC3 achieves superior success rates on most tasks,
validating its effective design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动化手术抓取任务可减轻外科医生负担，但现有方法依赖物体姿态跟踪或手工特征，泛化性和鲁棒性不足。

Result: 实验显示策略在真实环境中成功率达65%，能泛化到未见物体和夹持器，适应多种干扰。

Conclusion: GASv2展示了高性能、泛化性和鲁棒性，为手术机器人抓取任务提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Grasping is a fundamental task in robot-assisted surgery (RAS), and
automating it can reduce surgeon workload while enhancing efficiency, safety,
and consistency beyond teleoperated systems. Most prior approaches rely on
explicit object pose tracking or handcrafted visual features, limiting their
generalization to novel objects, robustness to visual disturbances, and the
ability to handle deformable objects. Visuomotor learning offers a promising
alternative, but deploying it in RAS presents unique challenges, such as low
signal-to-noise ratio in visual observations, demands for high safety and
millimeter-level precision, as well as the complex surgical environment. This
paper addresses three key challenges: (i) sim-to-real transfer of visuomotor
policies to ex vivo surgical scenes, (ii) visuomotor learning using only a
single stereo camera pair -- the standard RAS setup, and (iii) object-agnostic
grasping with a single policy that generalizes to diverse, unseen surgical
objects without retraining or task-specific models. We introduce Grasp Anything
for Surgery V2 (GASv2), a visuomotor learning framework for surgical grasping.
GASv2 leverages a world-model-based architecture and a surgical perception
pipeline for visual observations, combined with a hybrid control system for
safe execution. We train the policy in simulation using domain randomization
for sim-to-real transfer and deploy it on a real robot in both phantom-based
and ex vivo surgical settings, using only a single pair of endoscopic cameras.
Extensive experiments show our policy achieves a 65% success rate in both
settings, generalizes to unseen objects and grippers, and adapts to diverse
disturbances, demonstrating strong performance, generality, and robustness.

Result: 通过仿真和真实机器人实验验证了方法的有效性，显著提升了采样效率。

Conclusion: 非等距对称性结构和MEA方法为视觉运动学习的效率提升提供了新思路。

Abstract: Sampling efficiency is critical for deploying visuomotor learning in
real-world robotic manipulation. While task symmetry has emerged as a promising
inductive bias to improve efficiency, most prior work is limited to isometric
symmetries -- applying the same group transformation to all task objects across
all timesteps. In this work, we explore non-isometric symmetries, applying
multiple independent group transformations across spatial and temporal
dimensions to relax these constraints. We introduce a novel formulation of the
partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) that incorporates the
non-isometric symmetry structures, and propose a simple yet effective data
augmentation method, Multi-Group Equivariance Augmentation (MEA). We integrate
MEA with offline reinforcement learning to enhance sampling efficiency, and
introduce a voxel-based visual representation that preserves translational
equivariance. Extensive simulation and real-robot experiments across two
manipulation domains demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Conclusion: NEEI通过联合优化EEI和NFC，为具身人工智能提供了高效、安全的通信解决方案。

Abstract: Realizing embodied artificial intelligence is challenging due to the huge
computation demands of large models (LMs). To support LMs while ensuring
real-time inference, embodied edge intelligence (EEI) is a promising paradigm,
which leverages an LM edge to provide computing powers in close proximity to
embodied robots. Due to embodied data exchange, EEI requires higher spectral
efficiency, enhanced communication security, and reduced inter-user
interference. To meet these requirements, near-field communication (NFC), which
leverages extremely large antenna arrays as its hardware foundation, is an
ideal solution. Therefore, this paper advocates the integration of EEI and NFC,
resulting in a near-field EEI (NEEI) paradigm. However, NEEI also introduces
new challenges that cannot be adequately addressed by isolated EEI or NFC
designs, creating research opportunities for joint optimization of both
functionalities. To this end, we propose radio-friendly embodied planning for
EEI-assisted NFC scenarios and view-guided beam-focusing for NFC-assisted EEI
scenarios. We also elaborate how to realize resource-efficient NEEI through
opportunistic collaborative navigation. Experimental results are provided to
confirm the superiority of the proposed techniques compared with various
benchmarks.

Abstract: Robotics research has long sought to give robots the ability to perceive the
physical world through touch in an analogous manner to many biological systems.
Developing such tactile capabilities is important for numerous emerging
applications that require robots to co-exist and interact closely with humans.
Consequently, there has been growing interest in tactile sensing, leading to
the development of various technologies, including piezoresistive and
piezoelectric sensors, capacitive sensors, magnetic sensors, and optical
tactile sensors. These diverse approaches utilise different transduction
methods and materials to equip robots with distributed sensing capabilities,
enabling more effective physical interactions. These advances have been
supported in recent years by simulation tools that generate large-scale tactile
datasets to support sensor designs and algorithms to interpret and improve the
utility of tactile data. The integration of tactile sensing with other
modalities, such as vision, as well as with action strategies for active
tactile perception highlights the growing scope of this field. To further the
transformative progress in tactile robotics, a holistic approach is essential.
In this outlook article, we examine several challenges associated with the
current state of the art in tactile robotics and explore potential solutions to
inspire innovations across multiple domains, including manufacturing,
healthcare, recycling and agriculture.

Conclusion: 可微分可达性地图为复杂人形机器人运动规划提供了一种高效且灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: To reduce the computational cost of humanoid motion generation, we introduce
a new approach to representing robot kinematic reachability: the differentiable
reachability map. This map is a scalar-valued function defined in the task
space that takes positive values only in regions reachable by the robot's
end-effector. A key feature of this representation is that it is continuous and
differentiable with respect to task-space coordinates, enabling its direct use
as constraints in continuous optimization for humanoid motion planning. We
describe a method to learn such differentiable reachability maps from a set of
end-effector poses generated using a robot's kinematic model, using either a
neural network or a support vector machine as the learning model. By
incorporating the learned reachability map as a constraint, we formulate
humanoid motion generation as a continuous optimization problem. We demonstrate
that the proposed approach efficiently solves various motion planning problems,
including footstep planning, multi-contact motion planning, and
loco-manipulation planning for humanoid robots.

Conclusion: 提出的主动重规划框架有效预防执行失败，为机器人自主性提供了更鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: When humans perform everyday tasks, we naturally adjust our actions based on
the current state of the environment. For instance, if we intend to put
something into a drawer but notice it is closed, we open it first. However,
many autonomous robots lack this adaptive awareness. They often follow
pre-planned actions that may overlook subtle yet critical changes in the scene,
which can result in actions being executed under outdated assumptions and
eventual failure. While replanning is critical for robust autonomy, most
existing methods respond only after failures occur, when recovery may be
inefficient or infeasible. While proactive replanning holds promise for
preventing failures in advance, current solutions often rely on manually
designed rules and extensive supervision. In this work, we present a proactive
replanning framework that detects and corrects failures at subtask boundaries
by comparing scene graphs constructed from current RGB-D observations against
reference graphs extracted from successful demonstrations. When the current
scene fails to align with reference trajectories, a lightweight reasoning
module is activated to diagnose the mismatch and adjust the plan. Experiments
in the AI2-THOR simulator demonstrate that our approach detects semantic and
spatial mismatches before execution failures occur, significantly improving
task success and robustness.

Conclusion: RTLS结合环绕控制器显著提升了仅方位TMA的精度和稳定性。

Abstract: Bearing-only Target Motion Analysis (TMA) is a promising technique for
passive tracking in various applications as a bearing angle is easy to measure.
Despite its advantages, bearing-only TMA is challenging due to the nonlinearity
of the bearing measurement model and the lack of range information, which
impairs observability and estimator convergence. This paper addresses these
issues by proposing a Recursive Total Least Squares (RTLS) method for online
target localization and tracking using mobile observers. The RTLS approach,
inspired by previous results on Total Least Squares (TLS), mitigates biases in
position estimation and improves computational efficiency compared to
pseudo-linear Kalman filter (PLKF) methods. Additionally, we propose a
circumnavigation controller to enhance system observability and estimator
convergence by guiding the mobile observer in orbit around the target.
Extensive simulations and experiments are performed to demonstrate the
effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method. The proposed algorithm is
also compared with the state-of-the-art approaches, which confirms its superior
performance in terms of both accuracy and stability.

Conclusion: EvoPSF通过在线进化机制增强了自动驾驶系统对动态环境的适应性和规划准确性。

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed remarkable progress in autonomous driving, with
systems evolving from modular pipelines to end-to-end architectures. However,
most existing methods are trained offline and lack mechanisms to adapt to new
environments during deployment. As a result, their generalization ability
diminishes when faced with unseen variations in real-world driving scenarios.
In this paper, we break away from the conventional "train once, deploy forever"
paradigm and propose EvoPSF, a novel online Evolution framework for autonomous
driving based on Planning-State Feedback. We argue that planning failures are
primarily caused by inaccurate object-level motion predictions, and such
failures are often reflected in the form of increased planner uncertainty. To
address this, we treat planner uncertainty as a trigger for online evolution,
using it as a diagnostic signal to initiate targeted model updates. Rather than
performing blind updates, we leverage the planner's agent-agent attention to
identify the specific objects that the ego vehicle attends to most, which are
primarily responsible for the planning failures. For these critical objects, we
compute a targeted self-supervised loss by comparing their predicted waypoints
from the prediction module with their actual future positions, selected from
the perception module's outputs with high confidence scores. This loss is then
backpropagated to adapt the model online. As a result, our method improves the
model's robustness to environmental changes, leads to more precise motion
predictions, and therefore enables more accurate and stable planning behaviors.
Experiments on both cross-region and corrupted variants of the nuScenes dataset
demonstrate that EvoPSF consistently improves planning performance under
challenging conditions.

Motivation: 现有端到端策略在小规模模拟器数据集上过拟合，泛化能力差且行为不安全（频繁碰撞）。

Method: OVSegDT包含语义分支（目标二值掩码编码器和辅助分割损失函数）和熵自适应损失调制（动态平衡模仿与强化信号）。

Result: 训练样本复杂度降低33%，碰撞次数减少一半，在未见类别上性能与已见类别相当（40.1% SR，20.9% SPL）。

Conclusion: OVSegDT在无需深度、里程计或大型视觉语言模型的情况下，实现了开放词汇目标导航的最先进性能。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary Object Goal Navigation requires an embodied agent to reach
objects described by free-form language, including categories never seen during
training. Existing end-to-end policies overfit small simulator datasets,
achieving high success on training scenes but failing to generalize and
exhibiting unsafe behaviour (frequent collisions). We introduce OVSegDT, a
lightweight transformer policy that tackles these issues with two synergistic
components. The first component is the semantic branch, which includes an
encoder for the target binary mask and an auxiliary segmentation loss function,
grounding the textual goal and providing precise spatial cues. The second
component consists of a proposed Entropy-Adaptive Loss Modulation, a per-sample
scheduler that continuously balances imitation and reinforcement signals
according to the policy entropy, eliminating brittle manual phase switches.
These additions cut the sample complexity of training by 33%, and reduce
collision count in two times while keeping inference cost low (130M parameters,
RGB-only input). On HM3D-OVON, our model matches the performance on unseen
categories to that on seen ones and establishes state-of-the-art results (40.1%
SR, 20.9% SPL on val unseen) without depth, odometry, or large vision-language
models. Code is available at https://github.com/CognitiveAISystems/OVSegDT.

TL;DR: i2Nav-Robot是一个大规模多传感器融合数据集，旨在解决UGV导航和地图构建中的传感器配置、时间同步、地面真实性和场景多样性不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前UGV数据集在传感器配置、时间同步、地面真实性和场景多样性方面存在不足，无法满足导航和地图构建技术的需求。

Method: 通过集成多模态传感器（如LiDAR、雷达、相机、里程计、GNSS和IMU），并采用硬件同步和离线校准，构建了一个覆盖室内外多样场景的大规模数据集。

Result: 数据集包含10个大规模序列，总长约17060米，地面真实数据厘米级精度，被多个开源系统验证为高质量。

Conclusion: i2Nav-Robot数据集为UGV导航和地图构建提供了高质量的多传感器数据支持。

Abstract: Accurate and reliable navigation is crucial for autonomous unmanned ground
vehicle (UGV). However, current UGV datasets fall short in meeting the demands
for advancing navigation and mapping techniques due to limitations in sensor
configuration, time synchronization, ground truth, and scenario diversity. To
address these challenges, we present i2Nav-Robot, a large-scale dataset
designed for multi-sensor fusion navigation and mapping in indoor-outdoor
environments. We integrate multi-modal sensors, including the newest front-view
and 360-degree solid-state LiDARs, 4-dimensional (4D) radar, stereo cameras,
odometer, global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receiver, and inertial
measurement units (IMU) on an omnidirectional wheeled robot. Accurate
timestamps are obtained through both online hardware synchronization and
offline calibration for all sensors. The dataset comprises ten larger-scale
sequences covering diverse UGV operating scenarios, such as outdoor streets,
and indoor parking lots, with a total length of about 17060 meters.
High-frequency ground truth, with centimeter-level accuracy for position, is
derived from post-processing integrated navigation methods using a
navigation-grade IMU. The proposed i2Nav-Robot dataset is evaluated by more
than ten open-sourced multi-sensor fusion systems, and it has proven to have
superior data quality.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于极坐标的新方法Polaris，用于自动驾驶中的轨迹预测与规划，优于传统笛卡尔坐标系方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在笛卡尔坐标系中建模车辆与周围交通元素的关系不够直观，无法有效捕捉距离和方向的影响。

Method: 采用极坐标系统（半径和角度表示位置），通过专用编码和细化模块显式建模距离和方向变化。

Result: 在Argoverse 2和nuPlan基准测试中，Polaris实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 极坐标表示能更直观地建模空间关系和相对影响，提升轨迹预测与规划效果。

Abstract: Trajectory prediction and planning in autonomous driving are highly
challenging due to the complexity of predicting surrounding agents' movements
and planning the ego agent's actions in dynamic environments. Existing methods
encode map and agent positions and decode future trajectories in Cartesian
coordinates. However, modeling the relationships between the ego vehicle and
surrounding traffic elements in Cartesian space can be suboptimal, as it does
not naturally capture the varying influence of different elements based on
their relative distances and directions. To address this limitation, we adopt
the Polar coordinate system, where positions are represented by radius and
angle. This representation provides a more intuitive and effective way to model
spatial changes and relative relationships, especially in terms of distance and
directional influence. Based on this insight, we propose Polaris, a novel
method that operates entirely in Polar coordinates, distinguishing itself from
conventional Cartesian-based approaches. By leveraging the Polar
representation, this method explicitly models distance and direction variations
and captures relative relationships through dedicated encoding and refinement
modules, enabling more structured and spatially aware trajectory prediction and
planning. Extensive experiments on the challenging prediction (Argoverse 2) and
planning benchmarks (nuPlan) demonstrate that Polaris achieves state-of-the-art
performance.

Abstract: Reliable autonomous navigation across the unstructured terrains of distant
planetary surfaces is a critical enabler for future space exploration. However,
the deployment of learning-based controllers is hindered by the inherent
sim-to-real gap, particularly for the complex dynamics of wheel interactions
with granular media. This work presents a complete sim-to-real framework for
developing and validating robust control policies for dynamic waypoint tracking
on such challenging surfaces. We leverage massively parallel simulation to
train reinforcement learning agents across a vast distribution of procedurally
generated environments with randomized physics. These policies are then
transferred zero-shot to a physical wheeled rover operating in a lunar-analogue
facility. Our experiments systematically compare multiple reinforcement
learning algorithms and action smoothing filters to identify the most effective
combinations for real-world deployment. Crucially, we provide strong empirical
evidence that agents trained with procedural diversity achieve superior
zero-shot performance compared to those trained on static scenarios. We also
analyze the trade-offs of fine-tuning with high-fidelity particle physics,
which offers minor gains in low-speed precision at a significant computational
cost. Together, these contributions establish a validated workflow for creating
reliable learning-based navigation systems, marking a critical step towards
deploying autonomous robots in the final frontier.

Conclusion: 研究为敏捷全身运动生成中浮基表示的选择提供了实用见解。

Abstract: Automatically generating agile whole-body motions for legged and humanoid
robots remains a fundamental challenge in robotics. While numerous trajectory
optimization approaches have been proposed, there is no clear guideline on how
the choice of floating-base space parameterization affects performance,
especially for agile behaviors involving complex contact dynamics. In this
paper, we present a comparative study of different parameterizations for direct
transcription-based trajectory optimization of agile motions in legged systems.
We systematically evaluate several common choices under identical optimization
settings to ensure a fair comparison. Furthermore, we introduce a novel
formulation based on the tangent space of SE(3) for representing the robot's
floating-base pose, which, to our knowledge, has not received attention from
the literature. This approach enables the use of mature off-the-shelf numerical
solvers without requiring specialized manifold optimization techniques. We hope
that our experiments and analysis will provide meaningful insights for
selecting the appropriate floating-based representation for agile whole-body
motion generation.

TL;DR: 论文提出MultiPark，一种基于自回归Transformer的多模态停车方法，解决了现有模仿学习在停车行为中的多模态性和因果混淆问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 停车在高度受限空间中的准确性和安全性是重要挑战，现有模仿学习方法未能处理停车行为的多模态性且存在因果混淆问题。

Method: 采用数据高效的下一段预测范式处理急转弯路径，设计可学习的停车查询分解为档位、纵向和横向组件，并行解码多种停车行为，并使用目标中心位姿和自我中心碰撞作为损失。

Result: 在真实数据集上评估显示MultiPark在多种场景中达到最优性能，并在实际车辆部署中验证了其鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MultiPark通过多模态处理和因果混淆缓解，显著提升了复杂停车场景下的性能。

Abstract: Parking accurately and safely in highly constrained spaces remains a critical
challenge. Unlike structured driving environments, parking requires executing
complex maneuvers such as frequent gear shifts and steering saturation. Recent
attempts to employ imitation learning (IL) for parking have achieved promising
results. However, existing works ignore the multimodal nature of parking
behavior in lane-free open space, failing to derive multiple plausible
solutions under the same situation. Notably, IL-based methods encompass
inherent causal confusion, so enabling a neural network to generalize across
diverse parking scenarios is particularly difficult. To address these
challenges, we propose MultiPark, an autoregressive transformer for multimodal
parking. To handle paths filled with abrupt turning points, we introduce a
data-efficient next-segment prediction paradigm, enabling spatial
generalization and temporal extrapolation. Furthermore, we design learnable
parking queries factorized into gear, longitudinal, and lateral components,
parallelly decoding diverse parking behaviors. To mitigate causal confusion in
IL, our method employs target-centric pose and ego-centric collision as
outcome-oriented loss across all modalities beyond pure imitation loss.
Evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate that MultiPark achieves
state-of-the-art performance across various scenarios. We deploy MultiPark on a
production vehicle, further confirming our approach's robustness in real-world
parking environments.

Result: 仿真显示性能接近基于真实测量的控制，仅轻微下降（<6%），且对负载参数变化具有强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 框架在户外环境中验证了实用性和可靠性，仅需现成硬件。

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of tracking the position of a
cable-suspended payload carried by an unmanned aerial vehicle, with a focus on
real-world deployment and minimal hardware requirements. In contrast to many
existing approaches that rely on motion-capture systems, additional onboard
cameras, or instrumented payloads, we propose a framework that uses only
standard onboard sensors--specifically, real-time kinematic global navigation
satellite system measurements and data from the onboard inertial measurement
unit--to estimate and control the payload's position. The system models the
full coupled dynamics of the aerial vehicle and payload, and integrates a
linear Kalman filter for state estimation, a model predictive contouring
control planner, and an incremental model predictive controller. The control
architecture is designed to remain effective despite sensing limitations and
estimation uncertainty. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed
system achieves performance comparable to control based on ground-truth
measurements, with only minor degradation (< 6%). The system also shows strong
robustness to variations in payload parameters. Field experiments further
validate the framework, confirming its practical applicability and reliable
performance in outdoor environments using only off-the-shelf aerial vehicle
hardware.

Motivation: 研究动机是解决农业喷雾中复杂动态过程和不确定性因素（如风速、喷嘴堵塞等）带来的挑战，寻找更简单、低成本的替代方案。

Method: 方法包括比较三种分段设置（48段、2段和单段控制），结合两种路径规划和喷雾切换逻辑，并在10个实际农田场景中评估。

Result: 结果表明，优选方法能最小化路径长度、提供中等重叠，适合手动驾驶且无需传感器。

Conclusion: 结论是简化的一或两段预测喷雾切换方法在低成本和无传感器需求下表现更优。

Abstract: Automatic Section Control (ASC) is a long-standing trend for spraying in
agriculture. It promises to minimise spray overlap areas. The core idea is to
(i) switch off spray nozzles on areas that have already been sprayed, and (ii)
to dynamically adjust nozzle flow rates along the boom bar that holds the spray
nozzles when velocities of boom sections vary during turn maneuvers. ASC is not
possible without sensors, in particular for accurate positioning data. Spraying
and the movement of modern wide boom bars are highly dynamic processes. In
addition, many uncertainty factors have an effect such as cross wind drift,
boom height, nozzle clogging in open-field conditions, and so forth. In view of
this complexity, the natural question arises if a simpler alternative exist.
Therefore, an Automatic Multi-Sections Control method is compared to a proposed
simpler one- or two-sections alternative that uses predictive spray switching.
The comparison is provided under nominal conditions. Agricultural spraying is
intrinsically linked to area coverage path planning and spray switching logic.
Combinations of two area coverage path planning and switching logics as well as
three sections-setups are compared. The three sections-setups differ by
controlling 48 sections, 2 sections or controlling all nozzles uniformly with
the same control signal as one single section. Methods are evaluated on 10
diverse real-world field examples, including non-convex field contours,
freeform mainfield lanes and multiple obstacle areas. A preferred method is
suggested that (i) minimises area coverage pathlength, (ii) offers intermediate
overlap, (iii) is suitable for manual driving by following a pre-planned
predictive spray switching logic for an area coverage path plan, and (iv) and
in contrast to ASC can be implemented sensor-free and therefore at low cost.

Conclusion: VPEngine通过高效GPU利用和动态任务优先级调整，为机器人社区提供了一个开源、易用的实时视觉多任务处理框架。

Abstract: Deploying multiple machine learning models on resource-constrained robotic
platforms for different perception tasks often results in redundant
computations, large memory footprints, and complex integration challenges. In
response, this work presents Visual Perception Engine (VPEngine), a modular
framework designed to enable efficient GPU usage for visual multitasking while
maintaining extensibility and developer accessibility. Our framework
architecture leverages a shared foundation model backbone that extracts image
representations, which are efficiently shared, without any unnecessary GPU-CPU
memory transfers, across multiple specialized task-specific model heads running
in parallel. This design eliminates the computational redundancy inherent in
feature extraction component when deploying traditional sequential models while
enabling dynamic task prioritization based on application demands. We
demonstrate our framework's capabilities through an example implementation
using DINOv2 as the foundation model with multiple task (depth, object
detection and semantic segmentation) heads, achieving up to 3x speedup compared
to sequential execution. Building on CUDA Multi-Process Service (MPS), VPEngine
offers efficient GPU utilization and maintains a constant memory footprint
while allowing per-task inference frequencies to be adjusted dynamically during
runtime. The framework is written in Python and is open source with ROS2 C++
(Humble) bindings for ease of use by the robotics community across diverse
robotic platforms. Our example implementation demonstrates end-to-end real-time
performance at $\geq$50 Hz on NVIDIA Jetson Orin AGX for TensorRT optimized
models.

Conclusion: 该分类器能实时反馈并规划纠正动作，显著提升采摘效率和可靠性。

Abstract: Effective and efficient agricultural manipulation and harvesting depend on
accurately understanding the current state of the grasp. The agricultural
environment presents unique challenges due to its complexity, clutter, and
occlusion. Additionally, fruit is physically attached to the plant, requiring
precise separation during harvesting. Selecting appropriate sensors and
modeling techniques is critical for obtaining reliable feedback and correctly
identifying grasp states. This work investigates a set of key sensors, namely
inertial measurement units (IMUs), infrared (IR) reflectance, tension, tactile
sensors, and RGB cameras, integrated into a compliant gripper to classify grasp
states. We evaluate the individual contribution of each sensor and compare the
performance of two widely used classification models: Random Forest and Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. Our results demonstrate that a Random Forest
classifier, trained in a controlled lab environment and tested on real cherry
tomato plants, achieved 100% accuracy in identifying slip, grasp failure, and
successful picks, marking a substantial improvement over baseline performance.
Furthermore, we identify a minimal viable sensor combination, namely IMU and
tension sensors that effectively classifies grasp states. This classifier
enables the planning of corrective actions based on real-time feedback, thereby
enhancing the efficiency and reliability of fruit harvesting operations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何在低拉伸条件下使用尽可能少的树覆盖度量空间，特别是解决两棵树是否能实现恒定拉伸的问题。

Method: 通过一种简单的Steiner构造，实现了拉伸分析为√26的两棵树覆盖，并可以修剪Steiner点以进一步优化。

Result: 证明了在欧几里得平面上，两棵树可以实现恒定拉伸，拉伸分析为√26，且最大度数有限。

Conclusion: 该方法为近似距离问题提供了从欧几里得平面到两棵树的简单有效工具，具有潜在的应用价值。

Abstract: A {$t$-stretch tree cover} of a metric space $M = (X,\delta)$, for a
parameter $t \ge 1$, is a collection of trees such that every pair of points
has a $t$-stretch path in one of the trees. Tree covers provide an important
sketching tool that has found various applications over the years. The
celebrated {Dumbbell Theorem} by Arya et al. [STOC'95] states that any set of
points in the Euclidean plane admits a $(1+\epsilon)$-stretch tree cover with
$O_\epsilon(1)$ trees. This result extends to any (constant) dimension and was
also generalized for arbitrary doubling metrics by Bartal et al. [ICALP'19].
  Although the number of trees provided by the Dumbbell Theorem is constant,
this constant is not small, even for a stretch significantly larger than
$1+\epsilon$. At the other extreme, any single tree on the vertices of a
regular $n$-polygon must incur a stretch of $\Omega(n)$. Using known results of
ultrametric embeddings, one can easily get a stretch of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{n})$
using two trees. The question of whether a low stretch can be achieved using
two trees has remained illusive, even in the Euclidean plane.
  In this work, we resolve this fundamental question in the affirmative by
presenting a constant-stretch cover with a pair of trees, for any set of points
in the Euclidean plane. Our main technical contribution is a {surprisingly
simple} Steiner construction, for which we provide a {tight} stretch analysis
of $\sqrt{26}$. The Steiner points can be easily pruned if one is willing to
increase the stretch by a small constant. Moreover, we can bound the maximum
degree of the construction by a constant.
  Our result thus provides a simple yet effective reduction tool -- for
problems that concern approximate distances -- from the Euclidean plane to a
pair of trees. To demonstrate the potential power of this tool, we present some
applications [...]

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在加倍度量中是否可以实现与欧几里得空间相同的(1+ε)-spanner最优性。

Method: 通过分析欧几里得空间中的锥分割方法和加倍度量中的网树spanner构造。

Result: 证明在加倍度量中无法实现欧几里得空间中的最优边数和轻量级，网树spanner及其修剪版本均为最优。

Conclusion: 加倍度量中的spanner构造无法达到欧几里得空间的最优性，网树spanner已是最优解。

Abstract: Any $n$-point set in the $d$-dimensional Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^d$, for
$d = O(1)$, admits a $(1+\epsilon)$-spanner with $\tilde{O}(n \cdot
\epsilon^{-d+1})$ edges and lightness $\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-d})$, for any
$\epsilon > 0$. (The {lightness} is a normalized notion of weight, where we
divide the spanner weight by the MST weight. The $\tilde{O}$ and
$\tilde{\Omega}$ notations hide $\texttt{polylog}(\epsilon^{-1})$ terms.)
Moreover, this result is tight: For any $2 \le d = O(1)$, there exists an
$n$-point set in $\mathbb{R}^d$, for which any $(1+\epsilon)$-spanner has
$\tilde{\Omega}(n \cdot \epsilon^{-d+1})$ edges and lightness $\tilde{\Omega}(n
\cdot \epsilon^{-d})$.
  The upper bounds for Euclidean spanners rely heavily on the spatial property
of {cone partitioning} in $\mathbb{R}^d$, which does not seem to extend to the
wider family of {doubling metrics}, i.e., metric spaces of constant {doubling
dimension}. In doubling metrics, a {simple spanner construction from two
decades ago, the {net-tree spanner}}, has $\tilde{O}(n \cdot \epsilon^{-d})$
edges, and it could be transformed into a spanner of lightness $\tilde{O}(n
\cdot \epsilon^{-(d+1)})$ by pruning redundant edges. Despite a large body of
work, it has remained an open question whether the superior Euclidean bounds of
$\tilde{O}(n \cdot \epsilon^{-d+1})$ edges and lightness
$\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-d})$ could be achieved also in doubling metrics. We
resolve this question in the negative by presenting a surprisingly simple and
tight lower bound, which shows, in particular, that the net-tree spanner and
its pruned version are both optimal.

Result: 在内容无关和内容感知布局生成任务中，生成更高质量的布局。

Conclusion: LayoutRectifier无需额外训练即可提升学习型布局生成方法的效果。

Abstract: Recent deep learning methods can generate diverse graphic design layouts
efficiently. However, these methods often create layouts with flaws, such as
misalignment, unwanted overlaps, and unsatisfied containment. To tackle this
issue, we propose an optimization-based method called LayoutRectifier, which
gracefully rectifies auto-generated graphic design layouts to reduce these
flaws while minimizing deviation from the generated layout. The core of our
method is a two-stage optimization. First, we utilize grid systems, which
professional designers commonly use to organize elements, to mitigate
misalignments through discrete search. Second, we introduce a novel box
containment function designed to adjust the positions and sizes of the layout
elements, preventing unwanted overlapping and promoting desired containment. We
evaluate our method on content-agnostic and content-aware layout generation
tasks and achieve better-quality layouts that are more suitable for downstream
graphic design tasks. Our method complements learning-based layout generation
methods and does not require additional training.

Conclusion: StyleMM能够高效生成风格化3D人脸网格，具有一致性和可动画性。

Abstract: We introduce StyleMM, a novel framework that can construct a stylized 3D
Morphable Model (3DMM) based on user-defined text descriptions specifying a
target style. Building upon a pre-trained mesh deformation network and a
texture generator for original 3DMM-based realistic human faces, our approach
fine-tunes these models using stylized facial images generated via text-guided
image-to-image (i2i) translation with a diffusion model, which serve as
stylization targets for the rendered mesh. To prevent undesired changes in
identity, facial alignment, or expressions during i2i translation, we introduce
a stylization method that explicitly preserves the facial attributes of the
source image. By maintaining these critical attributes during image
stylization, the proposed approach ensures consistent 3D style transfer across
the 3DMM parameter space through image-based training. Once trained, StyleMM
enables feed-forward generation of stylized face meshes with explicit control
over shape, expression, and texture parameters, producing meshes with
consistent vertex connectivity and animatability. Quantitative and qualitative
evaluations demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods
in terms of identity-level facial diversity and stylization capability. The

Motivation: 尽管现有的文本到图像扩散模型在生成与文本提示对齐的图像方面表现优异，但控制输出图像的视觉风格仍具挑战性。

Method: SPG通过构建风格噪声向量，并利用其与无条件噪声的方向偏差引导扩散过程朝向目标风格分布。

Result: 实验表明，SPG在风格一致性方面优于现有方法，且兼容ControlNet和IPAdapter等可控框架。

Conclusion: SPG是一种简单、鲁棒且广泛适用的方法，有效解决了风格控制问题。

Abstract: Although recent text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models excel at aligning
generated images with textual prompts, controlling the visual style of the
output remains a challenging task. In this work, we propose Style-Prompting
Guidance (SPG), a novel sampling strategy for style-specific image generation.
SPG constructs a style noise vector and leverages its directional deviation
from unconditional noise to guide the diffusion process toward the target style
distribution. By integrating SPG with Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG), our
method achieves both semantic fidelity and style consistency. SPG is simple,
robust, and compatible with controllable frameworks like ControlNet and
IPAdapter, making it practical and widely applicable. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of our approach compared to
state-of-the-art methods. Code is available at
