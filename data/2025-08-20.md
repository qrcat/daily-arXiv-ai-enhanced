### [1] [YOLO11-CR: a Lightweight Convolution-and-Attention Framework for Accurate Fatigue Driving Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13205)
*Zhebin Jin,Ligang Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出YOLO11-CR轻量级目标检测模型，用于实时疲劳检测，通过CAFM和RCM模块提升特征表达和空间定位能力，在DSM数据集上表现优异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有疲劳检测方法存在侵入性、硬件依赖或小目标检测效果差的问题，需要开发非侵入式、实时且准确的方法来减少交通事故

Method: YOLO11-CR模型包含卷积与注意力融合模块(CAFM)整合CNN局部特征和Transformer全局上下文，以及矩形校准模块(RCM)捕获水平和垂直上下文信息

Result: 在DSM数据集上达到87.17%精确率、83.86%召回率、88.09% mAP@50和55.93% mAP@50-95，显著优于基线模型

Conclusion: YOLO11-CR为车载疲劳监测提供了实用高效解决方案，具有实际部署潜力，未来可扩展时间建模、多模态数据融合和嵌入式优化

Abstract: Driver fatigue detection is of paramount importance for intelligent
transportation systems due to its critical role in mitigating road traffic
accidents. While physiological and vehicle dynamics-based methods offer
accuracy, they are often intrusive, hardware-dependent, and lack robustness in
real-world environments. Vision-based techniques provide a non-intrusive and
scalable alternative, but still face challenges such as poor detection of small
or occluded objects and limited multi-scale feature modeling. To address these
issues, this paper proposes YOLO11-CR, a lightweight and efficient object
detection model tailored for real-time fatigue detection. YOLO11-CR introduces
two key modules: the Convolution-and-Attention Fusion Module (CAFM), which
integrates local CNN features with global Transformer-based context to enhance
feature expressiveness; and the Rectangular Calibration Module (RCM), which
captures horizontal and vertical contextual information to improve spatial
localization, particularly for profile faces and small objects like mobile
phones. Experiments on the DSM dataset demonstrated that YOLO11-CR achieves a
precision of 87.17%, recall of 83.86%, mAP@50 of 88.09%, and mAP@50-95 of
55.93%, outperforming baseline models significantly. Ablation studies further
validate the effectiveness of the CAFM and RCM modules in improving both
sensitivity and localization accuracy. These results demonstrate that YOLO11-CR
offers a practical and high-performing solution for in-vehicle fatigue
monitoring, with strong potential for real-world deployment and future
enhancements involving temporal modeling, multi-modal data integration, and
embedded optimization.

TL;DR: 提出了Mirage基准和Mirage-R1模型，用于解决真实世界中AI生成图像检测的挑战，相比现有方法在基准测试上提升5-10%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI生成图像检测器在实验室环境下有效，但无法泛化到真实世界的嘈杂场景，这些图像经过多种生成模型和后期编辑处理

Method: 构建Mirage基准数据集（包含互联网来源和合成数据），开发Mirage-R1视觉语言模型，采用启发式到分析式推理机制，两阶段训练（监督微调+强化学习），推理时自适应思考策略

Result: 在Mirage基准和公共基准上分别领先现有最优检测器5%和10%

Conclusion: Mirage基准和Mirage-R1模型有效解决了真实世界AI生成图像检测问题，在性能和推理速度之间取得了良好平衡

Abstract: The spreading of AI-generated images (AIGI), driven by advances in generative
AI, poses a significant threat to information security and public trust.
Existing AIGI detectors, while effective against images in clean laboratory
settings, fail to generalize to in-the-wild scenarios. These real-world images
are noisy, varying from ``obviously fake" images to realistic ones derived from
multiple generative models and further edited for quality control. We address
in-the-wild AIGI detection in this paper. We introduce Mirage, a challenging
benchmark designed to emulate the complexity of in-the-wild AIGI. Mirage is
constructed from two sources: (1) a large corpus of Internet-sourced AIGI
verified by human experts, and (2) a synthesized dataset created through the
collaboration between multiple expert generators, closely simulating the
realistic AIGI in the wild. Building on this benchmark, we propose Mirage-R1, a
vision-language model with heuristic-to-analytic reasoning, a reflective
reasoning mechanism for AIGI detection. Mirage-R1 is trained in two stages: a
supervised-fine-tuning cold start, followed by a reinforcement learning stage.
By further adopting an inference-time adaptive thinking strategy, Mirage-R1 is
able to provide either a quick judgment or a more robust and accurate
conclusion, effectively balancing inference speed and performance. Extensive
experiments show that our model leads state-of-the-art detectors by 5% and 10%
on Mirage and the public benchmark, respectively. The benchmark and code will
be made publicly available.

### [3] [DianJin-OCR-R1: Enhancing OCR Capabilities via a Reasoning-and-Tool Interleaved Vision-Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13238)
*Qian Chen,Xianyin Zhang,Lifan Guo,Feng Chen,Chi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DianJin-OCR-R1是一个推理增强的视觉语言模型框架，通过结合自身OCR能力和专家模型工具来减少幻觉，在OCR任务中表现优于非推理模型和专家模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在文档图像解析中存在幻觉问题，且相比专门训练的专家模型在OCR任务上效果较差。需要一种方法来结合两者的优势，提高OCR性能的同时减少幻觉。

Method: 提出推理-工具交织的VLM框架：模型先自行识别图像内容，然后调用专家模型工具获取参考结果，最后重新审视图像并反思推理过程来提供最终识别结果。

Result: 在ReST和OmniDocBench数据集上的实验表明，DianJin-OCR-R1模型持续优于非推理对应模型和专家OCR模型。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了LVLMs的幻觉问题，通过利用专家模型的优势以较低成本提升了VLM的性能，证明了推理-工具交织方法的有效性。

Abstract: Recent advances in large vision-language models (LVLMs) have enabled a new
paradigm of end-to-end document image parsing, excelling in Optical Character
Recognition (OCR) tasks such as text, table, and formula recognition. However,
generative LVLMs, similarly to large language models (LLMs), are prone to
hallucinations--generating words that do not exist in input images.
Furthermore, LVLMs are designed for general purposes and tend to be less
effective on OCR tasks compared to expert models that are trained on
domain-specific datasets. In this paper, we propose DianJin-OCR-R1, a
reasoning-enhanced framework designed to address these limitations through
training reasoning-and-tool interleaved VLMs. Given a recognition instruction,
our DianJin-OCR-R1 model first recognizes the content in the input image by its
own OCR capabilities, and then calls other tools (i.e., other expert models) to
obtain their results as references, finally looks again the image and rethinks
about the reasoning process to provide the final recognized content. Since
architectures of expert models are tailored for specific OCR tasks, which makes
them less prone to hallucinations, their results can help VLMs mitigate
hallucinations. Additionally, expert models are typically smaller in scale and
easy to iterate, enabling performance improvements for VLMs at a lower cost. We
evaluate our model on ReST and OmniDocBench, and experimental results show that
our DianJin-OCR-R1 models consistently outperform their non-reasoning
counterparts and expert OCR models, which proves the effectiveness of our
method.

*Sumaiya Fazal,Sheeraz Ahmed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 基于卷积神经网络的乌尔都语光学字符识别系统，通过组件分类和自动特征学习实现了高准确率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乌尔都语作为一种手写体语言，具有复杂的几何和形态结构，分割基于的识别方法往往错误率较高，需要更有效的解决方案

Method: 采用卷积神经网络(CNN)进行自动特征学习，通过三个字符的排列组合生成数据集，并使用连通组件技术获取细体，构建了两层层次神经网络来处理不同程度的字符排列组合和组件分类

Result: 模型在组件分类任务上达到了0.99%的高准确率

Conclusion: 组件基于的CNN方法能够有效处理乌尔都语的复杂字符识别问题，为手写体语言的光学字符识别提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Urdu is a cursive script language and has similarities with Arabic and many
other South Asian languages. Urdu is difficult to classify due to its complex
geometrical and morphological structure. Character classification can be
processed further if segmentation technique is efficient, but due to context
sensitivity in Urdu, segmentation-based recognition often results with high
error rate. Our proposed approach for Urdu optical character recognition system
is a component-based classification relying on automatic feature learning
technique called convolutional neural network. CNN is trained and tested on
Urdu text dataset, which is generated through permutation process of three
characters and further proceeds to discarding unnecessary images by applying
connected component technique in order to obtain ligature only. Hierarchical
neural network is implemented with two levels to deal with three degrees of
character permutations and component classification Our model successfully
achieved 0.99% for component classification.

### [5] [CLoE: Curriculum Learning on Endoscopic Images for Robust MES Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13280)
*Zeynep Ozdemir,Hacer Yalim Keles,Omer Ozgur Tanriover*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLoE是一个课程学习框架，通过图像质量评估标签可靠性并结合序数结构，提升溃疡性结肠炎内镜图像MES分类的准确性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mayo内镜评分(MES)分类面临观察者间变异导致的标签噪声问题，且标准模型常忽略评分的序数性质

Method: 使用基于BBPS标签训练的轻量模型估计图像质量作为标注置信度代理，构建从易到难的课程学习，结合ResizeMix增强提升鲁棒性

Result: 在LIMUC和HyperKvasir数据集上，CLoE显著提升CNN和Transformer性能，ConvNeXt-Tiny达到82.5%准确率和0.894 QWK

Conclusion: 难度感知训练策略能有效改善标签不确定性下的序数分类问题

Abstract: Estimating disease severity from endoscopic images is essential in assessing
ulcerative colitis, where the Mayo Endoscopic Subscore (MES) is widely used to
grade inflammation. However, MES classification remains challenging due to
label noise from inter-observer variability and the ordinal nature of the
score, which standard models often ignore. We propose CLoE, a curriculum
learning framework that accounts for both label reliability and ordinal
structure. Image quality, estimated via a lightweight model trained on Boston
Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS) labels, is used as a proxy for annotation
confidence to order samples from easy (clean) to hard (noisy). This curriculum
is further combined with ResizeMix augmentation to improve robustness.
Experiments on the LIMUC and HyperKvasir datasets, using both CNNs and
Transformers, show that CLoE consistently improves performance over strong
supervised and self-supervised baselines. For instance, ConvNeXt-Tiny reaches
82.5\% accuracy and a QWK of 0.894 on LIMUC with low computational cost. These
results highlight the potential of difficulty-aware training strategies for
improving ordinal classification under label uncertainty. Code will be released
at https://github.com/zeynepozdemir/CLoE.

### [6] [GaitCrafter: Diffusion Model for Biometric Preserving Gait Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13300)
*Sirshapan Mitra,Yogesh S. Rawat*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GaitCrafter是一个基于扩散模型的步态序列生成框架，能够在轮廓域合成逼真的步态数据，支持多种条件控制，并能生成新身份数据以保护隐私，提升步态识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 步态识别面临大规模标注数据集缺乏、收集多样化步态样本困难且需保护隐私的挑战，需要一种能够生成高质量可控步态数据的方法。

Method: 提出GaitCrafter框架，从头训练视频扩散模型，专门处理步态轮廓数据，支持基于服装、携带物品、视角等多种条件的可控生成，并通过身份嵌入插值生成新身份。

Result: 合成样本能提升步态识别性能，特别是在挑战性条件下；生成的新身份具有独特一致的步态模式，可用于模型训练同时保护真实对象隐私。

Conclusion: 该工作是利用扩散模型进行高质量、可控且隐私感知的步态数据生成的重要进展，为解决步态识别数据稀缺问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Gait recognition is a valuable biometric task that enables the identification
of individuals from a distance based on their walking patterns. However, it
remains limited by the lack of large-scale labeled datasets and the difficulty
of collecting diverse gait samples for each individual while preserving
privacy. To address these challenges, we propose GaitCrafter, a diffusion-based
framework for synthesizing realistic gait sequences in the silhouette domain.
Unlike prior works that rely on simulated environments or alternative
generative models, GaitCrafter trains a video diffusion model from scratch,
exclusively on gait silhouette data. Our approach enables the generation of
temporally consistent and identity-preserving gait sequences. Moreover, the
generation process is controllable-allowing conditioning on various covariates
such as clothing, carried objects, and view angle. We show that incorporating
synthetic samples generated by GaitCrafter into the gait recognition pipeline
leads to improved performance, especially under challenging conditions.
Additionally, we introduce a mechanism to generate novel identities-synthetic
individuals not present in the original dataset-by interpolating identity
embeddings. These novel identities exhibit unique, consistent gait patterns and
are useful for training models while maintaining privacy of real subjects.
Overall, our work takes an important step toward leveraging diffusion models
for high-quality, controllable, and privacy-aware gait data generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Prune2Drive是一个即插即用的视觉token剪枝框架，用于自动驾驶中的多视角视觉语言模型，通过多样性感知token选择和视图自适应剪枝控制，在保持性能的同时显著提升推理速度和减少内存消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶系统中的视觉语言模型在处理高分辨率多视角图像时会产生大量视觉token，导致计算开销巨大、推理延迟高和内存消耗大，这阻碍了模型的实际部署。

Method: 提出两种核心创新：1）基于最远点采样的多样性感知token选择机制，优先考虑跨视图的语义和空间覆盖；2）视图自适应剪枝控制器，根据每个摄像头视图对下游驾驶任务的重要性学习最优剪枝比例。

Result: 在两个大规模多视角驾驶基准测试中，当仅保留10%的视觉token时，实现了6.40倍的预填充阶段加速，仅消耗原始FLOPs的13.4%，在DriveLM基准上性能仅下降3%。

Conclusion: Prune2Drive无需模型重新训练或访问注意力图，与现代高效注意力实现兼容，能够显著提升多视角视觉语言模型在自动驾驶中的部署效率。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as a promising paradigm in
autonomous driving (AD), offering a unified framework for perception,
reasoning, and decision-making by jointly modeling visual inputs and natural
language instructions. However, their deployment is hindered by the significant
computational overhead incurred when processing high-resolution, multi-view
images, a standard setup in AD systems with six or more synchronized cameras.
This overhead stems from the large number of visual tokens generated during
encoding, increasing inference latency and memory consumption due to the
quadratic complexity of self-attention. To address these challenges, we propose
Prune2Drive, a plug-and-play visual token pruning framework for multi-view VLMs
in autonomous driving. Prune2Drive introduces two core innovations: (i) a
diversity-aware token selection mechanism inspired by farthest point sampling,
which prioritizes semantic and spatial coverage across views rather than
relying solely on attention scores, and (ii) a view-adaptive pruning controller
that learns optimal pruning ratios for each camera view based on their
importance to downstream driving tasks. Unlike prior methods, Prune2Drive does
not require model retraining or access to attention maps, making it compatible
with modern efficient attention implementations. Extensive experiments on two
large-scale multi-view driving benchmarks, DriveLM and DriveLMM-o1, show that
Prune2Drive achieves significant speedups and memory savings while maintaining
or improving task performance. When retaining only 10% of the visual tokens,
our method achieves a 6.40$\times$ speedup in the prefilling phase and consumes
13.4% of the original FLOPs, with only a 3% performance drop on the DriveLM
benchmark.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DAASH是一个完全可微分的元攻击框架，通过策略性地组合现有的Lp范数攻击方法，生成有效且感知对齐的对抗样本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Lp范数约束对抗样本往往与人类感知不一致，且不清楚Lp约束攻击的见解是否能有效提升感知效果。

Method: 多阶段框架，每阶段聚合多个基础攻击的候选对抗样本，使用学习到的自适应权重，并通过新颖的元损失函数联合最小化误分类损失和感知失真。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和ImageNet上显著优于最先进的感知攻击方法AdvAD，攻击成功率提高20.63%，视觉质量指标(SSIM、LPIPS、FID)均有显著改善。

Conclusion: DAASH能够很好地泛化到未见过的防御方法，是评估鲁棒性的实用且强大的基准，无需为每个新防御手工设计自适应攻击。

Abstract: Numerous techniques have been proposed for generating adversarial examples in
white-box settings under strict Lp-norm constraints. However, such norm-bounded
examples often fail to align well with human perception, and only recently have
a few methods begun specifically exploring perceptually aligned adversarial
examples. Moreover, it remains unclear whether insights from Lp-constrained
attacks can be effectively leveraged to improve perceptual efficacy. In this
paper, we introduce DAASH, a fully differentiable meta-attack framework that
generates effective and perceptually aligned adversarial examples by
strategically composing existing Lp-based attack methods. DAASH operates in a
multi-stage fashion: at each stage, it aggregates candidate adversarial
examples from multiple base attacks using learned, adaptive weights and
propagates the result to the next stage. A novel meta-loss function guides this
process by jointly minimizing misclassification loss and perceptual distortion,
enabling the framework to dynamically modulate the contribution of each base
attack throughout the stages. We evaluate DAASH on adversarially trained models
across CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet. Despite relying solely on
Lp-constrained based methods, DAASH significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
perceptual attacks such as AdvAD -- achieving higher attack success rates
(e.g., 20.63\% improvement) and superior visual quality, as measured by SSIM,
LPIPS, and FID (improvements $\approx$ of 11, 0.015, and 5.7, respectively).
Furthermore, DAASH generalizes well to unseen defenses, making it a practical
and strong baseline for evaluating robustness without requiring handcrafted
adaptive attacks for each new defense.

Abstract: We introduce a scalable, interpretable computer-vision framework for
quantifying aesthetic outcomes of facial plastic surgery using frontal
photographs. Our pipeline leverages automated landmark detection, geometric
facial symmetry computation, deep-learning-based age estimation, and nasal
morphology analysis. To perform this study, we first assemble the largest
curated dataset of paired pre- and post-operative facial images to date,
encompassing 7,160 photographs from 1,259 patients. This dataset includes a
dedicated rhinoplasty-only subset consisting of 732 images from 366 patients,
96.2% of whom showed improvement in at least one of the three nasal
measurements with statistically significant group-level change. Among these
patients, the greatest statistically significant improvements (p < 0.001)
occurred in the alar width to face width ratio (77.0%), nose length to face
height ratio (41.5%), and alar width to intercanthal ratio (39.3%). Among the
broader frontal-view cohort, comprising 989 rigorously filtered subjects, 71.3%
exhibited significant enhancements in global facial symmetry or perceived age
(p < 0.01). Importantly, our analysis shows that patient identity remains
consistent post-operatively, with True Match Rates of 99.5% and 99.6% at a
False Match Rate of 0.01% for the rhinoplasty-specific and general patient
cohorts, respectively. Additionally, we analyze inter-practitioner variability
in improvement rates. By providing reproducible, quantitative benchmarks and a
novel dataset, our pipeline facilitates data-driven surgical planning, patient
counseling, and objective outcome evaluation across practices.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in natural
language processing and multi-modal understanding. However, their high
computational cost, limited accessibility, and data privacy concerns hinder
their adoption in resource-constrained healthcare environments. This study
investigates the performance of small language models (SLMs) in a medical
imaging classification task, comparing different models and prompt designs to
identify the optimal combination for accuracy and usability. Using the NIH
Chest X-ray dataset, we evaluate multiple SLMs on the task of classifying chest
X-ray positions (anteroposterior [AP] vs. posteroanterior [PA]) under three
prompt strategies: baseline instruction, incremental summary prompts, and
correction-based reflective prompts. Our results show that certain SLMs achieve
competitive accuracy with well-crafted prompts, suggesting that prompt
engineering can substantially enhance SLM performance in healthcare
applications without requiring deep AI expertise from end users.

### [12] [Mitigating Easy Option Bias in Multiple-Choice Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13428)
*Hao Zhang,Chen Li,Basura Fernando*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文发现多选视觉问答数据集中存在"易选项偏见"(EOB)问题，视觉-语言模型只需视觉和选项就能猜出正确答案，无需问题信息。研究者提出了GroundAttack工具来生成难选项，创建了无EOB偏见的新数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多选视觉问答数据集中存在系统性偏见，正确答案与视觉内容在特征空间中更为符合，使得模型可以不依赖问题就能猜出答案，影响了对模型真实能力的评估。

Method: 通过基础实验识别EOB问题，归因于视觉相关性不平衡。提出GroundAttack工具自动生成与正确答案视觉可能性相似的难选项，并应用于NExT-QA和MMStar数据集创建新的无EOB偏见注释。

Result: 在新的EOB-free注释上，当前的视觉-语言模型在(V+O)设置下几乎达到随机准确率，在(V+Q+O)设置下也下降到非饱和准确率，提供了更现实的模型能力评估。

Conclusion: 论文揭示了多选视觉问答数据集中存在的系统性偏见问题，并提供了有效的解决方案。通过消除EOB偏见，能够更准确地评估视觉-语言模型的真实问答能力。

Abstract: In this early study, we observe an Easy-Options Bias (EOB) issue in some
multiple-choice Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks such as MMStar,
RealWorldQA, SEED-Bench, Next-QA, STAR benchmark and Video-MME. This bias
allows vision-language models (VLMs) to select the correct answer using only
the vision (V) and options (O) as inputs, without the need for the question
(Q). Through grounding experiments, we attribute the bias to an imbalance in
visual relevance: the correct answer typically aligns more closely with the
visual contents than the negative options in feature space, creating a shortcut
for VLMs to infer the answer via simply vision-option similarity matching. To
fix this, we introduce GroundAttack, a toolkit that automatically generates
hard negative options as visually plausible as the correct answer. We apply it
to the NExT-QA and MMStar datasets, creating new EOB-free annotations. On these
EOB-free annotations, current VLMs approach to random accuracies under (V+O)
settings, and drop to non-saturated accuracies under (V+Q+O) settings,
providing a more realistic evaluation of VLMs' QA ability. Codes and new
annotations will be released soon.

are vital for advancing Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and autonomous
driving. Traditional approaches often struggle with scalability and
generalization, particularly under the complex and dynamic conditions of
real-world environments. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel
structured prompting and knowledge distillation framework that enables
automatic generation of high-quality traffic scene annotations and contextual
risk assessments. Our framework orchestrates two large Vision-Language Models
(VLMs): GPT-4o and o3-mini, using a structured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) strategy
to produce rich, multi-perspective outputs. These outputs serve as
knowledge-enriched pseudo-annotations for supervised fine-tuning of a much
smaller student VLM. The resulting compact 3B-scale model, named VISTA (Vision
for Intelligent Scene and Traffic Analysis), is capable of understanding
low-resolution traffic videos and generating semantically faithful, risk-aware
captions. Despite its significantly reduced parameter count, VISTA achieves
strong performance across established captioning metrics (BLEU-4, METEOR,
ROUGE-L, and CIDEr) when benchmarked against its teacher models. This
demonstrates that effective knowledge distillation and structured multi-agent
supervision can empower lightweight VLMs to capture complex reasoning
capabilities. The compact architecture of VISTA facilitates efficient
deployment on edge devices, enabling real-time risk monitoring without
requiring extensive infrastructure upgrades.

TL;DR: EDTalk++是一个新颖的完全解耦框架，用于可控说话头生成，能够独立控制嘴型、头部姿态、眼部运动和情感表达，支持视频和音频输入。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法往往忽视面部特征的解耦空间，无法实现独立操作且不能与不同模态输入共享。需要确保面部特征a)独立操作无相互干扰，b)能够保存并与不同模态输入共享。

Method: 使用四个轻量级模块将面部动态分解为嘴型、姿态、眼部和表情四个独立的潜在空间，每个空间由一组可学习基向量定义。通过正交性约束确保独立性，并设计高效训练策略分配运动责任。学习到的基向量存储在相应库中，实现与音频输入的共享视觉先验。

Result: 实验证明了EDTalk++的有效性，能够实现面部各个部分的独立控制，并支持多种输入模态。

Conclusion: EDTalk++提供了一个完整的解耦框架，成功解决了面部特征独立控制和多模态输入共享的问题，在可控说话头生成方面表现出色。

Abstract: Achieving disentangled control over multiple facial motions and accommodating
diverse input modalities greatly enhances the application and entertainment of
the talking head generation. This necessitates a deep exploration of the
decoupling space for facial features, ensuring that they a) operate
independently without mutual interference and b) can be preserved to share with
different modal inputs, both aspects often neglected in existing methods. To
address this gap, this paper proposes EDTalk++, a novel full disentanglement
framework for controllable talking head generation. Our framework enables
individual manipulation of mouth shape, head pose, eye movement, and emotional
expression, conditioned on video or audio inputs. Specifically, we employ four
lightweight modules to decompose the facial dynamics into four distinct latent
spaces representing mouth, pose, eye, and expression, respectively. Each space
is characterized by a set of learnable bases whose linear combinations define
specific motions. To ensure independence and accelerate training, we enforce
orthogonality among bases and devise an efficient training strategy to allocate
motion responsibilities to each space without relying on external knowledge.
The learned bases are then stored in corresponding banks, enabling shared
visual priors with audio input. Furthermore, considering the properties of each
space, we propose an Audio-to-Motion module for audio-driven talking head
synthesis. Experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of
EDTalk++.

Abstract: Kidney stone classification from endoscopic images is critical for
personalized treatment and recurrence prevention. While convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) have shown promise in this task, their limited ability to
capture long-range dependencies can hinder performance under variable imaging
conditions. This study presents a comparative analysis between Vision
Transformers (ViTs) and CNN-based models, evaluating their performance on two
ex vivo datasets comprising CCD camera and flexible ureteroscope images. The
ViT-base model pretrained on ImageNet-21k consistently outperformed a ResNet50
baseline across multiple imaging conditions. For instance, in the most visually
complex subset (Section patches from endoscopic images), the ViT model achieved
95.2% accuracy and 95.1% F1-score, compared to 64.5% and 59.3% with ResNet50.
In the mixed-view subset from CCD-camera images, ViT reached 87.1% accuracy
versus 78.4% with CNN. These improvements extend across precision and recall as
well. The results demonstrate that ViT-based architectures provide superior
classification performance and offer a scalable alternative to conventional
CNNs for kidney stone image analysis.

TL;DR: MINR通过共享中间层和添加投影层来高效编码多图像，在保持性能的同时减少60%参数


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有隐式神经表示(INR)为每张图像使用单独网络导致计算和存储效率低下，特别是在处理多图像时

Method: 分析训练好的INR层间权重分布，发现中间层分布模式高度相似，因此共享中间层而保持输入输出层独立，并为每张图像添加新的投影层捕获独特特征

Result: 在图像重建和超分辨率任务中，MINR节省60%参数的同时保持可比性能，可有效处理100张图像并维持34dB平均PSNR

Conclusion: MINR通过层共享策略实现了多图像编码的高效性，证明了其鲁棒性和可扩展性

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) aim to parameterize discrete signals
through implicit continuous functions. However, formulating each image with a
separate neural network~(typically, a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)) leads to
computational and storage inefficiencies when encoding multi-images. To address
this issue, we propose MINR, sharing specific layers to encode multi-image
efficiently. We first compare the layer-wise weight distributions for several
trained INRs and find that corresponding intermediate layers follow highly
similar distribution patterns. Motivated by this, we share these intermediate
layers across multiple images while preserving the input and output layers as
input-specific. In addition, we design an extra novel projection layer for each
image to capture its unique features. Experimental results on image
reconstruction and super-resolution tasks demonstrate that MINR can save up to
60\% parameters while maintaining comparable performance. Particularly, MINR
scales effectively to handle 100 images, maintaining an average peak
signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of 34 dB. Further analysis of various backbones
proves the robustness of the proposed MINR.

TL;DR: DHQ是一种针对隐式神经表示(INRs)的分布感知哈达玛量化方案，通过哈达玛变换将权重和激活值的不同分布标准化为统一钟形分布，然后应用标准量化器，显著提升硬件效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的INR量化方法主要关注权重量化，缺乏激活值量化，硬件节省有限。INRs中不同层的权重和激活值分布差异显著，需要统一的量化方案来充分利用量化带来的硬件优势。

Method: 提出DHQ方案：1）分析发现INRs中首尾层权重和激活值分布与其他层不同；2）使用哈达玛变换将这些不同分布标准化为统一钟形分布；3）应用标准量化器进行量化；4）在FPGA上实现硬件高效方案。

Result: 在多种图像重建任务上，DHQ相比全精度版本：延迟降低32.7%，能耗降低40.1%，资源利用率最高提升98.3%，性能优于之前的量化方法。

Conclusion: DHQ通过分布感知的哈达玛量化有效解决了INRs中权重和激活值分布差异问题，实现了显著的硬件效率提升，为INRs的硬件部署提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) encode discrete signals using
Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) with complex activation functions. While INRs
achieve superior performance, they depend on full-precision number
representation for accurate computation, resulting in significant hardware
overhead. Previous INR quantization approaches have primarily focused on weight
quantization, offering only limited hardware savings due to the lack of
activation quantization. To fully exploit the hardware benefits of
quantization, we propose DHQ, a novel distribution-aware Hadamard quantization
scheme that targets both weights and activations in INRs. Our analysis shows
that the weights in the first and last layers have distributions distinct from
those in the intermediate layers, while the activations in the last layer
differ significantly from those in the preceding layers. Instead of customizing
quantizers individually, we utilize the Hadamard transformation to standardize
these diverse distributions into a unified bell-shaped form, supported by both
empirical evidence and theoretical analysis, before applying a standard
quantizer. To demonstrate the practical advantages of our approach, we present
an FPGA implementation of DHQ that highlights its hardware efficiency.
Experiments on diverse image reconstruction tasks show that DHQ outperforms
previous quantization methods, reducing latency by 32.7\%, energy consumption
by 40.1\%, and resource utilization by up to 98.3\% compared to full-precision
counterparts.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) encode discrete signals in a
continuous manner using neural networks, demonstrating significant value across
various multimedia applications. However, the vulnerability of INRs presents a
critical challenge for their real-world deployments, as the network weights
might be subjected to unavoidable perturbations. In this work, we investigate
the robustness of INRs for the first time and find that even minor
perturbations can lead to substantial performance degradation in the quality of
signal reconstruction. To mitigate this issue, we formulate the robustness
problem in INRs by minimizing the difference between loss with and without
weight perturbations. Furthermore, we derive a novel robust loss function to
regulate the gradient of the reconstruction loss with respect to weights,
thereby enhancing the robustness. Extensive experiments on reconstruction tasks
across multiple modalities demonstrate that our method achieves up to a 7.5~dB
improvement in peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) values compared to original
INRs under noisy conditions.

Conclusion: FAMNet通过2D/3D CNN融合和多任务学习策略，能够有效提取微表情的全方位特征，显著提升了微表情识别的性能

Abstract: Micro-expressions recognition (MER) has essential application value in many
fields, but the short duration and low intensity of micro-expressions (MEs)
bring considerable challenges to MER. The current MER methods in deep learning
mainly include three data loading methods: static images, dynamic image
sequence, and a combination of the two streams. How to effectively extract MEs'
fine-grained and spatiotemporal features has been difficult to solve. This
paper proposes a new MER method based on multi-task learning and hierarchical
attention, which fully extracts MEs' omni-directional features by merging 2D
and 3D CNNs. The fusion model consists of a 2D CNN AMNet2D and a 3D CNN
AMNet3D, with similar structures consisting of a shared backbone network
Resnet18 and attention modules. During training, the model adopts different
data loading methods to adapt to two specific networks respectively, jointly
trains on the tasks of MER and facial action unit detection (FAUD), and adopts
the parameter hard sharing for information association, which further improves
the effect of the MER task, and the final fused model is called FAMNet.
Extensive experimental results show that our proposed FAMNet significantly
improves task performance. On the SAMM, CASME II and MMEW datasets, FAMNet
achieves 83.75% (UAR) and 84.03% (UF1). Furthermore, on the challenging
CAS(ME)$^3$ dataset, FAMNet achieves 51% (UAR) and 43.42% (UF1).

Abstract: 4D radar-based object detection has garnered great attention for its
robustness in adverse weather conditions and capacity to deliver rich spatial

noise patterns and extract discriminative features from raw 4D radar data.
Designed as a plug-and-play architecture, our solution enables seamless
integration into voxel-based detection frameworks without modifying existing
pipelines. Notably, the proposed method only utilizes LiDAR data for
cross-modal supervision during training while maintaining full radar-only
operation during inference. Extensive evaluation on the challenging Dual-Radar
dataset, which is characterized by elevated noise level, demonstrates the
effectiveness of our framework in enhancing detection robustness. Comprehensive
experiments validate that CORENet achieves superior performance compared to
existing mainstream approaches.

Conclusion: BDCL框架通过创新的双层解耦和一致性学习机制，有效提升了多视图聚类的性能，增强了特征的簇间区分能力和簇内紧凑性

Abstract: Multi-view clustering has shown to be an effective method for analyzing
underlying patterns in multi-view data. The performance of clustering can be
improved by learning the consistency and complementarity between multi-view
features, however, cluster-oriented representation learning is often
overlooked. In this paper, we propose a novel Bi-level Decoupling and
Consistency Learning framework (BDCL) to further explore the effective
representation for multi-view data to enhance inter-cluster discriminability
and intra-cluster compactness of features in multi-view clustering. Our
framework comprises three modules: 1) The multi-view instance learning module
aligns the consistent information while preserving the private features between
views through reconstruction autoencoder and contrastive learning. 2) The
bi-level decoupling of features and clusters enhances the discriminability of
feature space and cluster space. 3) The consistency learning module treats the
different views of the sample and their neighbors as positive pairs, learns the
consistency of their clustering assignments, and further compresses the
intra-cluster space. Experimental results on five benchmark datasets
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method compared with the SOTA
methods. Our code is published on https://github.com/LouisDong95/BDCL.

Motivation: 现有HDR技术忽视了快门速度与ISO的复杂交互作用，以及动态场景中运动模糊的影响，导致高ISO产生噪声而长快门引起模糊

Method: 采用强化学习算法，集成包含运动模糊和噪声模拟的图像合成流程，利用语义信息和曝光直方图来适应性选择最优的ISO和快门速度序列

Result: 在多个数据集上达到了状态前沿性能，能够根据用户定义的曝光时间预算找到比传统方案更好的曝光调度策略

Conclusion: AdaptiveAE通过考虑动态场景特性和曝光参数之间的复杂交互，有效提升了HDR图像的重建质量，为动态环境中的高质量拍摄提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Mainstream high dynamic range imaging techniques typically rely on fusing
multiple images captured with different exposure setups (shutter speed and
ISO). A good balance between shutter speed and ISO is crucial for achieving
high-quality HDR, as high ISO values introduce significant noise, while long
shutter speeds can lead to noticeable motion blur. However, existing methods
often overlook the complex interaction between shutter speed and ISO and fail
to account for motion blur effects in dynamic scenes.
  In this work, we propose AdaptiveAE, a reinforcement learning-based method
that optimizes the selection of shutter speed and ISO combinations to maximize
HDR reconstruction quality in dynamic environments. AdaptiveAE integrates an
image synthesis pipeline that incorporates motion blur and noise simulation
into our training procedure, leveraging semantic information and exposure
histograms. It can adaptively select optimal ISO and shutter speed sequences
based on a user-defined exposure time budget, and find a better exposure
schedule than traditional solutions. Experimental results across multiple
datasets demonstrate that it achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Badminton is known as one of the fastest racket sports in the world. Despite
doubles matches being more prevalent in international tournaments than singles,
previous research has mainly focused on singles due to the challenges in data
availability and multi-person tracking. To address this gap, we designed an
approach that transfers singles-trained models to doubles analysis. We
extracted keypoints from the ShuttleSet single matches dataset using ViT-Pose
and embedded them through a contrastive learning framework based on ST-GCN. To
improve tracking stability, we incorporated a custom multi-object tracking
algorithm that resolves ID switching issues from fast and overlapping player
movements. A Transformer-based classifier then determines shot occurrences
based on the learned embeddings. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of
extending pose-based shot recognition to doubles badminton, broadening
analytics capabilities. This work establishes a foundation for doubles-specific
datasets to enhance understanding of this predominant yet understudied format
of the fast racket sport.

Conclusion: VGQ通过集成2D高斯分布的方式有效收集了结构信息，在保持标记效率的同时提升了视觉丰富性，为图像生成提供了更好的编码基础。

Abstract: The image tokenizer is a critical component in AR image generation, as it
determines how rich and structured visual content is encoded into compact
representations. Existing quantization-based tokenizers such as VQ-GAN
primarily focus on appearance features like texture and color, often neglecting
geometric structures due to their patch-based design. In this work, we explored
how to incorporate more visual information into the tokenizer and proposed a
new framework named Visual Gaussian Quantization (VGQ), a novel tokenizer
paradigm that explicitly enhances structural modeling by integrating 2D
Gaussians into traditional visual codebook quantization frameworks. Our
approach addresses the inherent limitations of naive quantization methods such
as VQ-GAN, which struggle to model structured visual information due to their
patch-based design and emphasis on texture and color. In contrast, VGQ encodes
image latents as 2D Gaussian distributions, effectively capturing geometric and
spatial structures by directly modeling structure-related parameters such as
position, rotation and scale. We further demonstrate that increasing the
density of 2D Gaussians within the tokens leads to significant gains in
reconstruction fidelity, providing a flexible trade-off between token
efficiency and visual richness. On the ImageNet 256x256 benchmark, VGQ achieves
strong reconstruction quality with an rFID score of 1.00. Furthermore, by
increasing the density of 2D Gaussians within the tokens, VGQ gains a
significant boost in reconstruction capability and achieves a state-of-the-art
reconstruction rFID score of 0.556 and a PSNR of 24.93, substantially
outperforming existing methods. Codes will be released soon.

Method: 利用现成的视觉基础模型（如CLIP、DINOv2）进行特征提取，发现特征分布的几何形状具有跨领域和数据集的转移性。构建了几何知识导向的分布检验框架，应用于联邦学习和长尾分布识别两个场景。

Result: 综合实验显示，该方法能够有效克服数据异质性和样本不平衡导致的信息缺失，在多个标准测试集上都取得了性能提升。

Conclusion: 论文提出的几何知识导向分布检验框架为解决深度学习中的分布差距问题提供了有效方法，在联邦学习和长尾分布识别中都取得了显著效果。

Abstract: Despite the fast progress of deep learning, one standing challenge is the gap
of the observed training samples and the underlying true distribution. There
are multiple reasons for the causing of this gap e.g. sampling bias, noise etc.
In the era of foundation models, we show that when leveraging the off-the-shelf
(vision) foundation models (e.g., CLIP, DINOv2) for feature extraction, the
geometric shapes of the resulting feature distributions exhibit remarkable
transferability across domains and datasets. To verify its practical
usefulness, we embody our geometric knowledge-guided distribution calibration
framework in two popular and challenging settings: federated learning and
long-tailed recognition. In the federated setting, we devise a technique of
acquiring the global geometric shape under privacy constraints, then leverage
this knowledge to generate new samples for clients, in the aim of bridging the
gap between local and global observations. In long-tailed learning, it utilizes
the geometric knowledge transferred from sample-rich categories to recover the
true distribution for sample-scarce tail classes. Comprehensive experiments
show that our proposed geometric knowledge-guided distribution calibration
effectively overcomes information deficits caused by data heterogeneity and
sample imbalance, with boosted performance across benchmarks.

Motivation: 现有6D位姿估计数据集主要关注小型家用物体，无法满足移动机器人在工业环境中的需求，如远距离感知、严重自遮挡和多样化相机视角等挑战。

Method: 创建包含92个真实场景、16个独特物体的MR6D数据集，涵盖静态和动态交互场景，捕捉移动平台特有的挑战性条件。

Result: 初步实验显示现有6D位姿估计方法在这些场景下表现不佳，2D分割成为另一个技术瓶颈。

Conclusion: MR6D为开发和评估面向移动机器人需求的位姿估计方法奠定了基础，数据集已公开提供。

Abstract: Existing 6D pose estimation datasets primarily focus on small household
objects typically handled by robot arm manipulators, limiting their relevance
to mobile robotics. Mobile platforms often operate without manipulators,
interact with larger objects, and face challenges such as long-range
perception, heavy self-occlusion, and diverse camera perspectives. While recent
models generalize well to unseen objects, evaluations remain confined to
household-like settings that overlook these factors. We introduce MR6D, a
dataset designed for 6D pose estimation for mobile robots in industrial
environments. It includes 92 real-world scenes featuring 16 unique objects
across static and dynamic interactions. MR6D captures the challenges specific
to mobile platforms, including distant viewpoints, varied object
configurations, larger object sizes, and complex occlusion/self-occlusion
patterns. Initial experiments reveal that current 6D pipelines underperform in
these settings, with 2D segmentation being another hurdle. MR6D establishes a
foundation for developing and evaluating pose estimation methods tailored to
the demands of mobile robotics. The dataset is available at

Abstract: Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) is crucial for applications such as
human-computer interaction and mental health diagnostics. This study presents
the first empirical comparison of open-source Vision-Language Models (VLMs),
including Phi-3.5 Vision and CLIP, against traditional deep learning models
VGG19, ResNet-50, and EfficientNet-B0 on the challenging FER-2013 dataset,
which contains 35,887 low-resolution grayscale images across seven emotion
classes. To address the mismatch between VLM training assumptions and the noisy
nature of FER data, we introduce a novel pipeline that integrates GFPGAN-based
image restoration with FER evaluation. Results show that traditional models,
particularly EfficientNet-B0 (86.44%) and ResNet-50 (85.72%), significantly
outperform VLMs like CLIP (64.07%) and Phi-3.5 Vision (51.66%), highlighting
the limitations of VLMs in low-quality visual tasks. In addition to performance
evaluation using precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy, we provide a
detailed computational cost analysis covering preprocessing, training,
inference, and evaluation phases, offering practical insights for deployment.
This work underscores the need for adapting VLMs to noisy environments and
provides a reproducible benchmark for future research in emotion recognition.

Motivation: 现有的3DGS基于方法在捕捉细细微面部表情和保持局部纹理连续性方面面临挑战，特别是在高可变形区域

Method: 提出稀疏表情控制机制，用少量关键高斯影响邻近高斯的变形，并利用预训练生成模型的高质量3D先验知识提供更可靠面部几何结构

Result: 实验结果表明该方法能够产生更准确和视觉一致的头部重建结果，具有改进的表情可控性和细节保真度

Conclusion: EAvatar框架通过表情感知和变形感知的设计，有效解决了高保真头部虚拟人重建中的细微表情捕捉和纹理连续性问题

Abstract: High-fidelity head avatar reconstruction plays a crucial role in AR/VR,
gaming, and multimedia content creation. Recent advances in 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) have demonstrated effectiveness in modeling complex geometry
with real-time rendering capability and are now widely used in high-fidelity
head avatar reconstruction tasks. However, existing 3DGS-based methods still
face significant challenges in capturing fine-grained facial expressions and
preserving local texture continuity, especially in highly deformable regions.
To mitigate these limitations, we propose a novel 3DGS-based framework termed
EAvatar for head reconstruction that is both expression-aware and
deformation-aware. Our method introduces a sparse expression control mechanism,
where a small number of key Gaussians are used to influence the deformation of
their neighboring Gaussians, enabling accurate modeling of local deformations
and fine-scale texture transitions. Furthermore, we leverage high-quality 3D
priors from pretrained generative models to provide a more reliable facial
geometry, offering structural guidance that improves convergence stability and
shape accuracy during training. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method produces more accurate and visually coherent head reconstructions with
improved expression controllability and detail fidelity.

TL;DR: FLAIR提出频率和局部性感知的隐式神经表示，通过RC-GAUSS激活函数和WEGE编码解决现有INRs缺乏频率选择性和空间局部性的问题，在2D图像和3D重建任务中表现优异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有隐式神经表示(INRs)缺乏频率选择性、空间局部性和稀疏表示，过度依赖冗余信号分量，存在频谱偏差问题，难以捕捉高频细节

Method: 提出FLAIR方法：1) RC-GAUSS激活函数，在时频不确定性原理约束下实现显式频率选择和空间定位；2) 小波能量引导编码(WEGE)，利用离散小波变换计算能量分数并显式引导频率信息

Result: 在2D图像表示和恢复以及3D重建任务中，该方法持续优于现有INRs

Conclusion: FLAIR通过频率感知和局部性感知的机制有效解决了INRs的频谱偏差问题，提升了高频细节的捕捉能力

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) leverage neural networks to map
coordinates to corresponding signals, enabling continuous and compact
representations. This paradigm has driven significant advances in various
vision tasks. However, existing INRs lack frequency selectivity, spatial
localization, and sparse representations, leading to an over-reliance on
redundant signal components. Consequently, they exhibit spectral bias, tending
to learn low-frequency components early while struggling to capture fine
high-frequency details. To address these issues, we propose FLAIR (Frequency-
and Locality-Aware Implicit Neural Representations), which incorporates two key
innovations. The first is RC-GAUSS, a novel activation designed for explicit
frequency selection and spatial localization under the constraints of the
time-frequency uncertainty principle (TFUP). The second is
Wavelet-Energy-Guided Encoding (WEGE), which leverages the discrete wavelet
transform (DWT) to compute energy scores and explicitly guide frequency
information to the network. Our method consistently outperforms existing INRs
in 2D image representation and restoration, as well as 3D reconstruction.

Motivation: 当前基于硬件的眼动追踪系统成本高、校准复杂且硬件兼容性受限，限制了注视点渲染技术的广泛应用。需要开发纯软件解决方案来降低部署门槛。

Method: 使用球形视觉变换器处理360度VR场景，结合LSTM时序编码器捕捉注视序列模式，通过多模态融合网络整合空间场景特征和时序注视动态来预测未来注视位置。

Result: 在综合VR数据集上实现3.83度中位角度误差，比传统显著性基线方法提升24%，提供可靠的置信度校准，在不同空间区域和场景类型中保持稳定性能。

Conclusion: 纯软件注视预测能够有效支持VR注视点渲染，使性能提升更易于在不同VR平台和应用中部署，无需额外硬件要求。

Abstract: Foveated rendering significantly reduces computational demands in virtual
reality applications by concentrating rendering quality where users focus their
gaze. Current approaches require expensive hardware-based eye tracking systems,
limiting widespread adoption due to cost, calibration complexity, and hardware
compatibility constraints. This paper presents GazeProphet, a software-only
approach for predicting gaze locations in VR environments without requiring
dedicated eye tracking hardware. The approach combines a Spherical Vision
Transformer for processing 360-degree VR scenes with an LSTM-based temporal
encoder that captures gaze sequence patterns. A multi-modal fusion network
integrates spatial scene features with temporal gaze dynamics to predict future
gaze locations with associated confidence estimates. Experimental evaluation on
a comprehensive VR dataset demonstrates that GazeProphet achieves a median
angular error of 3.83 degrees, outperforming traditional saliency-based
baselines by 24% while providing reliable confidence calibration. The approach
maintains consistent performance across different spatial regions and scene
types, enabling practical deployment in VR systems without additional hardware
requirements. Statistical analysis confirms the significance of improvements
across all evaluation metrics. These results show that software-only gaze
prediction can work for VR foveated rendering, making this performance boost
more accessible to different VR platforms and apps.

Motivation: 解决生成式人脸视频编码（GFVC）实际部署中模型参数过大、计算成本过高的问题，以支持资源受限环境下的高效部署

Method: 双模式优化策略：1）结构重设-用更薄、更高效的层替换传统3x3卷积；2）两阶段适配性通道剪枝-训练期软剪枝通过可学习阈值识别冗余通道，训练后硬剪枝用导出的掩码永久删除这些通道

Conclusion: 该方法有望在移动边缘设备等资源受限环境中实现高效的GFVC部署，为轻量化生成式视频编码提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Generative Face Video Coding (GFVC) achieves superior rate-distortion
performance by leveraging the strong inference capabilities of deep generative
models. However, its practical deployment is hindered by large model parameters
and high computational costs. To address this, we propose a lightweight GFVC
framework that introduces dual-mode optimization -- combining architectural
redesign and operational refinement -- to reduce complexity whilst preserving
reconstruction quality. Architecturally, we replace traditional 3 x 3
convolutions with slimmer and more efficient layers, reducing complexity
without compromising feature expressiveness. Operationally, we develop a
two-stage adaptive channel pruning strategy: (1) soft pruning during training
identifies redundant channels via learnable thresholds, and (2) hard pruning
permanently eliminates these channels post-training using a derived mask. This
dual-phase approach ensures both training stability and inference efficiency.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed lightweight dual-mode
optimization for GFVC can achieve 90.4% parameter reduction and 88.9%
computation saving compared to the baseline, whilst achieving superior
performance compared to state-of-the-art video coding standard Versatile Video
Coding (VVC) in terms of perceptual-level quality metrics. As such, the
proposed method is expected to enable efficient GFVC deployment in
resource-constrained environments such as mobile edge devices.

Motivation: 解决SNN性能落后于CNN的问题，主要因为刺激数据信息容量有限，而现有用非刺激输入训练的方法又违背了神经科学计算的原则。

Method: 提出神经元样编码方法，基于生物神经元的内在运作原理和功能生成刺激数据，并添加人造光感器层以携带颜色和亮度信息。

Result: 实验结果显示，这种受生物学启发的方法有效增加了刺激信号的信息内容，提高了SNN的性能。

Conclusion: 这种方法遵循神经科学计算原则同时提升性能，具有强大的发展潜力，可能帮助克服神经科学计算的当前限制，促进SNN的更广泛应用。

Abstract: In recent years, neuromorphic computing and spiking neural networks (SNNs)
have ad-vanced rapidly through integration with deep learning. However, the
performance of SNNs still lags behind that of convolutional neural networks
(CNNs), primarily due to the limited information capacity of spike-based data.
Although some studies have attempted to improve SNN performance by training
them with non-spiking inputs such as static images, this approach deviates from
the original intent of neuromorphic computing, which emphasizes spike-based
information processing. To address this issue, we propose a Neuron-like
Encoding method that generates spike data based on the intrinsic operational
principles and functions of biological neurons. This method is further enhanced
by the incorporation of an artificial pho-toreceptor layer, enabling spike data
to carry both color and luminance information, thereby forming a complete
visual spike signal. Experimental results using the Integrate-and-Fire neuron
model demonstrate that this biologically inspired approach effectively
increases the information content of spike signals and improves SNN
performance, all while adhering to neuromorphic principles. We believe this
concept holds strong potential for future development and may contribute to
overcoming current limitations in neuro-morphic computing, facilitating broader
applications of SNNs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在少样本异常分割中的跨类别泛化能力严重依赖已知类别的真实异常样本先验知识，限制了在未见类别上的应用。

Method: 提出三组件框架：1）字典构建-使用正常参考图像特征模拟字典索引和内容；2）字典查找-通过稀疏查找策略检索查询区域特征，无法检索的特征被分类为异常；3）查询判别正则化-通过对比查询约束和文本对齐约束增强异常判别能力。

Result: 在7个工业和医学数据集上的广泛实验表明，DictAS持续优于最先进的少样本异常分割方法。

Conclusion: DictAS通过自监督字典查找机制成功实现了无需重新训练的跨类别异常检测，为少样本异常分割提供了新的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) have demonstrated remarkable
class-generalizable ability to unseen classes in few-shot anomaly segmentation
(FSAS), leveraging supervised prompt learning or fine-tuning on seen classes.
However, their cross-category generalization largely depends on prior knowledge
of real seen anomaly samples. In this paper, we propose a novel framework,
namely DictAS, which enables a unified model to detect visual anomalies in
unseen object categories without any retraining on the target data, only
employing a few normal reference images as visual prompts. The insight behind
DictAS is to transfer dictionary lookup capabilities to the FSAS task for
unseen classes via self-supervised learning, instead of merely memorizing the
normal and abnormal feature patterns from the training set. Specifically,
DictAS mainly consists of three components: (1) **Dictionary Construction** -
to simulate the index and content of a real dictionary using features from
normal reference images. (2) **Dictionary Lookup** - to retrieve queried region
features from the dictionary via a sparse lookup strategy. When a query feature
cannot be retrieved, it is classified as an anomaly. (3) **Query Discrimination
Regularization**- to enhance anomaly discrimination by making abnormal features
harder to retrieve from the dictionary. To achieve this, Contrastive Query
Constraint and Text Alignment Constraint are further proposed. Extensive
experiments on seven public industrial and medical datasets demonstrate that
DictAS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FSAS methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SMPLify作为3D人体姿态和形状估计的基准方法，虽然鲁棒但计算成本高。受其他领域用神经网络替代迭代优化实现显著运行时改进的启发，作者希望开发一个更高效的替代方案。

Method: 提出可学习的SMPLify框架，采用时序采样策略构建初始化-目标对进行训练，使用以人为中心的归一化方案和残差学习来缩小解空间，支持序列推理和插件式后处理。

Result: 方法实现了近200倍的速度提升，在未见过的3DPW和RICH数据集上泛化良好，作为插件工具在LucidAction上以模型无关的方式运行。

Conclusion: Learnable SMPLify建立了一个实用且简单的基准，在保持精度的同时大幅提升效率，具有良好的泛化能力和模型无关性。

Abstract: In 3D human pose and shape estimation, SMPLify remains a robust baseline that
solves inverse kinematics (IK) through iterative optimization. However, its
high computational cost limits its practicality. Recent advances across domains
have shown that replacing iterative optimization with data-driven neural
networks can achieve significant runtime improvements without sacrificing
accuracy. Motivated by this trend, we propose Learnable SMPLify, a neural
framework that replaces the iterative fitting process in SMPLify with a
single-pass regression model. The design of our framework targets two core
challenges in neural IK: data construction and generalization. To enable
effective training, we propose a temporal sampling strategy that constructs
initialization-target pairs from sequential frames. To improve generalization
across diverse motions and unseen poses, we propose a human-centric
normalization scheme and residual learning to narrow the solution space.
Learnable SMPLify supports both sequential inference and plug-in
post-processing to refine existing image-based estimators. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method establishes itself as a practical and
simple baseline: it achieves nearly 200x faster runtime compared to SMPLify,
generalizes well to unseen 3DPW and RICH, and operates in a model-agnostic
manner when used as a plug-in tool on LucidAction. The code is available at

Conclusion: 该方法通过有效利用特征语义，提供了一种适用于高性能IoT应用的稳健可扩展视频分析方案

Abstract: Video action analysis is a foundational technology within the realm of
intelligent video comprehension, particularly concerning its application in
Internet of Things(IoT). However, existing methodologies overlook feature
semantics in feature extraction and focus on optimizing action proposals, thus
these solutions are unsuitable for widespread adoption in high-performance IoT
applications due to the limitations in precision, such as autonomous driving,
which necessitate robust and scalable intelligent video analytics analysis. To
address this issue, we propose a novel generative attention-based model to
learn the relation of feature semantics. Specifically, by leveraging the
differences of actions' foreground and background, our model simultaneously
learns the frame- and segment-dependencies of temporal action feature
semantics, which takes advantage of feature semantics in the feature extraction
effectively. To evaluate the effectiveness of our model, we conduct extensive
experiments on two benchmark video task, action recognition and action
detection. In the context of action detection tasks, we substantiate the
superiority of our approach through comprehensive validation on widely
recognized datasets. Moreover, we extend the validation of the effectiveness of
our proposed method to a broader task, video action recognition. Our code is
available at https://github.com/Generative-Feature-Model/GAF.

TL;DR: 通过创新地整合现有分割方法和删除噪声预测模块，提出了一种新的时序条件参考视频对象分割模型，在四个公开测试集上达到最高水平的性能。


<details>

Motivation: 直观现当前参考视频对象分割方法往往过于重视特征提取和时序模型，而相对忽视了分割头部设计。分割头部设计仍有很大的改进空间。

Method: 1）创新性整合现有分割方法提升边界分割能力 2）利用文本到视频滴涼模型进行特征提取 3）删除传统噪声预测模块避免随机性影响精度 4）设计时序上下文掩码精细化模块（TCMR）充分利用VAE特征

Result: 在四个公开RVOS测试集上均达到了最高水平的性能，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该研究通过重新关注分割头部设计和简化模型结构，在保持高效性的同时显著提升了参考视频对象分割的准确性和边界分割质量。

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment specific objects
in a video according to textual descriptions. We observe that recent RVOS
approaches often place excessive emphasis on feature extraction and temporal
modeling, while relatively neglecting the design of the segmentation head. In
fact, there remains considerable room for improvement in segmentation head
design. To address this, we propose a Temporal-Conditional Referring Video
Object Segmentation model, which innovatively integrates existing segmentation
methods to effectively enhance boundary segmentation capability. Furthermore,
our model leverages a text-to-video diffusion model for feature extraction. On
top of this, we remove the traditional noise prediction module to avoid the
randomness of noise from degrading segmentation accuracy, thereby simplifying
the model while improving performance. Finally, to overcome the limited feature
extraction capability of the VAE, we design a Temporal Context Mask Refinement
(TCMR) module, which significantly improves segmentation quality without
introducing complex designs. We evaluate our method on four public RVOS
benchmarks, where it consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: 通过混合扩散-GAN方法将晴期图像转换为恶劣天气图像，提升自动驾驶系统在恶劣环境下的感知性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶系统在恶劣天气条件下性能显著下降，而相关数据集缺乏恶劣条件数据，收集和标注成本迅昂

Method: 提出域适应流水线，包括仿真、GAN和混合扩散-GAN方法，利用现有DA GAN并扩展支持辅助输入，开发新的训练方法结合仿真和真实图像

Result: 在ACDC数据集上评测，语义分割整体提升1.85%，夜间场景提升4.62%

Conclusion: 混合方法能够有效提升自动驾驶系统在挑战性条件下的感知稳健性

Abstract: Autonomous Driving (AD) systems exhibit markedly degraded performance under
adverse environmental conditions, such as low illumination and precipitation.
The underrepresentation of adverse conditions in AD datasets makes it
challenging to address this deficiency. To circumvent the prohibitive cost of
acquiring and annotating adverse weather data, we propose a novel Domain
Adaptation (DA) pipeline that transforms clear-weather images into fog, rain,
snow, and nighttime images. Here, we systematically develop and evaluate
several novel data-generation pipelines, including simulation-only, GAN-based,
and hybrid diffusion-GAN approaches, to synthesize photorealistic adverse
images from labelled clear images. We leverage an existing DA GAN, extend it to
support auxiliary inputs, and develop a novel training recipe that leverages
both simulated and real images. The simulated images facilitate exact
supervision by providing perfectly matched image pairs, while the real images
help bridge the simulation-to-real (sim2real) gap. We further introduce a
method to mitigate hallucinations and artifacts in Stable-Diffusion
Image-to-Image (img2img) outputs by blending them adaptively with their
progenitor images. We finetune downstream models on our synthetic data and
evaluate them on the Adverse Conditions Dataset with Correspondences (ACDC). We
achieve 1.85 percent overall improvement in semantic segmentation, and 4.62
percent on nighttime, demonstrating the efficacy of our hybrid method for
robust AD perception under challenging conditions.

Motivation: 状态空间模型在计算效率方面仍有改进空间，特别是在令牌简化方面需要考虑其独特的序列建模特性

Method: 提出MaMe方法，利用状态过渡参数δ作为信息量度量，通过策略性令牌排列保持序列信息流

Result: 在细调模型和开箱即用模型上都实现了优异的效率性能表现平衡，甚至在激进令牌简化条件下仍保持稳健性

Conclusion: MaMe方法不仅在图像分类中表现优异，还在视频和音频领域显示出强大的泛化能力，为SSM模型提供了高效的效率提升方案

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as powerful architectures in computer
vision, yet improving their computational efficiency remains crucial for
practical and scalable deployment.While token reduction serves as an effective
approach for model efficiency, applying it to SSMs requires careful
consideration of their unique sequential modeling capabilities.In this work, we
propose MaMe, a token-merging strategy tailored for SSM-based vision
models.MaMe addresses two key challenges: quantifying token importance and
preserving sequential properties. Our approach leverages the state transition
parameter $\mathbf{\Delta}$ as an informativeness measure and introduces
strategic token arrangements to preserve sequential information flow.Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MaMe achieves superior efficiency-performance
trade-offs for both fine-tuned and off-the-shelf models. Particularly, our
approach maintains robustness even under aggressive token reduction where
existing methods undergo significant performance degradation.Beyond image
classification, MaMe shows strong generalization capabilities across video and
audio domains, establishing an effective approach for enhancing efficiency in
diverse SSM applications.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖耦合编码器来提供语义和几何先验知识，导致模型在冲突需求之间做出折衷，限制了整体性能

Method: 提出双重解耦设计：源头级别使用基础编码器提供语义特征和立体成本体积，通道级别通过专门化通道精炼先验知识，使用混合视图变换生成补充性特征，并通过新的Axis-Aware Fusion模块进行合并

Result: 在SemanticKITTI上超越之前最佳方法+0.23 mIoU和+2.03 IoU，在SSCBench-KITTI-360上达到21.78 mIoU和48.61 IoU的独创性能

Conclusion: FoundationSSC通过双重解耦设计有效解决了语义和几何先验知识的冲突问题，在3D语义场景完成任务中实现了整体性能提升

Abstract: Camera-based 3D semantic scene completion (SSC) provides dense geometric and
semantic perception for autonomous driving and robotic navigation. However,
existing methods rely on a coupled encoder to deliver both semantic and
geometric priors, which forces the model to make a trade-off between
conflicting demands and limits its overall performance. To tackle these
challenges, we propose FoundationSSC, a novel framework that performs dual
decoupling at both the source and pathway levels. At the source level, we
introduce a foundation encoder that provides rich semantic feature priors for
the semantic branch and high-fidelity stereo cost volumes for the geometric
branch. At the pathway level, these priors are refined through specialised,
decoupled pathways, yielding superior semantic context and depth distributions.
Our dual-decoupling design produces disentangled and refined inputs, which are
then utilised by a hybrid view transformation to generate complementary 3D
features. Additionally, we introduce a novel Axis-Aware Fusion (AAF) module
that addresses the often-overlooked challenge of fusing these features by
anisotropically merging them into a unified representation. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the advantages of FoundationSSC, achieving simultaneous
improvements in both semantic and geometric metrics, surpassing prior bests by
+0.23 mIoU and +2.03 IoU on SemanticKITTI. Additionally, we achieve
state-of-the-art performance on SSCBench-KITTI-360, with 21.78 mIoU and 48.61
IoU. The code will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: With the growing demand for short videos and personalized content, automated
Video Log (Vlog) generation has become a key direction in multimodal content
creation. Existing methods mostly rely on predefined scripts, lacking dynamism
and personal expression. Therefore, there is an urgent need for an automated
Vlog generation approach that enables effective multimodal collaboration and
high personalization. To this end, we propose PersonaVlog, an automated
multimodal stylized Vlog generation framework that can produce personalized
Vlogs featuring videos, background music, and inner monologue speech based on a
given theme and reference image. Specifically, we propose a multi-agent
collaboration framework based on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). This
framework efficiently generates high-quality prompts for multimodal content
creation based on user input, thereby improving the efficiency and creativity
of the process. In addition, we incorporate a feedback and rollback mechanism
that leverages MLLMs to evaluate and provide feedback on generated results,
thereby enabling iterative self-correction of multimodal content. We also
propose ThemeVlogEval, a theme-based automated benchmarking framework that
provides standardized metrics and datasets for fair evaluation. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate the significant advantages and potential of our
framework over several baselines, highlighting its effectiveness and great
potential for generating automated Vlogs.

Abstract: Face mask detection has become increasingly important recently, particularly
during the COVID-19 pandemic. Many face detection models have been developed in
smart entryways using IoT. However, there is a lack of IoT development on face
mask detection. This paper proposes a two-factor authentication system for
smart entryway access control using facial recognition and passcode
verification and an automation process to alert the owner and activate the
surveillance system when a stranger is detected and controls the system
remotely via Telegram on a Raspberry Pi platform. The system employs the Local
Binary Patterns Histograms for the full face recognition algorithm and modified
LBPH algorithm for occluded face detection. On average, the system achieved an
Accuracy of approximately 70%, a Precision of approximately 80%, and a Recall
of approximately 83.26% across all tested users. The results indicate that the
system is capable of conducting face recognition and mask detection, automating
the operation of the remote control to register users, locking or unlocking the
door, and notifying the owner. The sample participants highly accept it for
future use in the user acceptance test.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音频驱动说话头合成模型在人类多样性（种族、语言、年龄）方面泛化能力不足，这主要是由于训练数据在规模、质量和多样性方面的局限性。

Method: 通过多阶段自动化流水线精心筛选运动稳定性、美学质量和面部细节，构建TalkVid数据集；同时创建TalkVid-Bench分层评估集，包含500个精心平衡的片段。

Result: 在TalkVid上训练的模型优于在先前数据集上训练的模型，展现出更好的跨数据集泛化能力；TalkVid-Bench分析揭示了传统聚合指标掩盖的性能差异。

Conclusion: TalkVid数据集和TalkVid-Bench评估基准为解决音频驱动说话头合成中的多样性泛化问题提供了重要资源，强调了平衡评估的必要性。

Abstract: Audio-driven talking head synthesis has achieved remarkable photorealism, yet
state-of-the-art (SOTA) models exhibit a critical failure: they lack
generalization to the full spectrum of human diversity in ethnicity, language,
and age groups. We argue that this generalization gap is a direct symptom of
limitations in existing training data, which lack the necessary scale, quality,
and diversity. To address this challenge, we introduce TalkVid, a new
large-scale, high-quality, and diverse dataset containing 1244 hours of video
from 7729 unique speakers. TalkVid is curated through a principled, multi-stage
automated pipeline that rigorously filters for motion stability, aesthetic
quality, and facial detail, and is validated against human judgments to ensure
its reliability. Furthermore, we construct and release TalkVid-Bench, a
stratified evaluation set of 500 clips meticulously balanced across key
demographic and linguistic axes. Our experiments demonstrate that a model
trained on TalkVid outperforms counterparts trained on previous datasets,
exhibiting superior cross-dataset generalization. Crucially, our analysis on
TalkVid-Bench reveals performance disparities across subgroups that are
obscured by traditional aggregate metrics, underscoring its necessity for
future research. Code and data can be found in

Motivation: 当前的RGB-D基于深度信息的类别级物体姿势估计方法在缺乏深度信息的场景中面临重大挑战，需要一种仅依赖RGB图像的方案来实现准确的姿势估计。

Method: 设计了基于transformer的神经网络来预测和融合目标物体的几何特征，并引入几何特征导向算法来确保特征准确描述物体几何信息，最后使用RANSAC-PnP算法解决变化尺度物体的姿势计算问题。

Result: 在标准数据集上的实验结果显示，该方法不仅高效而且在准确性上超过了之前的RGB基础方法。

Conclusion: 这些有前景的结果为使用RGB图像推进类别级物体姿势估计提供了新的视角。

Abstract: While most current RGB-D-based category-level object pose estimation methods
achieve strong performance, they face significant challenges in scenes lacking
depth information. In this paper, we propose a novel category-level object pose
estimation approach that relies solely on RGB images. This method enables
accurate pose estimation in real-world scenarios without the need for depth
data. Specifically, we design a transformer-based neural network for
category-level object pose estimation, where the transformer is employed to
predict and fuse the geometric features of the target object. To ensure that
these predicted geometric features faithfully capture the object's geometry, we
introduce a geometric feature-guided algorithm, which enhances the network's
ability to effectively represent the object's geometric information. Finally,
we utilize the RANSAC-PnP algorithm to compute the object's pose, addressing
the challenges associated with variable object scales in pose estimation.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach is not
only highly efficient but also achieves superior accuracy compared to previous
RGB-based methods. These promising results offer a new perspective for
advancing category-level object pose estimation using RGB images.

Result: 在条件生成任务中优于基线方法，在文本到图像生成、图像超分辨率和文本到语音生成等多个领域都取得了成功

Conclusion: DiffIER方法有效解决了训练-推理差距问题，提高了生成质量，具有广泛的适用性和应用潜力

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating
high-quality samples and enhancing performance across diverse domains through
Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG). However, the quality of generated samples is
highly sensitive to the selection of the guidance weight. In this work, we
identify a critical ``training-inference gap'' and we argue that it is the
presence of this gap that undermines the performance of conditional generation
and renders outputs highly sensitive to the guidance weight. We quantify this
gap by measuring the accumulated error during the inference stage and establish
a correlation between the selection of guidance weight and minimizing this gap.
Furthermore, to mitigate this gap, we propose DiffIER, an optimization-based
method for high-quality generation. We demonstrate that the accumulated error
can be effectively reduced by an iterative error minimization at each step
during inference. By introducing this novel plug-and-play optimization
framework, we enable the optimization of errors at every single inference step
and enhance generation quality. Empirical results demonstrate that our proposed
method outperforms baseline approaches in conditional generation tasks.
Furthermore, the method achieves consistent success in text-to-image
generation, image super-resolution, and text-to-speech generation, underscoring
its versatility and potential for broad applications in future research.

Abstract: Virtual Try-ON (VTON) is a practical and widely-applied task, for which most
of existing works focus on clothes. This paper presents OmniTry, a unified
framework that extends VTON beyond garment to encompass any wearable objects,
e.g., jewelries and accessories, with mask-free setting for more practical
application. When extending to various types of objects, data curation is
challenging for obtaining paired images, i.e., the object image and the
corresponding try-on result. To tackle this problem, we propose a two-staged
pipeline: For the first stage, we leverage large-scale unpaired images, i.e.,
portraits with any wearable items, to train the model for mask-free
localization. Specifically, we repurpose the inpainting model to automatically
draw objects in suitable positions given an empty mask. For the second stage,
the model is further fine-tuned with paired images to transfer the consistency
of object appearance. We observed that the model after the first stage shows
quick convergence even with few paired samples. OmniTry is evaluated on a
comprehensive benchmark consisting of 12 common classes of wearable objects,
with both in-shop and in-the-wild images. Experimental results suggest that
OmniTry shows better performance on both object localization and
ID-preservation compared with existing methods. The code, model weights, and
evaluation benchmark of OmniTry will be made publicly available at

Conclusion: DeH4R通过混合方法有效结合了图生成和图增长方法的优势，实现了高效、动态且拓扑保真的路网图提取，为遥感图像分析领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: The automated extraction of complete and precise road network graphs from
remote sensing imagery remains a critical challenge in geospatial computer
vision. Segmentation-based approaches, while effective in pixel-level
recognition, struggle to maintain topology fidelity after vectorization
postprocessing. Graph-growing methods build more topologically faithful graphs
but suffer from computationally prohibitive iterative ROI cropping.
Graph-generating methods first predict global static candidate road network
vertices, and then infer possible edges between vertices. They achieve fast
topology-aware inference, but limits the dynamic insertion of vertices. To
address these challenges, we propose DeH4R, a novel hybrid model that combines
graph-generating efficiency and graph-growing dynamics. This is achieved by
decoupling the task into candidate vertex detection, adjacent vertex
prediction, initial graph contruction, and graph expansion. This architectural
innovation enables dynamic vertex (edge) insertions while retaining fast
inference speed and enhancing both topology fidelity and spatial consistency.
Comprehensive evaluations on CityScale and SpaceNet benchmarks demonstrate
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. DeH4R outperforms the prior SOTA
graph-growing method RNGDet++ by 4.62 APLS and 10.18 IoU on CityScale, while
being approximately 10 $\times$ faster. The code will be made publicly
available at https://github.com/7777777FAN/DeH4R.

Method: 提出HumanPCR评估套件，包含三个层次：Human-P（感知）、Human-C（理解）和Human-R（推理）。前两个层级包含6000+人工验证的多选题，评估9个维度的任务；Human-R提供手动策划的视频推理测试，需要整合多个视觉证据并主动提取上下文

Abstract: The aspiration for artificial general intelligence, fueled by the rapid
progress of multimodal models, demands human-comparable performance across
diverse environments. We propose HumanPCR, an evaluation suite for probing
MLLMs' capacity about human-related visual contexts across three hierarchical
levels: Perception, Comprehension, and Reasoning (denoted by Human-P, Human-C,
and Human-R, respectively). Human-P and Human-C feature over 6,000
human-verified multiple choice questions, assessing massive tasks of 9
dimensions, including but not limited to essential skills frequently overlooked
by existing benchmarks. Human-R offers a challenging manually curated video
reasoning test that requires integrating multiple visual evidences, proactively
extracting context beyond question cues, and applying human-like expertise.
Each question includes human-annotated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rationales with
key visual evidence to support further research. Extensive evaluations on over
30 state-of-the-art models exhibit significant challenges in human-centric
visual understanding, particularly in tasks involving detailed space
perception, temporal understanding, and mind modeling. Moreover, analysis of
Human-R reveals the struggle of models in extracting essential proactive visual
evidence from diverse human scenes and their faulty reliance on query-guided
retrieval. Even with advanced techniques like scaling visual contexts and
test-time thinking yield only limited benefits. We hope HumanPCR and our
findings will advance the development, evaluation, and human-centric
application of multimodal models.

advanced state space models, represented by Mamba, have shown efficient
handling of long-range dependencies. This drives us to explore their potential
in semi-supervised medical image segmentation. In this paper, we propose a
novel Diversity-enhanced Collaborative Mamba framework (namely DCMamba) for
semi-supervised medical image segmentation, which explores and utilizes the
diversity from data, network, and feature perspectives. Firstly, from the data
perspective, we develop patch-level weak-strong mixing augmentation with
Mamba's scanning modeling characteristics. Moreover, from the network
perspective, we introduce a diverse-scan collaboration module, which could
benefit from the prediction discrepancies arising from different scanning
directions. Furthermore, from the feature perspective, we adopt an
uncertainty-weighted contrastive learning mechanism to enhance the diversity of
feature representation. Experiments demonstrate that our DCMamba significantly
outperforms other semi-supervised medical image segmentation methods, e.g.,
yielding the latest SSM-based method by 6.69% on the Synapse dataset with 20%
labeled data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于视觉-语言模型的层次结构方法，用于农业虚拟博物馆的表征和检索，并创建了包含457个农业主题虚拟博物馆的新数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在教育内容海量上传的背景下，如何组织和丰富这些内容以提高学习效果，尤其是通过Metaverse环境实现交互式教育体验时的相关场景搜索和匹配问题。

Method: 提出了一种层次视觉-语言模型，用于表征和通过自然语言查询检索相关的AgriMuseums（农业虚拟博物馆）。

Result: 在实验设置中，该方法达到了约62% R@1和78% MRR，证明了其有效性，并在现有基准上实现了最高达6% R@1和11% MRR的收益。

Conclusion: 这项研究为教育内容的组织和检索提供了有效的方法，尤其是在农业领域的虚拟博物馆检索任务中表现突出，为交互式教育体验的提升做出了贡献。

Abstract: Every day, a large amount of educational content is uploaded online across
different areas, including agriculture and gardening. When these videos or
materials are grouped meaningfully, they can make learning easier and more
effective. One promising way to organize and enrich such content is through the
Metaverse, which allows users to explore educational experiences in an
interactive and immersive environment. However, searching for relevant
Metaverse scenarios and finding those matching users' interests remains a
challenging task. A first step in this direction has been done recently, but
existing datasets are small and not sufficient for training advanced models. In
this work, we make two main contributions: first, we introduce a new dataset
containing 457 agricultural-themed virtual museums (AgriMuseums), each enriched
with textual descriptions; and second, we propose a hierarchical
vision-language model to represent and retrieve relevant AgriMuseums using
natural language queries. In our experimental setting, the proposed method
achieves up to about 62\% R@1 and 78\% MRR, confirming its effectiveness, and
it also leads to improvements on existing benchmarks by up to 6\% R@1 and 11\%
MRR. Moreover, an extensive evaluation validates our design choices. Code and

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该文章提出IPGA攻击方法，通过Q-Former中间层进行精细化的视觉-语言模型漏洞挖掘，在保持背景内容的同时实现更准确的对抗性操控


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有攻击方法在编码器层面上使用全局相似性，将丰富的视觉语义压缩为单一全局向量，导致攻击粒度不足，并忽视了项目器模块这个关键语义桥梁

Method: 提出IPGA攻击方法，利用Q-Former中间层将全局图像嵌入转换为粒度细化的视觉标记，进行更精确的对抗性扰动控制，同时提出殊止查询对齐(RQA)来保留无关视觉内容

Result: 在黑盒环境下，方法在全局图像描述任务和粒度细化的视觉问答任务中都较现有方法更优，并成功迁移到多个商业VLM模型上

Conclusion: IPGA通过利用项目器模块的中间表征，实现了更精细和有效的视觉-语言模型对抗性攻击，为VLM安全漏洞挖掘提供了新的视角

Abstract: Targeted adversarial attacks are essential for proactively identifying
security flaws in Vision-Language Models before real-world deployment. However,
current methods perturb images to maximize global similarity with the target
text or reference image at the encoder level, collapsing rich visual semantics
into a single global vector. This limits attack granularity, hindering
fine-grained manipulations such as modifying a car while preserving its
background. Furthermore, these methods largely overlook the projector module, a
critical semantic bridge between the visual encoder and the language model in
VLMs, thereby failing to disrupt the full vision-language alignment pipeline
within VLMs and limiting attack effectiveness. To address these issues, we
propose the Intermediate Projector Guided Attack (IPGA), the first method to
attack using the intermediate stage of the projector module, specifically the
widely adopted Q-Former, which transforms global image embeddings into
fine-grained visual features. This enables more precise control over
adversarial perturbations by operating on semantically meaningful visual tokens
rather than a single global representation. Specifically, IPGA leverages the
Q-Former pretrained solely on the first vision-language alignment stage,
without LLM fine-tuning, which improves both attack effectiveness and
transferability across diverse VLMs. Furthermore, we propose Residual Query
Alignment (RQA) to preserve unrelated visual content, thereby yielding more
controlled and precise adversarial manipulations. Extensive experiments show
that our attack method consistently outperforms existing methods in both
standard global image captioning tasks and fine-grained visual
question-answering tasks in black-box environment. Additionally, IPGA
successfully transfers to multiple commercial VLMs, including Google Gemini and
OpenAI GPT.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FOCUS是一种无需训练的解码策略，通过顺序掩码图像来防止多图像输入时的信息泄漏问题，显著提升多图像推理性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在单图像任务上表现良好，但在处理多图像输入时性能显著下降，因为不同图像的视觉线索在模型输出中相互干扰，出现跨图像信息泄漏问题

Method: 提出FOCUS解码策略：顺序将所有图像（除一个外）用随机噪声掩码，引导模型专注于单个干净图像；重复此过程获得部分掩码上下文下的logits，然后聚合并通过噪声参考输入进行对比精炼

Result: FOCUS在四个多图像基准测试和多种LVLM模型家族中一致提升性能

Conclusion: FOCUS提供了一种通用且实用的解决方案，无需额外训练或架构修改即可增强多图像推理能力

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate strong performance on
single-image tasks. However, we observe that their performance degrades
significantly when handling multi-image inputs. This occurs because visual cues
from different images become entangled in the model's output. We refer to this
phenomenon as cross-image information leakage. To address this issue, we
propose FOCUS, a training-free and architecture-agnostic decoding strategy that
mitigates cross-image information leakage during inference. FOCUS sequentially
masks all but one image with random noise, guiding the model to focus on the
single clean image. We repeat this process across all target images to obtain
logits under partially masked contexts. These logits are aggregated and then
contrastively refined using a noise-only reference input, which suppresses the
leakage and yields more accurate outputs. FOCUS consistently improves
performance across four multi-image benchmarks and diverse LVLM families. This
demonstrates that FOCUS offers a general and practical solution for enhancing
multi-image reasoning without additional training or architectural
modifications.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的多相机系统下的3D形状向二维关键点进行非粗结注册的方法，通过普通相机模型和凸优化等技术实现了更高精度的重建效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将多相机信息结合到形状模板重建（SfT）中，可以扩展医学成像和手持相机等应用场景的范围，通过多视角相互约束提高重建精度。

Method: 使用普通相机模型表示多相机系统，提出三种方法：知道空间点方向向量法、未知空间点但知道方向的方法、以及结合边缘信息的方法。重点使用凸优化程序解决对应问题。

Result: 在各种合成和实际数据上验证了方法的准确性，显示出较好的重建效果。

Conclusion: 这是首次为普通相机系统提供形状模板重建的解决方案，通过多视角约束显著提升了变形对象的重建精度。

Abstract: This article presents a new method for non-rigidly registering a 3D shape to
2D keypoints observed by a constellation of multiple cameras. Non-rigid
registration of a 3D shape to observed 2D keypoints, i.e., Shape-from-Template
(SfT), has been widely studied using single images, but SfT with information
from multiple-cameras jointly opens new directions for extending the scope of
known use-cases such as 3D shape registration in medical imaging and
registration from hand-held cameras, to name a few. We represent such
multi-camera setup with the generalised camera model; therefore any collection
of perspective or orthographic cameras observing any deforming object can be
registered. We propose multiple approaches for such SfT: the first approach
where the corresponded keypoints lie on a direction vector from a known 3D
point in space, the second approach where the corresponded keypoints lie on a
direction vector from an unknown 3D point in space but with known orientation
w.r.t some local reference frame, and a third approach where, apart from
correspondences, the silhouette of the imaged object is also known. Together,
these form the first set of solutions to the SfT problem with generalised
cameras. The key idea behind SfT with generalised camera is the improved
reconstruction accuracy from estimating deformed shape while utilising the
additional information from the mutual constraints between multiple views of a
deformed object. The correspondence-based approaches are solved with convex
programming while the silhouette-based approach is an iterative refinement of
the results from the convex solutions. We demonstrate the accuracy of our
proposed methods on many synthetic and real data

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么依赖手动定义的本构先验难以泛化到复杂场景，要么使用神经网络建模内在动力学导致可解释性差和泛化能力有限

Method: 上层采用LLMs驱动的解耦本构演化策略，LLMs作为物理专家生成和修订本构定律；下层使用视觉引导的本构评估机制，通过视觉模拟评估生成的本构定律与底层内在动力学的一致性

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，VisionLaw能有效从视觉观察中推断可解释的内在动力学，显著优于现有最先进方法，并在新场景的交互模拟中表现出强泛化能力

Conclusion: VisionLaw框架成功解决了内在动力学推断中的可解释性和泛化性问题，为物理交互模拟提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: The intrinsic dynamics of an object governs its physical behavior in the real
world, playing a critical role in enabling physically plausible interactive
simulation with 3D assets. Existing methods have attempted to infer the
intrinsic dynamics of objects from visual observations, but generally face two
major challenges: one line of work relies on manually defined constitutive
priors, making it difficult to generalize to complex scenarios; the other
models intrinsic dynamics using neural networks, resulting in limited
interpretability and poor generalization. To address these challenges, we
propose VisionLaw, a bilevel optimization framework that infers interpretable
expressions of intrinsic dynamics from visual observations. At the upper level,
we introduce an LLMs-driven decoupled constitutive evolution strategy, where
LLMs are prompted as a knowledgeable physics expert to generate and revise
constitutive laws, with a built-in decoupling mechanism that substantially
reduces the search complexity of LLMs. At the lower level, we introduce a
vision-guided constitutive evaluation mechanism, which utilizes visual
simulation to evaluate the consistency between the generated constitutive law
and the underlying intrinsic dynamics, thereby guiding the upper-level
evolution. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate
that VisionLaw can effectively infer interpretable intrinsic dynamics from
visual observations. It significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art
methods and exhibits strong generalization for interactive simulation in novel
scenarios.

Conclusion: Med-CTX为可信赖的多模态医学架构设立了新标准，临床文本在分割精度和解释质量中起关键作用，能够同时生成分割掩码、不确定性图和诊断依据

Abstract: We introduce Med-CTX, a fully transformer based multimodal framework for
explainable breast cancer ultrasound segmentation. We integrate clinical
radiology reports to boost both performance and interpretability. Med-CTX
achieves exact lesion delineation by using a dual-branch visual encoder that
combines ViT and Swin transformers, as well as uncertainty aware fusion.
Clinical language structured with BI-RADS semantics is encoded by
BioClinicalBERT and combined with visual features utilising cross-modal
attention, allowing the model to provide clinically grounded, model generated
explanations. Our methodology generates segmentation masks, uncertainty maps,
and diagnostic rationales all at once, increasing confidence and transparency
in computer assisted diagnosis. On the BUS-BRA dataset, Med-CTX achieves a Dice
score of 99% and an IoU of 95%, beating existing baselines U-Net, ViT, and
Swin. Clinical text plays a key role in segmentation accuracy and explanation
quality, as evidenced by ablation studies that show a -5.4% decline in Dice
score and -31% in CIDEr. Med-CTX achieves good multimodal alignment (CLIP
score: 85%) and increased confi dence calibration (ECE: 3.2%), setting a new
bar for trustworthy, multimodal medical architecture.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了TCA（时间步压缩攻击）框架，通过时间步级反向传播和对抗性膜电位重用技术，显著减少SNN对抗攻击的延迟达56%以上，同时保持攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的SNN对抗攻击方法（如FGSM和PGD扩展）存在严重的攻击延迟问题，无法满足实时应用需求，因为它们直接扩展ANN范式而未能充分利用SNN的关键特性。

Method: TCA框架包含两个核心组件：1）时间步级反向传播（TLBP）- 基于发现全局时间信息对攻击成功不关键，支持逐时间步评估和提前停止；2）对抗性膜电位重用（A-MPR）- 利用初始时间步膜电位积累的预热特性，可预计算和重用。

Result: 在VGG-11和ResNet-17模型上，使用CIFAR-10/100和CIFAR10-DVS数据集进行实验，TCA在白盒和黑盒设置下分别减少攻击延迟56.6%和57.1%，同时保持可比的攻击成功率。

Conclusion: TCA框架通过有效利用SNN的时间动态特性，显著降低了对抗攻击的计算延迟，为SNN在实时安全关键应用中的实用化提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) gradient-based adversarial attacks on spiking neural
networks (SNNs), which largely rely on extending FGSM and PGD frameworks, face
a critical limitation: substantial attack latency from multi-timestep
processing, rendering them infeasible for practical real-time applications.
This inefficiency stems from their design as direct extensions of ANN
paradigms, which fail to exploit key SNN properties. In this paper, we propose
the timestep-compressed attack (TCA), a novel framework that significantly
reduces attack latency. TCA introduces two components founded on key insights
into SNN behavior. First, timestep-level backpropagation (TLBP) is based on our
finding that global temporal information in backpropagation to generate
perturbations is not critical for an attack's success, enabling per-timestep
evaluation for early stopping. Second, adversarial membrane potential reuse
(A-MPR) is motivated by the observation that initial timesteps are
inefficiently spent accumulating membrane potential, a warm-up phase that can
be pre-calculated and reused. Our experiments on VGG-11 and ResNet-17 with the
CIFAR-10/100 and CIFAR10-DVS datasets show that TCA significantly reduces the
required attack latency by up to 56.6% and 57.1% compared to SOTA methods in
white-box and black-box settings, respectively, while maintaining a comparable
attack success rate.

Motivation: 城市树木生物多样性对气候适应和生态稳定至关重要，但传统量丰方法成本高而监督学习需要标签数据且突破地域限制

Method: 结合街道级图像的视觉嵌入与空间植装模式，通过无监督聚类方法估算属级生物多样性

Result: 在8个北美城市测试中，方法高保真度恢复了属级多样性模式，Shannon和Simpson指数的Wasserstein距离低，保持了空间自相关性

Conclusion: 该可扩展、细粒度方法能够在缺乏详细数据的城市进行生物多样性绘图，支持低成本直续监测和城市生态系统的遥适性管理

Abstract: Urban tree biodiversity is critical for climate resilience, ecological
stability, and livability in cities, yet most municipalities lack detailed
knowledge of their canopies. Field-based inventories provide reliable estimates
of Shannon and Simpson diversity but are costly and time-consuming, while
supervised AI methods require labeled data that often fail to generalize across
regions. We introduce an unsupervised clustering framework that integrates
visual embeddings from street-level imagery with spatial planting patterns to
estimate biodiversity without labels. Applied to eight North American cities,
the method recovers genus-level diversity patterns with high fidelity,
achieving low Wasserstein distances to ground truth for Shannon and Simpson
indices and preserving spatial autocorrelation. This scalable, fine-grained
approach enables biodiversity mapping in cities lacking detailed inventories
and offers a pathway for continuous, low-cost monitoring to support equitable
access to greenery and adaptive management of urban ecosystems.

Result: 在流行的跨域物体检测指标上达到最先进性能，超越了之前的state-of-the-art方法

Conclusion: SA3方法通过有效的对齐机制和识别策略，成功提升了跨域检测的性能和适应性

Abstract: Achieving top-notch performance in Intelligent Transportation detection is a
critical research area. However, many challenges still need to be addressed
when it comes to detecting in a cross-domain scenario. In this paper, we
propose a Self-Aware Adaptive Alignment (SA3), by leveraging an efficient
alignment mechanism and recognition strategy. Our proposed method employs a
specified attention-based alignment module trained on source and target domain
datasets to guide the image-level features alignment process, enabling the
local-global adaptive alignment between the source domain and target domain.
Features from both domains, whose channel importance is re-weighted, are fed
into the region proposal network, which facilitates the acquisition of salient
region features. Also, we introduce an instance-to-image level alignment module
specific to the target domain to adaptively mitigate the domain gap. To
evaluate the proposed method, extensive experiments have been conducted on
popular cross-domain object detection benchmarks. Experimental results show
that SA3 achieves superior results to the previous state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: 该新方法能够有效解决文本到图像生成中的对齐问题，提供了更高的控制粒度和空间对齐能力，且无需训练即可集成到现有架构中

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-image models produce visually impressive results but
often struggle with precise alignment to text prompts, leading to missing
critical elements or unintended blending of distinct concepts. We propose a
novel approach that learns a high-success-rate distribution conditioned on a
target prompt, ensuring that generated images faithfully reflect the
corresponding prompts. Our method explicitly models the signal component during
the denoising process, offering fine-grained control that mitigates
over-optimization and out-of-distribution artifacts. Moreover, our framework is
training-free and seamlessly integrates with both existing diffusion and flow
matching architectures. It also supports additional conditioning modalities --
such as bounding boxes -- for enhanced spatial alignment. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. The

Motivation: 现有增量学习评估多使用综合、简化的基准，隐藏了现实世界中的性能问题，需要更现实的评估标准

Method: 构建了两个现实增量学习目标检测基准：域RICO(D-RICO)包含域转移但类别固定，扩展类别RICO(EC-RICO)每步集成新域和新类别，基于14个多样数据集

Result: 所有增量学习方法在适应性和知识保持方面都表现不佳，重放少量旧数据即可超过所有方法，但仍不及单独训练的性能

Conclusion: 现有增量学习方法在现实场景下存在显著空白，应归因于蒸馈中弱老师、单模型无法管理多样任务以及不足的可塑性

Abstract: Incremental Learning (IL) trains models sequentially on new data without full
retraining, offering privacy, efficiency, and scalability. IL must balance
adaptability to new data with retention of old knowledge. However, evaluations
often rely on synthetic, simplified benchmarks, obscuring real-world IL
performance. To address this, we introduce two Realistic Incremental Object
Detection Benchmarks (RICO): Domain RICO (D-RICO) features domain shifts with a
fixed class set, and Expanding-Classes RICO (EC-RICO) integrates new domains
and classes per IL step. Built from 14 diverse datasets covering real and
synthetic domains, varying conditions (e.g., weather, time of day), camera
sensors, perspectives, and labeling policies, both benchmarks capture
challenges absent in existing evaluations. Our experiments show that all IL
methods underperform in adaptability and retention, while replaying a small
amount of previous data already outperforms all methods. However, individual
training on the data remains superior. We heuristically attribute this gap to
weak teachers in distillation, single models' inability to manage diverse
tasks, and insufficient plasticity. Our code will be made publicly available.

Motivation: 医学影像深度学习模型往往依赖虚假相关性而非临床有意义特征，在分布偏移下泛化能力差，需要一种轻量级、架构无关的方法来提升模型鲁棒性。

Result: 在合成和真实医学任务中验证有效：在受控数据集上显著提高对注入虚假相关性的鲁棒性；在糖尿病视网膜病变分类任务中提升合成扰动和OOD泛化性能。

Conclusion: LCRReg提供了一种无需密集概念监督的轻量级策略，优于多任务学习、线性探测和后处理概念模型等基线方法。

Abstract: Deep learning models in medical imaging often achieve strong in-distribution
performance but struggle to generalise under distribution shifts, frequently
relying on spurious correlations instead of clinically meaningful features. We
introduce LCRReg, a novel regularisation approach that leverages Latent Concept
Representations (LCRs) (e.g., Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs)) to guide
models toward semantically grounded representations. LCRReg requires no concept
labels in the main training set and instead uses a small auxiliary dataset to
synthesise high-quality, disentangled concept examples. We extract LCRs for
predefined relevant features, and incorporate a regularisation term that guides
a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to activate within latent subspaces
associated with those concepts. We evaluate LCRReg across synthetic and
real-world medical tasks. On a controlled toy dataset, it significantly
improves robustness to injected spurious correlations and remains effective
even in multi-concept and multiclass settings. On the diabetic retinopathy
binary classification task, LCRReg enhances performance under both synthetic
spurious perturbations and out-of-distribution (OOD) generalisation. Compared
to baselines, including multitask learning, linear probing, and post-hoc
concept-based models, LCRReg offers a lightweight, architecture-agnostic
strategy for improving model robustness without requiring dense concept
supervision. Code is available at the following link:

socio-economic impacts, primarily affecting the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) from
November to February. Over the past decade, increased air pollution sources
such as crop residue burning, motor vehicles, and changing weather patterns
have intensified these smog events. However, real-time forecasting systems for
increased particulate matter concentrations are still not established at
regional scale. The Aerosol Index, closely tied to smog formation and a key
component in calculating the Air Quality Index (AQI), reflects particulate
matter concentrations. This study forecasts aerosol events using Sentinel-5P
air constituent data (2019-2023) and a Convolutional Long-Short Term Memory
(ConvLSTM) neural network, which captures spatial and temporal correlations
more effectively than previous models. Using the Ultraviolet (UV) Aerosol Index
at 340-380 nm as the predictor, results show the Aerosol Index can be
forecasted at five-day intervals with a Mean Squared Error of ~0.0018, loss of
~0.3995, and Structural Similarity Index of ~0.74. While effective, the model
can be improved by integrating additional data and refining its architecture.

Conclusion: 通过创新地结合卷积操作和交叉注意机制，SCRNet能够同时抓取长程依赖关系和局部上下文信息，为医学超声图像分割提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Medical ultrasound image segmentation presents a formidable challenge in the
realm of computer vision. Traditional approaches rely on Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) and Transformer-based methods to address the intricacies of
medical image segmentation. Nevertheless, inherent limitations persist, as
CNN-based methods tend to disregard long-range dependencies, while
Transformer-based methods may overlook local contextual information. To address
these deficiencies, we propose a novel Feature Aggregation Module (FAM)
designed to process two input features from the preceding layer. These features
are seamlessly directed into two branches of the Convolution and
Cross-Attention Parallel Module (CCAPM) to endow them with different roles in
each of the two branches to help establish a strong connection between the two
input features. This strategy enables our module to focus concurrently on both
long-range dependencies and local contextual information by judiciously merging
convolution operations with cross-attention mechanisms. Moreover, by
integrating FAM within our proposed Spatial-Channel Regulation Module (SCRM),
the ability to discern salient regions and informative features warranting
increased attention is enhanced. Furthermore, by incorporating the SCRM into
the encoder block of the UNet architecture, we introduce a novel framework
dubbed Spatial-Channel Regulation Network (SCRNet). The results of our
extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of SCRNet, which consistently
achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: While physics-grounded 3D motion synthesis has seen significant progress,
current methods face critical limitations. They typically rely on
pre-reconstructed 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representations, while physics
integration depends on either inflexible, manually defined physical attributes
or unstable, optimization-heavy guidance from video models. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce PhysGM, a feed-forward framework that jointly predicts
a 3D Gaussian representation and its physical properties from a single image,
enabling immediate, physical simulation and high-fidelity 4D rendering. We
first establish a base model by jointly optimizing for Gaussian reconstruction
and probabilistic physics prediction. The model is then refined with physically
plausible reference videos to enhance both rendering fidelity and physics
prediction accuracy. We adopt the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to align
its simulations with reference videos, circumventing Score Distillation
Sampling (SDS) optimization which needs back-propagating gradients through the
complex differentiable simulation and rasterization. To facilitate the
training, we introduce a new dataset PhysAssets of over 24,000 3D assets,
annotated with physical properties and corresponding guiding videos.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively generates
high-fidelity 4D simulations from a single image in one minute. This represents
a significant speedup over prior works while delivering realistic rendering
results. Our project page is at:https://hihixiaolv.github.io/PhysGM.github.io/

Abstract: Image degradation caused by complex lighting conditions such as low-light and
backlit scenarios is commonly encountered in real-world environments,
significantly affecting image quality and downstream vision tasks. Most
existing methods focus on a single type of illumination degradation and lack
the ability to handle diverse lighting conditions in a unified manner. To
address this issue, we propose a dual-illumination enhancement framework called
DIME-Net. The core of our method is a Mixture-of-Experts illumination estimator
module, where a sparse gating mechanism adaptively selects suitable S-curve
expert networks based on the illumination characteristics of the input image.
By integrating Retinex theory, this module effectively performs enhancement
tailored to both low-light and backlit images. To further correct
illumination-induced artifacts and color distortions, we design a damage
restoration module equipped with Illumination-Aware Cross Attention and
Sequential-State Global Attention mechanisms. In addition, we construct a
hybrid illumination dataset, MixBL, by integrating existing datasets, allowing
our model to achieve robust illumination adaptability through a single training
process. Experimental results show that DIME-Net achieves competitive
performance on both synthetic and real-world low-light and backlit datasets
without any retraining. These results demonstrate its generalization ability
and potential for practical multimedia applications under diverse and complex
illumination conditions.

Result: 在各种挑战性测试集和多种FR模型上进行广泛实验，ViT-FIQA均稳定达到顶级性能

Conclusion: 识别了基于Transformer结构在建模面部图像效用性方面的有效性，展示了ViT作为未来FIQA研究可扩展基础的潜力

Abstract: Face Image Quality Assessment (FIQA) aims to predict the utility of a face
image for face recognition (FR) systems. State-of-the-art FIQA methods mainly
rely on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), leaving the potential of Vision
Transformer (ViT) architectures underexplored. This work proposes ViT-FIQA, a
novel approach that extends standard ViT backbones, originally optimized for
FR, through a learnable quality token designed to predict a scalar utility
score for any given face image. The learnable quality token is concatenated
with the standard image patch tokens, and the whole sequence is processed via
global self-attention by the ViT encoders to aggregate contextual information
across all patches. At the output of the backbone, ViT-FIQA branches into two
heads: (1) the patch tokens are passed through a fully connected layer to learn
discriminative face representations via a margin-penalty softmax loss, and (2)
the quality token is fed into a regression head to learn to predict the face
sample's utility. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks and several
FR models, including both CNN- and ViT-based architectures, demonstrate that
ViT-FIQA consistently achieves top-tier performance. These results underscore
the effectiveness of transformer-based architectures in modeling face image
utility and highlight the potential of ViTs as a scalable foundation for future
FIQA research https://cutt.ly/irHlzXUC.

TL;DR: 多模态大语言模型在图片旋转识别任务上表现差强，无法可靠区分90度和270度旋转，显示了与人类视觉理解能力的显著差距


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估MLLM模型在图片旋转识别任务上的视觉理解能力，这需要检测旋转线索和理解空间关系

Method: 构建RotBench标准数据集（350张图片），测试多个独立和闭源MLLM模型，使用辅助信息、思维链提示等方法来改善性能

Result: 模型能可靠识别0度（正常）图片，部分能识别180度（倒立）图片，但无法区分90度和270度旋转，细调也无法改善这一问题

Conclusion: MLLM模型在空间理解能力上与人类存在显著差距，旋转识别是一个具有挑战性的测试任务

Abstract: We investigate to what extent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) can
accurately identify the orientation of input images rotated 0{\deg}, 90{\deg},
180{\deg}, and 270{\deg}. This task demands robust visual reasoning
capabilities to detect rotational cues and contextualize spatial relationships
within images, regardless of their orientation. To evaluate MLLMs on these
abilities, we introduce RotBench -- a 350-image manually-filtered benchmark
comprising lifestyle, portrait, and landscape images. Despite the relatively
simple nature of this task, we show that several state-of-the-art open and
proprietary MLLMs, including GPT-5, o3, and Gemini-2.5-Pro, do not reliably
identify rotation in input images. Providing models with auxiliary information
-- including captions, depth maps, and more -- or using chain-of-thought
prompting offers only small and inconsistent improvements. Our results indicate
that most models are able to reliably identify right-side-up (0{\deg}) images,
while certain models are able to identify upside-down (180{\deg}) images. None
can reliably distinguish between 90{\deg} and 270{\deg}. Simultaneously showing
the image rotated in different orientations leads to moderate performance gains
for reasoning models, while a modified setup using voting improves the
performance of weaker models. We further show that fine-tuning does not improve
models' ability to distinguish 90{\deg} and 270{\deg} rotations, despite
substantially improving the identification of 180{\deg} images. Together, these
results reveal a significant gap between MLLMs' spatial reasoning capabilities
and human perception in identifying rotation.

Abstract: Depth estimation is a fundamental task for 3D scene understanding in
autonomous driving, robotics, and augmented reality. Existing depth datasets,
such as KITTI, nuScenes, and DDAD, have advanced the field but suffer from
limitations in diversity and scalability. As benchmark performance on these
datasets approaches saturation, there is an increasing need for a new
generation of large-scale, diverse, and cost-efficient datasets to support the
era of foundation models and multi-modal learning. To address these challenges,
we introduce a large-scale, diverse, frame-wise continuous dataset for depth
estimation in dynamic outdoor driving environments, comprising 20K video frames
to evaluate existing methods. Our lightweight acquisition pipeline ensures
broad scene coverage at low cost, while sparse yet statistically sufficient
ground truth enables robust training. Compared to existing datasets, ours
presents greater diversity in driving scenarios and lower depth density,
creating new challenges for generalization. Benchmark experiments with standard
monocular depth estimation models validate the dataset's utility and highlight
substantial performance gaps in challenging conditions, establishing a new
platform for advancing depth estimation research.

Abstract: Video action detection requires dense spatio-temporal annotations, which are
both challenging and expensive to obtain. However, real-world videos often vary
in difficulty and may not require the same level of annotation. This paper
analyzes the appropriate annotation types for each sample and their impact on
spatio-temporal video action detection. It focuses on two key aspects: 1) how
to obtain varying levels of annotation for videos, and 2) how to learn action
detection from different annotation types. The study explores video-level tags,
points, scribbles, bounding boxes, and pixel-level masks. First, a simple
active learning strategy is proposed to estimate the necessary annotation type
for each video. Then, a novel spatio-temporal 3D-superpixel approach is
introduced to generate pseudo-labels from these annotations, enabling effective
training. The approach is validated on UCF101-24 and JHMDB-21 datasets,
significantly cutting annotation costs with minimal performance loss.

Abstract: The design and analysis of pallet setups are essential for ensuring safety of

Result: 对象检测mAP提高26.6%，LiDAR预测Chamfer距离降低30.5%，感知范围达到250米

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了长距离感知的计算效率问题，为高速公路和重型车辆自动驾驶提供了可行的技术方案

Abstract: Outside of urban hubs, autonomous cars and trucks have to master driving on
intercity highways. Safe, long-distance highway travel at speeds exceeding 100
km/h demands perception distances of at least 250 m, which is about five times
the 50-100m typically addressed in city driving, to allow sufficient planning
and braking margins. Increasing the perception ranges also allows to extend
autonomy from light two-ton passenger vehicles to large-scale forty-ton trucks,
which need a longer planning horizon due to their high inertia. However, most
existing perception approaches focus on shorter ranges and rely on Bird's Eye
View (BEV) representations, which incur quadratic increases in memory and
compute costs as distance grows. To overcome this limitation, we built on top
of a sparse representation and introduced an efficient 3D encoding of
multi-modal and temporal features, along with a novel self-supervised
pre-training scheme that enables large-scale learning from unlabeled
camera-LiDAR data. Our approach extends perception distances to 250 meters and
achieves an 26.6% improvement in mAP in object detection and a decrease of
30.5% in Chamfer Distance in LiDAR forecasting compared to existing methods,
reaching distances up to 250 meters. Project Page:

Conclusion: 该研究提出的适应性视角选择方法能够有效提高3D高斯涂射模型的完整性，为在线RGB只框生成高质量3D模型提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: This study addresses the challenge of generating online 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS) models from RGB-only frames. Previous studies have employed dense SLAM
techniques to estimate 3D scenes from keyframes for 3DGS model construction.
However, these methods are limited by their reliance solely on keyframes, which
are insufficient to capture an entire scene, resulting in incomplete
reconstructions. Moreover, building a generalizable model requires
incorporating frames from diverse viewpoints to achieve broader scene coverage.
However, online processing restricts the use of many frames or extensive
training iterations. Therefore, we propose a novel method for high-quality 3DGS
modeling that improves model completeness through adaptive view selection. By
analyzing reconstruction quality online, our approach selects optimal
non-keyframes for additional training. By integrating both keyframes and
selected non-keyframes, the method refines incomplete regions from diverse
viewpoints, significantly enhancing completeness. We also present a framework
that incorporates an online multi-view stereo approach, ensuring consistency in
3D information throughout the 3DGS modeling process. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, delivering
exceptional performance in complex outdoor scenes.

Result: 在保持干净数据准确性的同时，实现了最先进的攻击性能，并对常见后门防御方法表现出鲁棒性

Conclusion: Noisy Alignment是一种简单而有效的数据中毒后门攻击方法，通过显式噪声对齐机制显著提升了攻击效果

Abstract: Self-supervised contrastive learning (CL) effectively learns transferable
representations from unlabeled data containing images or image-text pairs but
suffers vulnerability to data poisoning backdoor attacks (DPCLs). An adversary
can inject poisoned images into pretraining datasets, causing compromised CL
encoders to exhibit targeted misbehavior in downstream tasks. Existing DPCLs,
however, achieve limited efficacy due to their dependence on fragile implicit
co-occurrence between backdoor and target object and inadequate suppression of
discriminative features in backdoored images. We propose Noisy Alignment (NA),
a DPCL method that explicitly suppresses noise components in poisoned images.
Inspired by powerful training-controllable CL attacks, we identify and extract
the critical objective of noisy alignment, adapting it effectively into
data-poisoning scenarios. Our method implements noisy alignment by
strategically manipulating contrastive learning's random cropping mechanism,
formulating this process as an image layout optimization problem with
theoretically derived optimal parameters. The resulting method is simple yet
effective, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to existing DPCLs,
while maintaining clean-data accuracy. Furthermore, Noisy Alignment
demonstrates robustness against common backdoor defenses. Codes can be found at

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in video AIGC have ushered in a transformative era for
audio-driven human animation. However, conventional video dubbing techniques
remain constrained to mouth region editing, resulting in discordant facial
expressions and body gestures that compromise viewer immersion. To overcome
this limitation, we introduce sparse-frame video dubbing, a novel paradigm that
strategically preserves reference keyframes to maintain identity, iconic
gestures, and camera trajectories while enabling holistic, audio-synchronized
full-body motion editing. Through critical analysis, we identify why naive
image-to-video models fail in this task, particularly their inability to
achieve adaptive conditioning. Addressing this, we propose InfiniteTalk, a
streaming audio-driven generator designed for infinite-length long sequence
dubbing. This architecture leverages temporal context frames for seamless
inter-chunk transitions and incorporates a simple yet effective sampling
strategy that optimizes control strength via fine-grained reference frame
positioning. Comprehensive evaluations on HDTF, CelebV-HQ, and EMTD datasets
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Quantitative metrics confirm superior
visual realism, emotional coherence, and full-body motion synchronization.

Abstract: Modern 3D generation methods can rapidly create shapes from sparse or single

We introduce a token matching strategy that ensures accurate spatial
correspondence during refinement, enabling local detail synthesis while
preserving global structure. By carefully designing our training data to match
the characteristics of synthesized coarse shapes, our method can effectively
enhance shapes produced by various 3D generation and reconstruction approaches,
from single-view to sparse multi-view inputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that DetailGen3D achieves high-fidelity geometric detail synthesis while

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has exhibited remarkable efficacy in novel view
synthesis (NVS). However, it suffers from a significant drawback: achieving
high-fidelity rendering typically necessitates a large number of 3D Gaussians,
resulting in substantial memory consumption and storage requirements. To
address this challenge, we propose the first knowledge distillation framework
for 3DGS, featuring various teacher models, including vanilla 3DGS,
noise-augmented variants, and dropout-regularized versions. The outputs of
these teachers are aggregated to guide the optimization of a lightweight
student model. To distill the hidden geometric structure, we propose a
structural similarity loss to boost the consistency of spatial geometric
distributions between the student and teacher model. Through comprehensive
quantitative and qualitative evaluations across diverse datasets, the proposed
Distilled-3DGS, a simple yet effective framework without bells and whistles,
achieves promising rendering results in both rendering quality and storage
efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods. Project page:

Abstract: Composed video retrieval is a challenging task that strives to retrieve a
target video based on a query video and a textual description detailing
specific modifications. Standard retrieval frameworks typically struggle to
handle the complexity of fine-grained compositional queries and variations in
temporal understanding limiting their retrieval ability in the fine-grained
setting. To address this issue, we introduce a novel dataset that captures both
fine-grained and composed actions across diverse video segments, enabling more
detailed compositional changes in retrieved video content. The proposed
dataset, named Dense-WebVid-CoVR, consists of 1.6 million samples with dense
modification text that is around seven times more than its existing
counterpart. We further develop a new model that integrates visual and textual
information through Cross-Attention (CA) fusion using grounded text encoder,
enabling precise alignment between dense query modifications and target videos.
The proposed model achieves state-of-the-art results surpassing existing
methods on all metrics. Notably, it achieves 71.3\% Recall@1 in visual+text
setting and outperforms the state-of-the-art by 3.4\%, highlighting its
efficacy in terms of leveraging detailed video descriptions and dense
modification texts. Our proposed dataset, code, and model are available at

Abstract: This paper proposes PreSem-Surf, an optimized method based on the Neural
Radiance Field (NeRF) framework, capable of reconstructing high-quality scene
surfaces from RGB-D sequences in a short time. The method integrates RGB,
depth, and semantic information to improve reconstruction performance.
Specifically, a novel SG-MLP sampling structure combined with PR-MLP

distinguish noise from local details. Furthermore, progressive semantic
modeling is adopted to extract semantic information at increasing levels of
precision, reducing training time while enhancing scene understanding.
Experiments on seven synthetic scenes with six evaluation metrics show that
PreSem-Surf achieves the best performance in C-L1, F-score, and IoU, while

Abstract: We present a multi-level elastodynamics timestep solver for accelerating
incremental potential contact (IPC) simulations. Our method retains the
robustness of gold standard IPC in the face of intricate geometry, complex
heterogeneous material distributions and high resolution input data without
sacrificing visual fidelity (per-timestep relative displacement error of
$\approx1\%$). The success of our method is enabled by a novel, sparse,
geometry- and material-aware basis construction method which allows for the use
of fast preconditioned conjugate gradient solvers (in place of a sparse direct
solver), but without suffering convergence issues due to stiff or heterogeneous
materials. The end result is a solver that produces results visually
indistinguishable and quantitatively very close to gold-standard IPC methods
but up to $13\times$ faster on identical hardware.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于学习的方法需要将向量数据转换为栅格图像，使用图像生成模型后再转回向量数据，这个过程复杂冗余且会导致信息损失。栅格图像无法无损缩放，限制了生成质量。

Method: 提出Transformer-based的条件扩散模型，集成对齐机制来匹配设计师的迭代设计过程，直接在向量空间中处理复杂数据，实现用户可控生成。

Conclusion: DiffPlanner框架成功解决了传统方法的信息损失问题，在向量空间中实现了高质量的边界约束平面图生成，为用户提供了更好的控制能力。

Abstract: The boundary-constrained floor plan generation problem aims to generate the
topological and geometric properties of a set of rooms within a given boundary.
Recently, learning-based methods have made significant progress in generating
realistic floor plans. However, these methods involve a workflow of converting
vector data into raster images, using image-based generative models, and then
converting the results back into vector data. This process is complex and
redundant, often resulting in information loss. Raster images, unlike vector
data, cannot scale without losing detail and precision. To address these
issues, we propose a novel deep learning framework called DiffPlanner for
boundary-constrained floor plan generation, which operates entirely in vector
space. Our framework is a Transformer-based conditional diffusion model that
integrates an alignment mechanism in training, aligning the optimization
trajectory of the model with the iterative design processes of designers. This
enables our model to handle complex vector data, better fit the distribution of
the predicted targets, accomplish the challenging task of floor plan layout
design, and achieve user-controllable generation. We conduct quantitative
comparisons, qualitative evaluations, ablation experiments, and perceptual
studies to evaluate our method. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
DiffPlanner surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods in generating floor
plans and bubble diagrams in the creative stages, offering more controllability
to users and producing higher-quality results that closely match the ground
truths.

Result: 大量实验证明Sketch3DVE在视频编辑方面的优越性

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了大视角变化视频的3D结构编辑挑战，实现了精确的局部操作和逼真的编辑效果

Abstract: Recent video editing methods achieve attractive results in style transfer or
appearance modification. However, editing the structural content of 3D scenes
in videos remains challenging, particularly when dealing with significant
viewpoint changes, such as large camera rotations or zooms. Key challenges
include generating novel view content that remains consistent with the original
video, preserving unedited regions, and translating sparse 2D inputs into
realistic 3D video outputs. To address these issues, we propose Sketch3DVE, a
sketch-based 3D-aware video editing method to enable detailed local
manipulation of videos with significant viewpoint changes. To solve the
challenge posed by sparse inputs, we employ image editing methods to generate
edited results for the first frame, which are then propagated to the remaining
frames of the video. We utilize sketching as an interaction tool for precise
geometry control, while other mask-based image editing methods are also
supported. To handle viewpoint changes, we perform a detailed analysis and
manipulation of the 3D information in the video. Specifically, we utilize a
dense stereo method to estimate a point cloud and the camera parameters of the
input video. We then propose a point cloud editing approach that uses depth
maps to represent the 3D geometry of newly edited components, aligning them
effectively with the original 3D scene. To seamlessly merge the newly edited
content with the original video while preserving the features of unedited
regions, we introduce a 3D-aware mask propagation strategy and employ a video
diffusion model to produce realistic edited videos. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the superiority of Sketch3DVE in video editing. Homepage and code:

Conclusion: Is-NeRF通过显式光路建模和散射感知渲染，成功解决了传统NeRF在处理运动模糊和复杂光路时的局限性，为真实世界场景的高质量重建提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) has gained significant attention for its
prominent implicit 3D representation and realistic novel view synthesis
capabilities. Available works unexceptionally employ straight-line volume
rendering, which struggles to handle sophisticated lightpath scenarios and
introduces geometric ambiguities during training, particularly evident when
processing motion-blurred images. To address these challenges, this work
proposes a novel deblur neural radiance field, Is-NeRF, featuring explicit
lightpath modeling in real-world environments. By unifying six common light
propagation phenomena through an in-scattering representation, we establish a
new scattering-aware volume rendering pipeline adaptable to complex lightpaths.
Additionally, we introduce an adaptive learning strategy that enables
autonomous determining of scattering directions and sampling intervals to
capture finer object details. The proposed network jointly optimizes NeRF
parameters, scattering parameters, and camera motions to recover fine-grained
scene representations from blurry images. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate
that it effectively handles complex real-world scenarios, outperforming
state-of-the-art approaches in generating high-fidelity images with accurate
geometric details.

Conclusion: Diff-MSM不仅在人体肌肉骨骼建模和模拟方面有重要价值，还在肌肉健康监测、康复治疗和体育科学领域具有很大的应用潜力。

Abstract: High-fidelity personalized human musculoskeletal models are crucial for
simulating realistic behavior of physically coupled human-robot interactive
systems and verifying their safety-critical applications in simulations before
actual deployment, such as human-robot co-transportation and rehabilitation
through robotic exoskeletons. Identifying subject-specific Hill-type muscle
model parameters and bone dynamic parameters is essential for a personalized
musculoskeletal model, but very challenging due to the difficulty of measuring
the internal biomechanical variables in vivo directly, especially the joint
torques. In this paper, we propose using Differentiable MusculoSkeletal Model
(Diff-MSM) to simultaneously identify its muscle and bone parameters with an
end-to-end automatic differentiation technique differentiating from the
measurable muscle activation, through the joint torque, to the resulting
observable motion without the need to measure the internal joint torques.
Through extensive comparative simulations, the results manifested that our
proposed method significantly outperformed the state-of-the-art baseline
methods, especially in terms of accurate estimation of the muscle parameters
(i.e., initial guess sampled from a normal distribution with the mean being the
ground truth and the standard deviation being 10% of the ground truth could end
up with an average of the percentage errors of the estimated values as low as
0.05%). In addition to human musculoskeletal modeling and simulation, the new
parameter identification technique with the Diff-MSM has great potential to
enable new applications in muscle health monitoring, rehabilitation, and sports
science.

Abstract: We build a mobile surveillance robot that streams video in real time and

The system uses two Raspberry Pi 4 units: a front unit on a differential drive
base with camera, mic, and speaker, and a central unit that serves the live
feed and runs perception. Video is sent with FFmpeg. Objects in the scene are
detected using YOLOv3 to support navigation and event awareness. For voice
interaction, we use Python libraries for speech recognition, multilingual
translation, and text-to-speech, so the robot can take spoken commands and read
back responses in the requested language. A Kinect RGB-D sensor provides visual
input and obstacle cues. In indoor tests the robot detects common objects at
interactive frame rates on CPU, recognises commands reliably, and translates
them to actions without manual control. The design relies on off-the-shelf

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对越野自主驾驶等实时规划场景，传统Hybrid A*算法在复杂动力学下存在网格分辨率选择困境：过粗会导致规划失败，过细则导致扩展过多、规划缓慢。需要一种能够动态组织搜索、避免刚性剪枝的高效算法。

Method: 提出增量广义混合A* (IGHA*)框架，采用基于树的运动基元搜索，通过动态组织顶点扩展而非固定网格剪枝，实现近似剪枝效果。该算法具有随时性(anytime)特性，能够渐进式优化解质量。

Conclusion: IGHA*算法通过动态组织搜索有效解决了复杂动力学下的实时规划问题，在保证规划质量的同时显著提升效率，适用于自动驾驶和空中车辆等多种应用场景。

Abstract: We address the problem of efficiently organizing search over very large
trees, which arises in many applications ranging from autonomous driving to
aerial vehicles. Here, we are motivated by off-road autonomy, where real-time
planning is essential. Classical approaches use graphs of motion primitives and
exploit dominance to mitigate the curse of dimensionality and prune expansions
efficiently. However, for complex dynamics, repeatedly solving two-point
boundary-value problems makes graph construction too slow for fast kinodynamic
planning. Hybrid A* (HA*) addressed this challenge by searching over a tree of
motion primitives and introducing approximate pruning using a grid-based
dominance check. However, choosing the grid resolution is difficult: too coarse
risks failure, while too fine leads to excessive expansions and slow planning.
We propose Incremental Generalized Hybrid A* (IGHA*), an anytime tree-search
framework that dynamically organizes vertex expansions without rigid pruning.
IGHA* provably matches or outperforms HA*. For both on-road kinematic and
off-road kinodynamic planning queries for a car-like robot, variants of IGHA*
use 6x fewer expansions to the best solution compared to an optimized version
of HA*. In simulated off-road experiments in a high fidelity simulator, IGHA*
outperforms HA*M when both are used in the loop with a model predictive
controller. We demonstrate real-time performance both in simulation and on a
small-scale off-road vehicle, enabling fast, robust planning under complex
dynamics. Code: https://github.com/personalrobotics/IGHAStar

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法比其他解决非线性约束优化程序的算法更快完成规划

Conclusion: Benders分解技术能够有效地处理双足行走中的复杂混合整数规划问题，提高了规划效率

Abstract: Task and motion planning under Signal Temporal Logic constraints is known to
be NP-hard. A common class of approaches formulates these hybrid problems,
which involve discrete task scheduling and continuous motion planning, as
mixed-integer programs (MIP). However, in applications for bipedal locomotion,
introduction of non-convex constraints such as kinematic reachability and
footstep rotation exacerbates the computational complexity of MIPs. In this
work, we present a method based on Benders Decomposition to address scenarios
where solving the entire monolithic optimization problem is prohibitively
intractable. Benders Decomposition proposes an iterative cutting-plane
technique that partitions the problem into a master problem to prototype a plan
that meets the task specification, and a series of subproblems for kinematics
and dynamics feasibility checks. Our experiments demonstrate that this method
achieves faster planning compared to alternative algorithms for solving the
resulting optimization program with nonlinear constraints.

Conclusion: 利用视觉语言模型生成假想情境标签是一种有效的方法，可以显著提升机器人视觉-语言-动作模型的语言指令遵循能力，解决了现有数据集语言基础不足的问题

Abstract: Generalist robots should be able to understand and follow user instructions,
but current vision-language-action (VLA) models struggle with following
fine-grained commands despite providing a powerful architecture for mapping
open-vocabulary natural language instructions to robot actions. One cause for
this is a lack of semantic diversity and language grounding in existing robot
datasets and, specifically, a lack of fine-grained task diversity for similar
observations. To address this, we present a novel method to augment existing
robot datasets by leveraging vision language models to create counterfactual
labels. Our method improves the language-following capabilities of VLAs by
increasing the diversity and granularity of language grounding for robot
datasets by generating counterfactual language and actions. We evaluate the
resulting model's ability to follow language instructions, ranging from simple
object-centric commands to complex referential tasks, by conducting visual
language navigation experiments in 3 different indoor and outdoor environments.
Our experiments demonstrate that counterfactual relabeling, without any
additional data collection, significantly improves instruction-following in VLA
policies, making them competitive with state-of-the-art methods and increasing

Motivation: 解决全轮全向独立转向车辆(AWOISV)在复杂运动模式下的高精度控制问题，实现位置和航向角的同时跟随

Method: 提出基于时刻旋转中心理论的车轾半径角和侧滑角表征方法，建立了一般化动态模型，设计了继由器基线性时变MPC策略(FT-LTVMPC)

Result: 通过协同模拟和硬件在环实验验证，FT-LTVMPC策略能够实现高精度位置和航向角跟随控制，具有良好的实时性能

Conclusion: 该研究为AWOISV提供了一种有效的控制方法，能够在各种运动模式下实现高精度的位置和航向控制，具有强声的应用潜力

Abstract: An all-wheel omni-directional independent steering vehicle (AWOISV) is a
specialized all-wheel independent steering vehicle with each wheel capable of
steering up to 90{\deg}, enabling unique maneuvers like yaw and diagonal
movement. This paper introduces a theoretical steering radius angle and
sideslip angle (\( \theta_R \)-\(\beta_R \)) representation, based on the
position of the instantaneous center of rotation relative to the wheel rotation
center, defining the motion modes and switching criteria for AWOISVs. A
generalized \( v\)-\(\beta\)-\(r \) dynamic model is developed with forward
velocity \(v\), sideslip angle \(\beta\), and yaw rate \(r\) as states, and
\(\theta_R\) and \(\beta_R\) as control inputs. This model decouples
longitudinal and lateral motions into forward and rotational motions, allowing
seamless transitions across all motion modes under specific conditions. A
filtered tube-based linear time-varying MPC (FT-LTVMPC) strategy is proposed,
achieving simultaneous tracking of lateral position and arbitrary heading
angles, with robustness to model inaccuracies and parameter uncertainties.
Co-simulation and hardware-in-loop (HIL) experiments confirm that FT-LTVMPC
enables high-precision control of both position and heading while ensuring
excellent real-time performance.

Abstract: The ``Last Mile Challenge'' has long been considered an important, yet
unsolved, challenge for autonomous vehicles, public service robots, and
delivery robots. A central issue in this challenge is the ability of robots to
navigate constrained and cluttered environments (e.g., doorways, hallways,
corridor intersections), often while competing for space with other robots and
humans. We refer to these environments as ``Social Mini-Games'' (SMGs). SMGs
are tightly coupled, high-agency interactions that arise within general
multi-robot navigation (MRN) scenarios. They are identified through certain
distinct characteristics and require specialized metrics to evaluate them.
Traditional navigation approaches designed for MRN do not perform well in SMGs,
which has led to focused research on dedicated SMG solvers (navigation methods
specialized to navigate in SMGs), which has flourished in recent years.
However, publications on SMG navigation research make different assumptions (on
centralized versus decentralized, observability, communication, cooperation,
etc.), and have different objective functions (safety versus liveness). These
assumptions and objectives are sometimes implicitly assumed or described
informally. This makes it difficult to establish appropriate baselines for
comparison in research papers, as well as making it difficult for practitioners
to find the papers relevant to their concrete application. Such ad-hoc
representation of the field also presents a barrier to new researchers wanting
to start research in this area. SMG navigation research requires its own
taxonomy, definitions, and evaluation protocols to guide effective research
moving forward. This survey is the first to catalog SMG solvers using a
well-defined and unified taxonomy and to classify existing methods accordingly.

TL;DR: ROVER是一种利用历史轨迹作为先验约束的闭环检测验证方法，专门针对重复环境中外观特征失效的问题，通过轨迹优化和评分机制来拒绝错误闭环。


<details>

Motivation: 在重复性环境中，基于外观特征的闭环检测容易产生误检，现有方法主要关注学习不变的外观特征，而忽略了机器人的时空运动轨迹这一重要先验知识。

Method: 提出ROVER方法，对每个闭环候选首先进行位姿图优化估计轨迹，然后通过评分方案评估该轨迹与无闭环时的轨迹先验的符合程度，从而决定是否接受该闭环。

Result: 基准测试和真实世界实验证明了该方法的有效性，集成到最先进的SLAM系统中验证了其鲁棒性和效率。

Conclusion: 利用轨迹先验约束可以有效解决重复环境中的闭环验证问题，ROVER方法在挑战性环境中表现出色，代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: Loop closure detection is important for simultaneous localization and mapping
(SLAM), which associates current observations with historical keyframes,
achieving drift correction and global relocalization. However, a falsely
detected loop can be fatal, and this is especially difficult in repetitive
environments where appearance-based features fail due to the high similarity.
Therefore, verification of a loop closure is a critical step in avoiding false
positive detections. Existing works in loop closure verification predominantly
focus on learning invariant appearance features, neglecting the prior knowledge
of the robot's spatial-temporal motion cue, i.e., trajectory. In this letter,
we propose ROVER, a loop closure verification method that leverages the
historical trajectory as a prior constraint to reject false loops in
challenging repetitive environments. For each loop candidate, it is first used
to estimate the robot trajectory with pose-graph optimization. This trajectory
is then submitted to a scoring scheme that assesses its compliance with the
trajectory without the loop, which we refer to as the trajectory prior, to
determine if the loop candidate should be accepted. Benchmark comparisons and
real-world experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
Furthermore, we integrate ROVER into state-of-the-art SLAM systems to verify
its robustness and efficiency. Our source code and self-collected dataset are
available at https://github.com/jarvisyjw/ROVER.

TL;DR: 统一的层次模型预测控制方法，适用于不同形态的模块化操纵器，通过高级和低级MPC的分层结构提高控制精度和可靠性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决模块化操纵器在不同形态下控制器调参复杂的问题，实现无需大量参数调整的适配性控制

Method: 使用两层MPC结构：高级MPC预测未来状态和提供轨迹信息，低级MPC利用这些信息精炼控制动作并维持线性模型结构，同时捕捉动力学模型的二阶泰勒展开信息

Result: 在不同操纵器形态下进行了广泛评估，并在实际场景中成功执行了摘放任务，验证了控制策略的有效性

Conclusion: 该层次MPC方法不仅保持了线性控制模型的简洁性，还提高了运动学表示的准确性，从而提升了整体控制精度和可靠性，适用于多种模块化操纵器配置

Abstract: This work proposes a unified Hierarchical Model Predictive Control (H-MPC)
for modular manipulators across various morphologies, as the controller can
adapt to different configurations to execute the given task without extensive
parameter tuning in the controller. The H-MPC divides the control process into
two levels: a high-level MPC and a low-level MPC. The high-level MPC predicts
future states and provides trajectory information, while the low-level MPC
refines control actions by updating the predictive model based on this
high-level information. This hierarchical structure allows for the integration
of kinematic constraints and ensures smooth joint-space trajectories, even near
singular configurations. Moreover, the low-level MPC incorporates secondary
linearization by leveraging predictive information from the high-level MPC,
effectively capturing the second-order Taylor expansion information of the
kinematic model while still maintaining a linearized model formulation. This
approach not only preserves the simplicity of a linear control model but also
enhances the accuracy of the kinematic representation, thereby improving
overall control precision and reliability. To validate the effectiveness of the
control policy, we conduct extensive evaluations across different manipulator
morphologies and demonstrate the execution of pick-and-place tasks in
real-world scenarios.

Motivation: 解决有脚机器人在模型不确定性、外部干扰和故障条件下的稳定性和强锐性问题，传统两层控制框架对不确定性的处理能力有限。

Method: 首先提出新题移轨迹扩展状态观测器(MH-ESO)估计不确定性并减少噪声，然后构建三层次全身干扰控制框架(T-WB-DRC)，同时考虑无不确定性和有不确定性的动力学规划。

Result: 在Gazebo模拟器中对人形和四足机器人进行模拟，并在四足机器人上进行实验。结果表明该框架在各种干扰条件下都能提供优异的稳定性和强锐性。

Conclusion: T-WB-DRC框架通过更全面地考虑不确定性因素，显著提高了有脚机器人的负载运输能力、外部干扰抵抗能力和故障容耗性，为复杂环境下的机器人控制提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents a control framework designed to enhance the stability and
robustness of legged robots in the presence of uncertainties, including model
uncertainties, external disturbances, and faults. The framework enables the
full-state feedback estimator to estimate and compensate for uncertainties in
whole-body dynamics of the legged robots. First, we propose a novel moving
horizon extended state observer (MH-ESO) to estimate uncertainties and mitigate
noise in legged systems, which can be integrated into the framework for
disturbance compensation. Second, we introduce a three-level whole-body
disturbance rejection control framework (T-WB-DRC). Unlike the previous
two-level approach, this three-level framework considers both the plan based on
whole-body dynamics without uncertainties and the plan based on dynamics with
uncertainties, significantly improving payload transportation, external
disturbance rejection, and fault tolerance. Third, simulations of both humanoid
and quadruped robots in the Gazebo simulator demonstrate the effectiveness and
versatility of T-WB-DRC. Finally, extensive experimental trials on a quadruped
robot validate the robustness and stability of the system when using T-WB-DRC
under various disturbance conditions.

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种无需密集遥操作数据收集的可扩展方案，实现了单次泛化能力，为机器人工具操作技能学习提供了新途径

Abstract: Imitating tool manipulation from human videos offers an intuitive approach to
teaching robots, while also providing a promising and scalable alternative to
labor-intensive teleoperation data collection for visuomotor policy learning.
While humans can mimic tool manipulation behavior by observing others perform a
task just once and effortlessly transfer the skill to diverse tools for
functionally equivalent tasks, current robots struggle to achieve this level of
generalization. A key challenge lies in establishing function-level
correspondences, considering the significant geometric variations among
functionally similar tools, referred to as intra-function variations. To
address this challenge, we propose MimicFunc, a framework that establishes
functional correspondences with function frame, a function-centric local
coordinate frame constructed with keypoint-based abstraction, for imitating
tool manipulation skills. Experiments demonstrate that MimicFunc effectively
enables the robot to generalize the skill from a single RGB-D human video to
manipulating novel tools for functionally equivalent tasks. Furthermore,
leveraging MimicFunc's one-shot generalization capability, the generated
rollouts can be used to train visuomotor policies without requiring
labor-intensive teleoperation data collection for novel objects. Our code and
video are available at https://sites.google.com/view/mimicfunc.

TL;DR: 研究调查了自主清扫机器人类型和运动模式对分心和未分心行人行走行为的影响。发现机器人大小和运动模式比行人是否分心更能影响行人的身体调整行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着自主机器人在公共空间的普及，与普通人员的偶遇更加频繁。机器人需要具备有效的沟通策略来提高透明度和减少危险情况。当前研究对分心行人在机器人身边的行为关注不够。

Method: 在现场环境中视频记录了N=498名未知情的行人穿过两个正在工作的自主清扫机器人时的行为。约有8%的行人在使用手机而分心。比较了不同机器人类型（大型清扫机器人 vs 小型清扫机器人）和不同运动模式（偏移矩形运动 vs 圆形运动）的影响。

Result: 分心和未分心行人在机器人附近的运动行为没有显著差异。大型清扫机器人比小型机器人导致更多的侧向调整行为。偏移矩形运动模式比圆形运动模式导致更多的侧向调整和更多的近距离侧向调整。不同机器类型下的运动模式导致了不同距离的侧向调整。

Conclusion: 研究为公共空间中行人在自主清扫机器人附近的行为提供了初步见解，对人机交互研究领域做出了贡献。机器人的物理特征（大小）和运动模式比行人是否分心更能影响行人的身体调整行为。

Abstract: As autonomous robots become more common in public spaces, spontaneous
encounters with laypersons are more frequent. For this, robots need to be
equipped with communication strategies that enhance momentary transparency and
reduce the probability of critical situations. Adapting these robotic
strategies requires consideration of robot movements, environmental conditions,
and user characteristics and states. While numerous studies have investigated
the impact of distraction on pedestrians' movement behavior, limited research
has examined this behavior in the presence of autonomous robots. This research
addresses the impact of robot type and robot movement pattern on distracted and
undistracted pedestrians' movement behavior. In a field setting, unaware
pedestrians were videotaped while moving past two working, autonomous cleaning
robots. Out of N=498 observed pedestrians, approximately 8% were distracted by
smartphones. Distracted and undistracted pedestrians did not exhibit
significant differences in their movement behaviors around the robots. Instead,
both the larger sweeping robot and the offset rectangular movement pattern
significantly increased the number of lateral adaptations compared to the
smaller cleaning robot and the circular movement pattern. The offset
rectangular movement pattern also led to significantly more close lateral
adaptations. Depending on the robot type, the movement patterns led to
differences in the distances of lateral adaptations. The study provides initial
insights into pedestrian movement behavior around an autonomous cleaning robot
in public spaces, contributing to the growing field of HRI research.

Conclusion: DIPPeR机器人提供了一种高效、精确的开采矿山爆破孔自动检测方案，能够大幅节省材料处理成本，为矿山自动化检测领域提供了可靠技术支撑

Abstract: In open-pit mining, holes are drilled into the surface of the excavation site
and detonated with explosives to facilitate digging. These blast holes need to
be inspected internally for investigation of downhole material types and
properties. Knowing these properties can lead to significant savings in
material handling costs in downstream processes. Manual hole inspection is slow
and expensive, with major limitations in revealing the geometric and geological
properties of the holes and their contents. This has been the motivation for
the development of our autonomous mine-site inspection robot - "DIPPeR". In
this paper, the automation aspect of the project is explained. We present a
robust blast hole seeking and detection framework that enables target-based
navigation and accurate down-hole sensor positioning. The pipeline first
processes point-cloud data collected by the on-board LiDAR sensors, extracting
the cone-shaped volume of drill-waste above the ground. By projecting the 3D
cone points into a virtual depth image, segmentation is achieved in the 2D
domain, yielding a circular hole at the image centre and a collared cone face.
We then identify the hole centre using a robust detection module while
suppressing non-maximum candidates, ensuring precise sensor placement for
down-hole inspection and avoiding collisions with the cavity wall. To enable
autonomous hole-seeking, the pipeline automatically adjusts its projection
parameters during robot navigation to account for variations in point sparsity
and hole opening size, ensuring a consistent hole appearance in 2D images. This
allows continuous tracking of the target hole as the robot approaches the goal
point. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our navigation and perception system
in both high-fidelity simulation environments and on-site field tests. A
demonstration video is available at

Conclusion: Koopman基于学习方法能够有效处理复杂四旋翼动力学，满足嵌入式飞行控制的实时要求，为高效控制提供了新方案

Abstract: This paper presents a data-driven control framework for quadrotor systems
that integrates a deep Koopman operator with model predictive control (DK-MPC).
The deep Koopman operator is trained on sampled flight data to construct a
high-dimensional latent representation in which the nonlinear quadrotor
dynamics are approximated by linear models. This linearization enables the
application of MPC to efficiently optimize control actions over a finite
prediction horizon, ensuring accurate trajectory tracking and stabilization.
The proposed DK-MPC approach is validated through a series of
trajectory-following and point-stabilization numerical experiments, where it
demonstrates superior tracking accuracy and significantly lower computation
time compared to conventional nonlinear MPC. These results highlight the
potential of Koopman-based learning methods to handle complex quadrotor
dynamics while meeting the real-time requirements of embedded flight control.
Future work will focus on extending the framework to more agile flight
scenarios and improving robustness against external disturbances.

Conclusion: 分层架构实现了结构化、可解释和可泛化的复杂多机器人协作决策

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated great potential in robotic
operations. However, its data-intensive nature and reliance on the Markov
Decision Process (MDP) assumption limit its practical deployment in real-world
scenarios involving complex dynamics and long-term temporal dependencies, such
as multi-robot manipulation. Decision Transformers (DTs) have emerged as a
promising offline alternative by leveraging causal transformers for sequence
modeling in RL tasks. However, their applications to multi-robot manipulations
still remain underexplored. To address this gap, we propose a novel framework,
Symbolically-Guided Decision Transformer (SGDT), which integrates a
neuro-symbolic mechanism with a causal transformer to enable deployable
multi-robot collaboration. In the proposed SGDT framework, a neuro-symbolic
planner generates a high-level task-oriented plan composed of symbolic
subgoals. Guided by these subgoals, a goal-conditioned decision transformer
(GCDT) performs low-level sequential decision-making for multi-robot
manipulation. This hierarchical architecture enables structured, interpretable,
and generalizable decision making in complex multi-robot collaboration tasks.
We evaluate the performance of SGDT across a range of task scenarios, including
zero-shot and few-shot scenarios. To our knowledge, this is the first work to
explore DT-based technology for multi-robot manipulation.

Method: 1）提出DriBehavGPT，一个基于LLM的交互模块，生成自然语言驾驶行为描述
2）通过文本嵌入和降维技术将这些描述转换为机器学习可处理的表征

Conclusion: 语义行为表征在提高识别准确性方面发挥了关键作用，同时推进了可解释性、以人为本的驾驶系统的发展。

Abstract: Existing driving style recognition systems largely depend on low-level
sensor-derived features for training, neglecting the rich semantic reasoning
capability inherent to human experts. This discrepancy results in a fundamental
misalignment between algorithmic classifications and expert judgments. To
bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework that integrates Semantic
Privileged Information (SPI) derived from large language models (LLMs) to align
recognition outcomes with human-interpretable reasoning. First, we introduce
DriBehavGPT, an interactive LLM-based module that generates natural-language
descriptions of driving behaviors. These descriptions are then encoded into
machine learning-compatible representations via text embedding and
dimensionality reduction. Finally, we incorporate them as privileged
information into Support Vector Machine Plus (SVM+) for training, enabling the
model to approximate human-like interpretation patterns. Experiments across
diverse real-world driving scenarios demonstrate that our SPI-enhanced
framework outperforms conventional methods, achieving F1-score improvements of
7.6% (car-following) and 7.9% (lane-changing). Importantly, SPI is exclusively
used during training, while inference relies solely on sensor data, ensuring
computational efficiency without sacrificing performance. These results
highlight the pivotal role of semantic behavioral representations in improving
recognition accuracy while advancing interpretable, human-centric driving
systems.

Abstract: As robots get more integrated into human environments, fostering
trustworthiness in embodied robotic agents becomes paramount for an effective
and safe human-robot interaction (HRI). To achieve that, HRI applications must
promote human trust that aligns with robot skills and avoid misplaced trust or
overtrust, which can pose safety risks and ethical concerns. To achieve that,
HRI applications must promote human trust that aligns with robot skills and
avoid misplaced trust or overtrust, which can pose safety risks and ethical
concerns. In this position paper, we outline an interaction-based framework for
building trust through mutual understanding between humans and robots. We
emphasize two main pillars: human awareness and transparency, referring to the
robot ability to interpret human actions accurately and to clearly communicate
its intentions and goals, respectively. By integrating these two pillars,
robots can behave in a manner that aligns with human expectations and needs
while providing their human partners with both comprehension and control over
their actions. We also introduce four components that we think are important
for bridging the gap between a human-perceived sense of trust and a robot true
capabilities.

Abstract: The Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) community often highlights the social
context of an interaction as a key consideration when designing, implementing,
and evaluating robot behavior. Unfortunately, researchers use the term "social
context" in varied ways. This can lead to miscommunication, making it
challenging to draw connections between related work on understanding and
modeling the social contexts of human-robot interactions. To address this gap,
we survey the HRI literature for existing definitions and uses of the term
"social context". Then, we propose a conceptual model for describing the social
context of a human-robot interaction. We apply this model to existing work, and
we discuss a range of attributes of social contexts that can help researchers
plan for interactions, develop behavior models for robots, and gain insights
after interactions have taken place. We conclude with a discussion of open
research questions in relation to understanding and modeling the social
contexts of human-robot interactions.

Abstract: Generalization in embodied AI is hindered by the "seeing-to-doing gap," which
stems from data scarcity and embodiment heterogeneity. To address this, we
pioneer "pointing" as a unified, embodiment-agnostic intermediate
representation, defining four core embodied pointing abilities that bridge
high-level vision-language comprehension with low-level action primitives. We
introduce Embodied-R1, a 3B Vision-Language Model (VLM) specifically designed
for embodied reasoning and pointing. We use a wide range of embodied and
general visual reasoning datasets as sources to construct a large-scale
dataset, Embodied-Points-200K, which supports key embodied pointing
capabilities. We then train Embodied-R1 using a two-stage Reinforced
Fine-tuning (RFT) curriculum with a specialized multi-task reward design.
Embodied-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance on 11 embodied spatial and
pointing benchmarks. Critically, it demonstrates robust zero-shot
generalization by achieving a 56.2% success rate in the SIMPLEREnv and 87.5%
across 8 real-world XArm tasks without any task-specific fine-tuning,
representing a 62% improvement over strong baselines. Furthermore, the model
exhibits high robustness against diverse visual disturbances. Our work shows
that a pointing-centric representation, combined with an RFT training paradigm,
offers an effective and generalizable pathway to closing the perception-action
gap in robotics.

Abstract: Realizing generalizable dynamic object manipulation is important for
enhancing manufacturing efficiency, as it eliminates specialized engineering
for various scenarios. To this end, imitation learning emerges as a promising
paradigm, leveraging expert demonstrations to teach a policy manipulation
skills. Although the generalization of an imitation learning policy can be
improved by increasing demonstrations, demonstration collection is
labor-intensive. To address this problem, this paper investigates whether
strong generalization in dynamic object manipulation is achievable with only a
few demonstrations. Specifically, we develop an entropy-based theoretical
framework to quantify the optimization of imitation learning. Based on this
framework, we propose a system named Generalizable Entropy-based Manipulation
(GEM). Extensive experiments in simulated and real tasks demonstrate that GEM
can generalize across diverse environment backgrounds, robot embodiments,
motion dynamics, and object geometries. Notably, GEM has been deployed in a
real canteen for tableware collection. Without any in-scene demonstration, it
achieves a success rate of over 97% across more than 10,000 operations.
