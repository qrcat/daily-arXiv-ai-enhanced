For analysis and visualization, topological primitives such as\ncontour trees can be used, but these often need simplification to filter out\nsmall-scale features. For parcel-based convective cloud simulations,\nsimplification of the contour tree requires a volumetric measure rather than\npersistence. Unlike for cubic meshes, volume cannot be approximated by counting\nregular vertices. Typically, this is addressed by resampling irregular data\nonto a uniform grid. Unfortunately, the spatial proximity of parcels requires a\nhigh sampling frequency, resulting in a massive increase in data size for\nprocessing. We therefore extend volume-based contour tree simplification to\nparcel-in-cell simulations with a graph adaptor in Viskores (VTK-m), using\nDelaunay tetrahedralization of the parcel centroids as input. Instead of\nrelying on a volume approximation by counting regular vertices -- as was done\nfor cubic meshes -- we adapt the 2D area splines reported by Bajaj et al.\n10.1145/259081.259279, and Zhou et al. 10.1109/TVCG.2018.2796555.

Existing HOI generation approaches, such as\ndiffusion-based models, often suffer from artifacts such as implausible\ncontacts, penetrations, and unrealistic whole-body actions, which hinder\nsuccessful execution in physical environments. To address these challenges, we\nintroduce SimGenHOI, a unified framework that combines the strengths of\ngenerative modeling and reinforcement learning to produce controllable and\nphysically plausible HOI. Our HOI generative model, based on Diffusion\nTransformers (DiT), predicts a set of key actions conditioned on text prompts,\nobject geometry, sparse object waypoints, and the initial humanoid pose. These\nkey actions capture essential interaction dynamics and are interpolated into\nsmooth motion trajectories, naturally supporting long-horizon generation. To\nensure physical realism, we design a contact-aware whole-body control policy\ntrained with reinforcement learning, which tracks the generated motions while\ncorrecting artifacts such as penetration and foot sliding. Furthermore, we\nintroduce a mutual fine-tuning strategy, where the generative model and the\ncontrol policy iteratively refine each other, improving both motion realism and\ntracking robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SimGenHOI generates\nrealistic, diverse, and physically plausible humanoid-object interactions,\nachieving significantly higher tracking success rates in simulation and\nenabling long-horizon manipulation tasks.

To address this limitation, we propose\nHRC-Pose, a novel depth-only framework for category-level object pose\nestimation, which leverages contrastive learning to learn point cloud\nrepresentations that preserve the continuity of 6D poses. HRC-Pose decouples\nobject pose into rotation and translation components, which are separately\nencoded and leveraged throughout the network. Specifically, we introduce a\ncontrastive learning strategy for multi-task, multi-category scenarios based on\nour 6D pose-aware hierarchical ranking scheme, which contrasts point clouds\nfrom multiple categories by considering rotational and translational\ndifferences as well as categorical information. We further design pose\nestimation modules that separately process the learned rotation-aware and\ntranslation-aware embeddings.

To overcome these, we propose ScenGE, a\nframework that can generate plentiful safety-critical scenarios by reasoning\nnovel adversarial cases and then amplifying them with complex traffic flows.\nGiven a simple prompt of a benign scene, it first performs Meta-Scenario\nGeneration, where a large language model, grounded in structured driving\nknowledge, infers an adversarial agent whose behavior poses a threat that is\nboth plausible and deliberately challenging.

With Virtual Community, we aim to study embodied social intelligence at\nscale: 1) How robots can intelligently cooperate or compete; 2) How humans\ndevelop social relations and build community; 3) More importantly, how\nintelligent robots and humans can co-exist in an open world. To support these,\nVirtual Community features: 1) An open-source multi-agent physics simulator\nthat supports robots, humans, and their interactions within a society; 2) A\nlarge-scale, real-world aligned community generation pipeline, including vast\noutdoor space, diverse indoor scenes, and a community of grounded agents with\nrich characters and appearances. Leveraging Virtual Community, we propose two\nnovel challenges. The Community Planning Challenge evaluates multi-agent\nreasoning and planning ability in open-world settings, such as cooperating to\nhelp agents with daily activities and efficiently connecting other agents. The\nCommunity Robot Challenge requires multiple heterogeneous robots to collaborate\nin solving complex open-world tasks. We evaluate various baselines on these\ntasks and demonstrate the challenges in both high-level open-world task\nplanning and low-level cooperation controls. We hope that Virtual Community\nwill unlock further study of human-robot coexistence within open-world\nenvironments."}

Display-camera imaging systems offer unique advantages for this task:\neach pixel can easily function as a programmable point light source, and the\npolarized light emitted by LCD displays facilitates diffuse-specular\nseparation. Despite these benefits, there is currently no public real-world\ndataset captured using display-camera systems, unlike other setups such as\nlight stages. This absence hinders the development and evaluation of\ndisplay-based inverse rendering methods. In this paper, we introduce the first\nreal-world dataset for display-based inverse rendering. To achieve this, we\nconstruct and calibrate an imaging system comprising an LCD display and stereo\npolarization cameras. We then capture a diverse set of objects with diverse\ngeometry and reflectance under one-light-at-a-time (OLAT) display patterns. We\nalso provide high-quality ground-truth geometry. Our dataset enables the\nsynthesis of captured images under arbitrary display patterns and different\nnoise levels. Using this dataset, we evaluate the performance of existing\nphotometric stereo and inverse rendering methods, and provide a simple, yet\neffective baseline for display inverse rendering, outperforming\nstate-of-the-art inverse rendering methods.

However, existing methods often\nrely on limited domain-specific languages (DSLs) and small-scale datasets,\nrestricting their ability to model complex geometries and structures. To\naddress these challenges, we introduce MeshCoder, a novel framework that\nreconstructs complex 3D objects from point clouds into editable Blender Python\nscripts. We develop a comprehensive set of expressive Blender Python APIs\ncapable of synthesizing intricate geometries. Leveraging these APIs, we\nconstruct a large-scale paired object-code dataset, where the code for each\nobject is decomposed into distinct semantic parts. Subsequently, we train a\nmultimodal large language model (LLM) that translates 3D point cloud into\nexecutable Blender Python scripts. Our approach not only achieves superior\nperformance in shape-to-code reconstruction tasks but also facilitates\nintuitive geometric and topological editing through convenient code\nmodifications. Furthermore, our code-based representation enhances the\nreasoning capabilities of LLMs in 3D shape understanding tasks. Together, these\ncontributions establish MeshCoder as a powerful and flexible solution for\nprogrammatic 3D shape reconstruction and understanding."}

In this paper, we propose\na quite challenging but valuable task to reconstruct the human body from only\ntwo images, i.e., the front and back view, which can largely lower the barrier\nfor users to create their own 3D digital humans. The main challenges lie in the\ndifficulty of building 3D consistency and recovering missing information from\nthe highly sparse input. We redesign a geometry reconstruction model based on\nfoundation reconstruction models to predict consistent point clouds even input\nimages have scarce overlaps with extensive human data training. Furthermore, an\nenhancement algorithm is applied to supplement the missing color information,\nand then the complete human point clouds with colors can be obtained, which are\ndirectly transformed into 3D Gaussians for better rendering quality.\nExperiments show that our method can reconstruct the entire human in 190 ms on\na single NVIDIA RTX 4090, with two images at a resolution of 1024x1024,\ndemonstrating state-of-the-art performance on the THuman2.0 and cross-domain\ndatasets. Additionally, our method can complete human reconstruction even with\nimages captured by low-cost mobile devices, reducing the requirements for data\ncollection.
