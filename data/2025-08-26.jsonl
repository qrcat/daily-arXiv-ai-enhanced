A dual-encoder fusion network is then employed to jointly extract\ncomplementary features from the reprojected iToF depth and RGB image, guided by\nmonocular depth priors to recover fine-grained structural details and perform\ndepth super-resolution.

To\nsatisfy the first requirement, we never change the position of the vertices.\nRegarding the second requirement, we avoid edge crossings in each frame. More\nprecisely, in the first frame we visualize a suitable subset of non-crossing\nedges; in each subsequent frame, exactly one new edge enters the visualization\nand all the edges that cross with it are deleted.

However, significant challenges arise when implementing\npath velocity decomposition (PVD) trajectory planning for automated parking.\nThe primary challenge is ensuring rapid and precise collision-free trajectory\nplanning, which is often in conflict. The secondary challenge involves\nmaintaining sufficient control feasibility of the planned trajectory,\nparticularly at gear shifting points (GSP). This paper proposes a PVD-based\nrapid iterative trajectory planning (RITP) method to solve the above\nchallenges. The proposed method effectively balances the necessity for time\nefficiency and precise collision avoidance through a novel collision avoidance\nframework. Moreover, it enhances the overall control feasibility of the planned\ntrajectory by incorporating the vehicle kinematics model and including terminal\nsmoothing constraints (TSC) at GSP during path planning. Specifically, the\nproposed method leverages differential flatness to ensure the planned path\nadheres to the vehicle kinematic model. Additionally, it utilizes TSC to\nmaintain curvature continuity at GSP, thereby enhancing the control feasibility\nof the overall trajectory. The simulation results demonstrate superior time\nefficiency and tracking errors compared to model-integrated and other\niteration-based trajectory planning methods. In the real-world experiment, the\nproposed method was implemented and validated on a ROS-based vehicle,\ndemonstrating the applicability of the RITP method for real vehicles."}

The established image-based world\nmodels and policies have shown prior success, but lack robust geometric\ninformation that requires consistent spatial and physical understanding of the\nthree-dimensional world, even pre-trained on internet-scale video sources. To\nthis end, we propose a novel branch of world model named Gaussian World Model\n(GWM) for robotic manipulation, which reconstructs the future state by\ninferring the propagation of Gaussian primitives under the effect of robot\nactions. At its core is a latent Diffusion Transformer (DiT) combined with a 3D\nvariational autoencoder, enabling fine-grained scene-level future state\nreconstruction with Gaussian Splatting. GWM can not only enhance the visual\nrepresentation for imitation learning agent by self-supervised future\nprediction training, but can serve as a neural simulator that supports\nmodel-based reinforcement learning. Both simulated and real-world experiments\ndepict that GWM can precisely predict future scenes conditioned on diverse\nrobot actions, and can be further utilized to train policies that outperform\nthe state-of-the-art by impressive margins, showcasing the initial data scaling\npotential of 3D world model."}

Methods: Forty-two surgical novices learned a virtual version of the\nring-on-wire task, a canonical task in RMIS training. We investigated the\nimpact of feedback timing with multi-sensory (haptic and visual) cues in three\ngroups: (1) real-time error feedback, (2) trial replay with error feedback, and\n(3) no error feedback. Results: Participant performance was evaluated based on\nthe accuracy of ring position and orientation during the task.

Although recent hardware technological\nbreakthroughs, along with state-of-the-art rendering technologies, have\nsignificantly improved the visual realism of video games, achieving true\nphotorealism in dynamic environments at real-time frame rates still remains a\nmajor challenge due to the tradeoff between visual quality and performance. In\nthis short paper, we present a novel approach for enhancing the photorealism of\nrendered game frames using generative adversarial networks. To this end, we\npropose Real-time photorealism Enhancement in Games via a dual-stage gEnerative\nNetwork framework (REGEN), which employs a robust unpaired image-to-image\ntranslation model to produce semantically consistent photorealistic frames that\ntransform the problem into a simpler paired image-to-image translation task.\nThis enables training with a lightweight method that can achieve real-time\ninference time without compromising visual quality. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our framework on Grand Theft Auto V, showing that the approach\nachieves visual results comparable to the ones produced by the robust unpaired\nIm2Im method while improving inference speed by 32.14 times. Our findings also\nindicate that the results outperform the photorealism-enhanced frames produced\nby directly training a lightweight unpaired Im2Im translation method to\ntranslate the video game frames towards the visual characteristics of\nreal-world images.

Existing 3D HPE approaches often use the cropped\nimage alone as input for their models. However, the relative depths of joints\ncannot be accurately estimated from cropped images without the corresponding\ncamera intrinsics, which determine the perspective relationship between 3D\nobjects and the cropped images. In this work, we introduce Perspective Encoding\n(PE) to encode the camera intrinsics of the cropped images. Moreover, since the\nhuman subject can appear anywhere within the original image, the perspective\nrelationship between the 3D scene and the cropped image differs significantly,\nwhich complicates model fitting. Additionally, the further the human subject\ndeviates from the image center, the greater the perspective distortions in the\ncropped image. To address these issues, we propose Perspective Rotation (PR), a\ntransformation applied to the original image that centers the human subject,\nthereby reducing perspective distortions and alleviating the difficulty of\nmodel fitting. By incorporating PE and PR, we propose a novel 3D HPE framework,\nPersPose.

Although existing methods show strong forensic ability,\nthey rely on an idealized assumption of single watermark embedding, which\nproves impractical in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we formally define\nand demonstrate the existence of Multi-Embedding Attacks (MEA) for the first\ntime. When a previously protected image undergoes additional rounds of\nwatermark embedding, the original forensic watermark can be destroyed or\nremoved, rendering the entire proactive forensic mechanism ineffective.

This paper introduces the Event-Contextualized Video Transformer\n(ECVT), a novel architecture that leverages the advanced semantic understanding\ncapabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to bridge this gap. ECVT\nemploys a dual-branch design, comprising a Video Encoding Branch for\nspatio-temporal feature extraction and a Cross-Modal Guidance Branch. The\nlatter utilizes an LVLM to generate multi-granularity semantic descriptions,\nincluding Global Event Prompting for macro-level narrative and Temporal\nSub-event Prompting for fine-grained action details. These multi-level textual\ncues are integrated into the video encoder's learning process through\nsophisticated mechanisms such as adaptive gating for high-level semantic\nfusion, cross-modal attention for fine-grained feature refinement, and an event\ngraph module for temporal context calibration. Trained end-to-end with a\ncomprehensive loss function incorporating semantic consistency and temporal\ncalibration terms, ECVT significantly enhances the model's ability to\nunderstand video temporal structures and event logic. Extensive experiments on\nActivityNet v1.3 and THUMOS14 datasets demonstrate that ECVT achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance, with an average mAP of 40.5% on ActivityNet v1.3\nand mAP@0.5 of 67.1% on THUMOS14, outperforming leading baselines."}

While existing methods\nsupport direct dance synthesis, they fail to recognize that enabling users to\nedit dance movements is far more practical in real-world choreography\nscenarios. Moreover, the lack of high-quality dance datasets incorporating\niterative editing also limits addressing this challenge. To achieve this goal,\nwe first construct DanceRemix, a large-scale multi-turn editable dance dataset\ncomprising the prompt featuring over 25.3M dance frames and 84.5K pairs. In\naddition, we propose a novel framework for iterative and editable dance\ngeneration coherently aligned with given music signals, namely DanceEditor.\nConsidering the dance motion should be both musical rhythmic and enable\niterative editing by user descriptions, our framework is built upon a\nprediction-then-editing paradigm unifying multi-modal conditions. At the\ninitial prediction stage, our framework improves the authority of generated\nresults by directly modeling dance movements from tailored, aligned music.\nMoreover, at the subsequent iterative editing stages, we incorporate text\ndescriptions as conditioning information to draw the editable results through a\nspecifically designed Cross-modality Editing Module (CEM). Specifically, CEM\nadaptively integrates the initial prediction with music and text prompts as\ntemporal motion cues to guide the synthesized sequences. Thereby, the results\ndisplay music harmonics while preserving fine-grained semantic alignment with\ntext descriptions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method\noutperforms the state-of-the-art models on our newly collected DanceRemix\ndataset. Code is available at https://lzvsdy.github.io/DanceEditor/."}

Equipping these robots with manipulator arms unlocks\nthe advanced capability of loco-manipulation to perform complex physical\ninteraction tasks in areas ranging from industrial automation to\nsearch-and-rescue missions. However, achieving precise and adaptable grasping\nin such dynamic scenarios remains a significant challenge, often hindered by\nthe need for extensive real-world calibration and pre-programmed grasp\nconfigurations. This paper introduces a deep learning framework designed to\nenhance the grasping capabilities of quadrupeds equipped with arms, focusing on\nimproved precision and adaptability. Our approach centers on a sim-to-real\nmethodology that minimizes reliance on physical data collection. We developed a\npipeline within the Genesis simulation environment to generate a synthetic\ndataset of grasp attempts on common objects. By simulating thousands of\ninteractions from various perspectives, we created pixel-wise annotated\ngrasp-quality maps to serve as the ground truth for our model. This dataset was\nused to train a custom CNN with a U-Net-like architecture that processes\nmulti-modal input from an onboard RGB and depth cameras, including RGB images,\ndepth maps, segmentation masks, and surface normal maps. The trained model\noutputs a grasp-quality heatmap to identify the optimal grasp point. We\nvalidated the complete framework on a four-legged robot. The system\nsuccessfully executed a full loco-manipulation task: autonomously navigating to\na target object, perceiving it with its sensors, predicting the optimal grasp\npose using our model, and performing a precise grasp.

Project page:\n  https://gaussian-world-model.github.io/", "summary": "Training robot policies within a learned world model is trending due to the\ninefficiency of real-world interactions. The established image-based world\nmodels and policies have shown prior success, but lack robust geometric\ninformation that requires consistent spatial and physical understanding of the\nthree-dimensional world, even pre-trained on internet-scale video sources. To\nthis end, we propose a novel branch of world model named Gaussian World Model\n(GWM) for robotic manipulation, which reconstructs the future state by\ninferring the propagation of Gaussian primitives under the effect of robot\nactions. At its core is a latent Diffusion Transformer (DiT) combined with a 3D\nvariational autoencoder, enabling fine-grained scene-level future state\nreconstruction with Gaussian Splatting. GWM can not only enhance the visual\nrepresentation for imitation learning agent by self-supervised future\nprediction training, but can serve as a neural simulator that supports\nmodel-based reinforcement learning. Both simulated and real-world experiments\ndepict that GWM can precisely predict future scenes conditioned on diverse\nrobot actions, and can be further utilized to train policies that outperform\nthe state-of-the-art by impressive margins, showcasing the initial data scaling\npotential of 3D world model."}

This lack of\nsimulation setup hinders the evaluation of event-driven approaches for robotic\nmanipulation and navigation tasks. This work presents an open-source,\nuser-friendly v2e robotics operating system (ROS) package for Gazebo simulation\nthat enables seamless event stream generation from RGB camera feeds.

However, existing surface reconstruction works struggle to recover\naccurate scene geometry when the input views are extremely sparse. To address\nthis issue, we propose MeshSplat, a generalizable sparse-view surface\nreconstruction framework via Gaussian Splatting. Our key idea is to leverage\n2DGS as a bridge, which connects novel view synthesis to learned geometric\npriors and then transfers these priors to achieve surface reconstruction.\nSpecifically, we incorporate a feed-forward network to predict per-view\npixel-aligned 2DGS, which enables the network to synthesize novel view images\nand thus eliminates the need for direct 3D ground-truth supervision. To improve\nthe accuracy of 2DGS position and orientation prediction, we propose a Weighted\nChamfer Distance Loss to regularize the depth maps, especially in overlapping\nareas of input views, and also a normal prediction network to align the\norientation of 2DGS with normal vectors predicted by a monocular normal\nestimator.

According to this observation, we present\na new dataset comprising fifteen thousand object-instruction-affordance\ntriplets. All scenes in the dataset are from an egocentric viewpoint, designed\nto approximate the perspective of a human-like robot. Furthermore, we\ninvestigate how to enable large multimodal models (LMMs) to serve as affordance\npredictors by implementing a ``search against verifiers'' pipeline. An LMM is\nasked to progressively predict affordances, with the output at each step being\nverified by itself during the iterative process, imitating a reasoning process.\nExperiments show that our method not only unlocks new instruction-oriented\naffordance prediction capabilities, but also achieves outstanding performance\nbroadly."}

While recent self-supervised learning\nmethods achieve promising results, they often fail to capture the\ncharacteristics of non-traversable regions. Moreover, most prior works\nconcentrate on a single modality, overlooking the complementary strengths\noffered by integrating heterogeneous sensory modalities for more robust\ntraversability estimation. To address these limitations, we propose a\nmultimodal self-supervised framework for traversability labeling and\nestimation. First, our annotation pipeline integrates footprint, LiDAR, and\ncamera data as prompts for a vision foundation model, generating traversability\nlabels that account for both semantic and geometric cues. Then, leveraging\nthese labels, we train a dual-stream network that jointly learns from different\nmodalities in a decoupled manner, enhancing its capacity to recognize diverse\ntraversability patterns. In addition, we incorporate sparse LiDAR-based\nsupervision to mitigate the noise introduced by pseudo labels. Finally,\nextensive experiments conducted across urban, off-road, and campus environments\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. The proposed automatic labeling\nmethod consistently achieves around 88% IoU across diverse datasets. Compared\nto existing self-supervised state-of-the-art methods, our multimodal\ntraversability estimation network yields consistently higher IoU, improving by\n1.6-3.5% on all evaluated datasets."}
