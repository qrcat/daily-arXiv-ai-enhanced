### [1] [Towards High-Precision Depth Sensing via Monocular-Aided iToF and RGB Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16579)
*Yansong Du,Yutong Deng,Yuting Zhou,Feiyu Jiao,Jian Song,Xun Guan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的iToF-RGB融合框架，通过几何校准和双编码器网络解决iToF深度感知的低分辨率、窄视场和结构失真问题，实现了深度超分辨率和视场扩展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 间接飞行时间(iToF)深度传感存在空间分辨率低、视场角有限以及在复杂场景中结构失真的固有限制，需要与RGB图像融合来提升性能。

Method: 首先通过精确几何校准将窄视场iToF深度图重投影到宽视场RGB坐标系，然后使用双编码器融合网络联合提取iToF深度和RGB图像的互补特征，并利用单目深度先验恢复精细结构细节和进行深度超分辨率。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在准确性、结构一致性和视觉质量方面显著优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: 该iToF-RGB融合框架通过跨模态结构线索和深度一致性约束，成功实现了增强的深度精度、改善的边缘锐度和无缝的视场扩展。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel iToF-RGB fusion framework designed to address the
inherent limitations of indirect Time-of-Flight (iToF) depth sensing, such as
low spatial resolution, limited field-of-view (FoV), and structural distortion
in complex scenes. The proposed method first reprojects the narrow-FoV iToF
depth map onto the wide-FoV RGB coordinate system through a precise geometric
calibration and alignment module, ensuring pixel-level correspondence between
modalities. A dual-encoder fusion network is then employed to jointly extract
complementary features from the reprojected iToF depth and RGB image, guided by
monocular depth priors to recover fine-grained structural details and perform
depth super-resolution. By integrating cross-modal structural cues and depth
consistency constraints, our approach achieves enhanced depth accuracy,
improved edge sharpness, and seamless FoV expansion. Extensive experiments on
both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy,
structural consistency, and visual quality.

*Anindya Mondal,Ayan Banerjee,Sauradip Nag,Josep Lladós,Xiatian Zhu,Anjan Dutta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CountLoop是一个无需训练的训练框架，通过迭代结构化反馈为扩散模型提供精确的实例控制，在复杂高密度场景中实现高达98%的计数准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在逼真图像合成方面取得显著进展，但在生成具有精确对象实例数量的场景时仍不可靠，特别是在复杂和高密度设置中。

Method: 采用训练免费框架，通过图像生成和多模态代理评估的交替过程，使用语言引导的规划器和评论器评估对象计数、空间布局和属性一致性，并引入实例驱动的注意力掩码和组合生成技术来改善对象分离。

Result: 在COCO Count、T2I CompBench和两个新的高实例基准测试中，CountLoop实现了高达98%的计数准确率，同时保持空间保真度和视觉质量，以0.97的分数优于基于布局和梯度引导的基线方法。

Conclusion: CountLoop通过迭代结构化反馈机制有效解决了扩散模型在精确实例控制方面的局限性，为复杂场景生成提供了可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown remarkable progress in photorealistic image
synthesis, yet they remain unreliable for generating scenes with a precise
number of object instances, particularly in complex and high-density settings.
We present CountLoop, a training-free framework that provides diffusion models
with accurate instance control through iterative structured feedback. The
approach alternates between image generation and multimodal agent evaluation,
where a language-guided planner and critic assess object counts, spatial
arrangements, and attribute consistency. This feedback is then used to refine
layouts and guide subsequent generations. To further improve separation between
objects, especially in occluded scenes, we introduce instance-driven attention
masking and compositional generation techniques. Experiments on COCO Count, T2I
CompBench, and two new high-instance benchmarks show that CountLoop achieves
counting accuracy of up to 98% while maintaining spatial fidelity and visual
quality, outperforming layout-based and gradient-guided baselines with a score
of 0.97.

### [3] [Do VLMs Have Bad Eyes? Diagnosing Compositional Failures via Mechanistic Interpretability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16652)
*Ashwath Vaithinathan Aravindan,Abha Jha,Mihir Kulkarni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究通过机制可解释性技术分析发现，CLIP视觉编码器中MLP层的神经元存在特征叠加现象，这直接阻碍了组合特征表示能力，导致视觉语言模型在组合泛化和对象绑定方面表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在图像描述和视觉问答等任务中表现出色，但在组合泛化和对象绑定方面存在明显不足，限制了其处理新颖对象属性组合的能力。本研究旨在探索这些失败的根本原因。

Method: 采用机制可解释性技术分析CLIP视觉编码器的MLP层，研究神经元特征表示的特性，特别是特征叠加现象对组合特征表示的影响。

Result: 研究发现CLIP视觉编码器MLP层中的单个神经元同时表示多个特征，这种"叠加"现象直接阻碍了组合特征表示能力，从而影响了组合推理和对象绑定性能。

Conclusion: 这项研究揭示了视觉语言模型组合失败机制的初步发现，为理解VLMs组合能力限制提供了重要见解，相关代码和结果已开源。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable performance in
integrating visual and textual information for tasks such as image captioning
and visual question answering. However, these models struggle with
compositional generalization and object binding, which limit their ability to
handle novel combinations of objects and their attributes. Our work explores
the root causes of these failures using mechanistic interpretability
techniques. We show evidence that individual neurons in the MLP layers of
CLIP's vision encoder represent multiple features, and this "superposition"
directly hinders its compositional feature representation which consequently
affects compositional reasoning and object binding capabilities. We hope this
study will serve as an initial step toward uncovering the mechanistic roots of
compositional failures in VLMs. The code and supporting results can be found

### [4] [MSNav: Zero-Shot Vision-and-Language Navigation with Dynamic Memory and LLM Spatial Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16654)
*Chenghao Liu,Zhimu Zhou,Jiachen Zhang,Minghao Zhang,Songfang Huang,Huiling Duan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MSNav是一个用于视觉语言导航的框架，通过集成记忆模块、空间模块和决策模块来解决现有方法的脆弱性问题，在R2R和REVERIE数据集上实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于单一大型语言模型的视觉语言导航方法存在空间推理能力差、跨模态接地弱、长时任务内存过载等关键脆弱性问题，需要系统性地解决这些问题。

Method: 提出MSNav框架，包含三个模块：1）记忆模块-动态地图内存，通过选择性节点剪枝处理内存过载；2）空间模块-空间推理和对象关系推断，提升终点识别能力；3）决策模块-基于LLM的路径规划执行稳健动作。还开发了I-O-S数据集并微调Qwen3-4B模型为Qwen-Spatial。

Result: 在Room-to-Room (R2R)和REVERIE数据集上的广泛实验表明，MSNav实现了最先进的性能，在成功率和路径长度加权成功率方面都有显著提升。Qwen-Spatial在I-O-S测试集上的对象列表提取性能优于领先的商业LLM，获得了更高的F1和NDCG分数。

Conclusion: MSNav通过将三个模块融合成协同架构，将脆弱的推理转变为稳健的集成智能，有效解决了视觉语言导航中的关键挑战，为复杂环境中的导航任务提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) requires an agent to interpret natural
language instructions and navigate complex environments. Current approaches
often adopt a "black-box" paradigm, where a single Large Language Model (LLM)
makes end-to-end decisions. However, it is plagued by critical vulnerabilities,
including poor spatial reasoning, weak cross-modal grounding, and memory
overload in long-horizon tasks. To systematically address these issues, we
propose Memory Spatial Navigation(MSNav), a framework that fuses three modules
into a synergistic architecture, which transforms fragile inference into a
robust, integrated intelligence. MSNav integrates three modules: Memory Module,
a dynamic map memory module that tackles memory overload through selective node
pruning, enhancing long-range exploration; Spatial Module, a module for spatial
reasoning and object relationship inference that improves endpoint recognition;
and Decision Module, a module using LLM-based path planning to execute robust
actions. Powering Spatial Module, we also introduce an Instruction-Object-Space
(I-O-S) dataset and fine-tune the Qwen3-4B model into Qwen-Spatial (Qwen-Sp),
which outperforms leading commercial LLMs in object list extraction, achieving
higher F1 and NDCG scores on the I-O-S test set. Extensive experiments on the
Room-to-Room (R2R) and REVERIE datasets demonstrate MSNav's state-of-the-art
performance with significant improvements in Success Rate (SR) and Success
weighted by Path Length (SPL).

Motivation: 土壤分类有助于改善土地管理、提高农业产量和解决环境问题，对农业、土木工程和自然资源管理等领域的发展至关重要

Method: 采用卷积神经网络构建智能模型，使用鲸鱼优化算法和粒子群优化算法选择CNN超参数，通过Accuracy和F1指标评估系统性能

Result: 提出的方法获得了高效的分类结果，两种群体智能算法在土壤类型多分类任务中表现出色

Conclusion: 结合CNN和群体智能优化算法能有效提升土壤图像分类性能，为土壤类型识别提供了有价值的解决方案

Abstract: Classifying soil images contributes to better land management, increased
agricultural output, and practical solutions for environmental issues. The
development of various disciplines, particularly agriculture, civil
engineering, and natural resource management, is aided by understanding of soil
quality since it helps with risk reduction, performance improvement, and sound
decision-making . Artificial intelligence has recently been used in a number of
different fields. In this study, an intelligent model was constructed using
Convolutional Neural Networks to classify soil kinds, and machine learning
algorithms were used to enhance the performance of soil classification . To
achieve better implementation and performance of the Convolutional Neural
Networks algorithm and obtain valuable results for the process of classifying
soil type images, swarm algorithms were employed to obtain the best performance
by choosing Hyper parameters for the Convolutional Neural Networks network
using the Whale optimization algorithm and the Particle swarm optimization
algorithm, and comparing the results of using the two algorithms in the process
of multiple classification of soil types. The Accuracy and F1 measures were
adopted to test the system, and the results of the proposed work were efficient

### [6] [QA-VLM: Providing human-interpretable quality assessment for wire-feed laser additive manufacturing parts with Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16661)
*Qiaojie Zheng,Jiucai Zhang,Joy Gockel,Michael B. Wakin,Craig Brice,Xiaoli Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出QA-VLM框架，利用视觉语言模型的注意力机制和推理能力，结合领域专业知识，为增材制造提供可解释的质量评估


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统增材制造质量评估依赖人工专家，现有机器学习方法缺乏可解释性，限制了在实际应用中的可信度和采用率

Method: 开发QA-VLM框架，整合视觉语言模型的注意力机制和推理能力，并从同行评审期刊文章中提炼应用特定知识

Result: 在24个激光线材直接能量沉积单珠样品上评估，相比现成VLM模型，在解释质量方面展现出更高的有效性和一致性

Conclusion: 该方法有潜力在增材制造应用中实现可信赖、可解释的质量评估

Abstract: Image-based quality assessment (QA) in additive manufacturing (AM) often
relies heavily on the expertise and constant attention of skilled human
operators. While machine learning and deep learning methods have been
introduced to assist in this task, they typically provide black-box outputs
without interpretable justifications, limiting their trust and adoption in
real-world settings. In this work, we introduce a novel QA-VLM framework that
leverages the attention mechanisms and reasoning capabilities of
vision-language models (VLMs), enriched with application-specific knowledge
distilled from peer-reviewed journal articles, to generate human-interpretable
quality assessments. Evaluated on 24 single-bead samples produced by laser wire
direct energy deposition (DED-LW), our framework demonstrates higher validity
and consistency in explanation quality than off-the-shelf VLMs. These results
highlight the potential of our approach to enable trustworthy, interpretable
quality assessment in AM applications.

### [7] [The Loupe: A Plug-and-Play Attention Module for Amplifying Discriminative Features in Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16663)
*Naren Sengodan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了The Loupe，一种轻量级即插即用的注意力模块，可插入预训练Transformer中，通过复合损失函数隐式引导模型关注最具区分性的物体部位，显著提升细粒度视觉分类性能并提供可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 细粒度视觉分类在生物多样性监测和医疗诊断等关键应用中至关重要，但现有Vision Transformer缺乏可解释性，难以在需要信任和验证的领域应用。

Method: 设计The Loupe注意力模块，插入预训练骨干网络（如Swin Transformer），使用复合损失函数进行端到端训练，无需部位级标注即可引导模型关注判别性特征。

Result: 在CUB-200-2011数据集上，Swin-Base模型的准确率从85.40%提升至88.06%，增益2.66%，注意力图能有效定位语义有意义的特征。

Conclusion: 简单的内在注意力机制可作为强大正则化器，显著提升性能的同时提供清晰的可视化解释，为理解和信任模型决策过程提供有价值工具。

Abstract: Fine-Grained Visual Classification (FGVC) is a critical and challenging area
within computer vision, demanding the identification of highly subtle,
localized visual cues. The importance of FGVC extends to critical applications
such as biodiversity monitoring and medical diagnostics, where precision is
paramount. While large-scale Vision Transformers have achieved state-of-the-art
performance, their decision-making processes often lack the interpretability
required for trust and verification in such domains. In this paper, we
introduce The Loupe, a novel, lightweight, and plug-and-play attention module
designed to be inserted into pre-trained backbones like the Swin Transformer.
The Loupe is trained end-to-end with a composite loss function that implicitly
guides the model to focus on the most discriminative object parts without
requiring explicit part-level annotations. Our unique contribution lies in
demonstrating that a simple, intrinsic attention mechanism can act as a
powerful regularizer, significantly boosting performance while simultaneously
providing clear visual explanations. Our experimental evaluation on the
challenging CUB-200-2011 dataset shows that The Loupe improves the accuracy of
a Swin-Base model from 85.40% to 88.06%, a significant gain of 2.66%.
Crucially, our qualitative analysis of the learned attention maps reveals that
The Loupe effectively localizes semantically meaningful features, providing a
valuable tool for understanding and trusting the model's decision-making
process.

### [8] [COVID19 Prediction Based On CT Scans Of Lungs Using DenseNet Architecture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16670)
*Deborup Sanyal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 使用卷积神经网络分析COVID-19患者的肺部CT扫描，预测感染严重程度，帮助医生判断是否需要插管治疗或面临死亡风险


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: COVID-19大流行导致全球医疗系统崩溃，呼吸系统衰竭是主要死因。通过AI分析CT扫描可以辅助医生快速判断病情严重程度，缓解医疗资源短缺问题

Method: 采用卷积神经网络(CNN)模型，基于患者COVID-19阳性检测后的肺部CT扫描数据进行训练和分析

Result: 模型能够在一个月内预测COVID-19感染的严重程度，区分预后良好和需要插管或可能导致死亡的病例

Conclusion: 基于CNN的CT扫描分析为COVID-19严重程度评估提供了有效的AI辅助工具，有助于优化医疗资源配置和临床决策

Abstract: COVID19 took the world by storm since December 2019. A highly infectious
communicable disease, COVID19 is caused by the SARSCoV2 virus. By March 2020,
the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID19 as a global pandemic. A
pandemic in the 21st century after almost 100 years was something the world was
not prepared for, which resulted in the deaths of around 1.6 million people
worldwide. The most common symptoms of COVID19 were associated with the
respiratory system and resembled a cold, flu, or pneumonia. After extensive
research, doctors and scientists concluded that the main reason for lives being
lost due to COVID19 was failure of the respiratory system. Patients were dying
gasping for breath. Top healthcare systems of the world were failing badly as
there was an acute shortage of hospital beds, oxygen cylinders, and
ventilators. Many were dying without receiving any treatment at all. The aim of
this project is to help doctors decide the severity of COVID19 by reading the
patient's Computed Tomography (CT) scans of the lungs. Computer models are less
prone to human error, and Machine Learning or Neural Network models tend to
give better accuracy as training improves over time. We have decided to use a
Convolutional Neural Network model. Given that a patient tests positive, our
model will analyze the severity of COVID19 infection within one month of the
positive test result. The severity of the infection may be promising or
unfavorable (if it leads to intubation or death), based entirely on the CT
scans in the dataset.

### [9] [MedRepBench: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Medical Report Interpretation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16674)
*Fangxin Shang,Yuan Xia,Dalu Yang,Yahui Wang,Binglin Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了MedRepBench基准测试，包含1900份中文医疗报告，用于评估视觉语言模型在结构化医疗报告理解方面的性能，并设计了客观和主观评估协议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗报告解释在医疗保健中至关重要，但目前缺乏标准化基准来评估结构化医疗报告理解的质量，特别是针对中文医疗报告。

Method: 构建包含1900份去标识化中文医疗报告的基准测试，支持端到端视觉语言模型评估和文本+LLM对比评估。采用客观评估（字段级召回率）和自动化主观评估（使用LLM作为评分代理）两种协议。

Result: 基于客观指标设计奖励函数并应用GRPO优化中等规模VLM，获得高达6%的召回率提升。发现OCR+LLM管道存在布局盲区和延迟问题。

Conclusion: MedRepBench为医疗报告理解提供了标准化评估框架，揭示了当前方法的局限性，并推动了向稳健、完全基于视觉的报告理解系统的进一步发展。

Abstract: Medical report interpretation plays a crucial role in healthcare, enabling
both patient-facing explanations and effective information flow across clinical
systems. While recent vision-language models (VLMs) and large language models
(LLMs) have demonstrated general document understanding capabilities, there
remains a lack of standardized benchmarks to assess structured interpretation
quality in medical reports. We introduce MedRepBench, a comprehensive benchmark
built from 1,900 de-identified real-world Chinese medical reports spanning
diverse departments, patient demographics, and acquisition formats. The
benchmark is designed primarily to evaluate end-to-end VLMs for structured
medical report understanding. To enable controlled comparisons, we also include
a text-only evaluation setting using high-quality OCR outputs combined with
LLMs, allowing us to estimate the upper-bound performance when character
recognition errors are minimized. Our evaluation framework supports two
complementary protocols: (1) an objective evaluation measuring field-level
recall of structured clinical items, and (2) an automated subjective evaluation
using a powerful LLM as a scoring agent to assess factuality, interpretability,
and reasoning quality. Based on the objective metric, we further design a
reward function and apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to improve
a mid-scale VLM, achieving up to 6% recall gain. We also observe that the
OCR+LLM pipeline, despite strong performance, suffers from layout-blindness and
latency issues, motivating further progress toward robust, fully vision-based
report understanding.

### [10] [Two-Stage Framework for Efficient UAV-Based Wildfire Video Analysis with Adaptive Compression and Fire Source Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16739)
*Yanbing Bai,Rui-Yang Ju,Lemeng Zhao,Junjie Hu,Jianchao Bi,Erick Mas,Shunichi Koshimura*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级的两阶段框架，用于无人机平台的实时野火监测和火源检测。第一阶段使用策略网络识别冗余视频片段，第二阶段使用改进的YOLOv8模型定位火源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于无人机计算资源有限，无法独立运行大型模型进行实时视频分析，需要开发轻量高效的解决方案。

Method: 两阶段框架：第一阶段使用策略网络和站点机制识别冗余视频片段；第二阶段使用改进的YOLOv8模型进行火源定位。

Result: 在FLAME、HMDB51和Fire & Smoke数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著降低计算成本，同时保持分类精度，检测精度更高且推理时间相近。

Conclusion: 该框架为无人机平台提供了有效的实时野火监测解决方案，在计算效率和检测精度之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have become increasingly important in
disaster emergency response by enabling real-time aerial video analysis. Due to
the limited computational resources available on UAVs, large models cannot be
run independently for real-time analysis. To overcome this challenge, we
propose a lightweight and efficient two-stage framework for real-time wildfire
monitoring and fire source detection on UAV platforms. Specifically, in Stage
1, we utilize a policy network to identify and discard redundant video clips
using frame compression techniques, thereby reducing computational costs. In
addition, we introduce a station point mechanism that leverages future frame
information within the sequential policy network to improve prediction
accuracy. In Stage 2, once the frame is classified as "fire", we employ the
improved YOLOv8 model to localize the fire source. We evaluate the Stage 1
method using the FLAME and HMDB51 datasets, and the Stage 2 method using the
Fire & Smoke dataset. Experimental results show that our method significantly
reduces computational costs while maintaining classification accuracy in Stage
1, and achieves higher detection accuracy with similar inference time in Stage
2 compared to baseline methods.

*Abdul Rehman Akbar,Usama Sajjad,Ziyu Su,Wencheng Li,Fei Xing,Jimmy Ruiz,Wei Chen,Muhammad Khalid Khan Niazi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CellEcoNet是一个基于空间感知深度学习的新框架，通过自然语言类比分析病理图像，将细胞视为单词、细胞邻域为短语、组织结构为句子，自动学习上下文依赖关系来预测肺癌复发风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前约70%的侵袭性肺腺癌患者在术后5年内复发，现有工具无法准确识别需要辅助治疗的患者，存在未满足的临床需求。

Method: 提出CellEcoNet框架，将整个切片图像建模为自然语言：细胞作为单词，细胞邻域作为短语，组织结构作为句子，自动学习上下文依赖的含义和空间相互作用。

Result: 在456个H&E染色切片数据集上，CellEcoNet达到AUC 77.8%和HR 9.54，显著优于IASLC分级系统、AJCC分期和最先进的计算方法，并在不同人群亚组中表现一致。

Conclusion: CellEcoNet不仅提供了优越的预后预测性能，还通过解码肿瘤微环境的细胞"语言"，揭示了细胞细微变化如何编码复发风险，代表了病理学分析的新范式转变。

Abstract: Despite surgical resection, ~70% of invasive lung adenocarcinoma (ILA)
patients recur within five years, and current tools fail to identify those
needing adjuvant therapy. To address this unmet clinical need, we introduce
CellEcoNet, a novel spatially aware deep learning framework that models whole
slide images (WSIs) through natural language analogy, defining a "language of
pathology," where cells act as words, cellular neighborhoods become phrases,
and tissue architecture forms sentences. CellEcoNet learns these
context-dependent meanings automatically, capturing how subtle variations and
spatial interactions derive recurrence risk. On a dataset of 456 H&E-stained
WSIs, CellEcoNet achieved superior predictive performance (AUC:77.8% HR:9.54),
outperforming IASLC grading system (AUC:71.4% HR:2.36), AJCC Stage (AUC:64.0%
HR:1.17) and state-of-the-art computational methods (AUCs:62.2-67.4%).
CellEcoNet demonstrated fairness and consistent performance across diverse
demographic and clinical subgroups. Beyond prognosis, CellEcoNet marks a
paradigm shift by decoding the tumor microenvironment's cellular "language" to
reveal how subtle cell variations encode recurrence risk.

### [12] [A Framework for Benchmarking Fairness-Utility Trade-offs in Text-to-Image Models via Pareto Frontiers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16752)
*Marco N. Bochernitsan,Rodrigo C. Barros,Lucas S. Kupssinskü*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种使用帕累托最优前沿评估文生图模型公平性和效用的方法，通过超参数优化实现公平性和视觉质量的平衡评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文生图模型的公平性评估主要依赖定性判断或有限比较，缺乏可重复的评估方法，难以同时评估公平性和效用。

Method: 使用帕累托最优前沿方法，通过超参数化去偏方法，在公平性（归一化香农熵）和效用（ClipScore）之间寻找最优平衡点。

Result: 评估了Stable Diffusion、Fair Diffusion、SDXL、DeCoDi和FLUX等模型，发现大多数默认超参数配置在公平性-效用空间中被支配，可以轻松找到更好的超参数。

Conclusion: 该方法为文生图模型提供了可重复的公平性和效用评估框架，能够识别出优于默认配置的超参数设置。

Abstract: Achieving fairness in text-to-image generation demands mitigating social
biases without compromising visual fidelity, a challenge critical to
responsible AI. Current fairness evaluation procedures for text-to-image models
rely on qualitative judgment or narrow comparisons, which limit the capacity to
assess both fairness and utility in these models and prevent reproducible
assessment of debiasing methods. Existing approaches typically employ ad-hoc,
human-centered visual inspections that are both error-prone and difficult to
replicate. We propose a method for evaluating fairness and utility in
text-to-image models using Pareto-optimal frontiers across hyperparametrization
of debiasing methods. Our method allows for comparison between distinct
text-to-image models, outlining all configurations that optimize fairness for a
given utility and vice-versa. To illustrate our evaluation method, we use
Normalized Shannon Entropy and ClipScore for fairness and utility evaluation,
respectively. We assess fairness and utility in Stable Diffusion, Fair
Diffusion, SDXL, DeCoDi, and FLUX text-to-image models. Our method shows that
most default hyperparameterizations of the text-to-image model are dominated
solutions in the fairness-utility space, and it is straightforward to find
better hyperparameters.

TL;DR: WebMMU是一个多语言基准测试，评估网站视觉问答、代码编辑和原型到代码生成三个核心Web任务，揭示当前多模态大语言模型在复杂推理、精确元素定位和功能性UI理解方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基准测试将这些Web任务分开处理，而WebMMU通过专家标注的真实Web数据统一评估模型在复杂多步推理、精确元素定位和功能性UI理解编码方面的能力。

Method: 构建包含三个核心Web任务的多语言基准测试：网站视觉问答、HTML/CSS/JavaScript代码编辑、原型到代码生成，使用专家标注的真实Web数据进行评估。

Result: 多模态大语言模型在基础信息提取方面表现良好，但在推理和定位、保持功能性的代码编辑、以及维护层次结构和支持多语言内容的设计到代码生成方面存在困难。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前多模态大语言模型的关键局限性，强调了改进多模态和跨语言推理能力的必要性，以构建能够自动化多样化Web开发任务的未来Web代理。

Abstract: We present WebMMU, a multilingual benchmark that evaluates three core web
tasks: (1) website visual question answering, (2) code editing involving
HTML/CSS/JavaScript, and (3) mockup-to-code generation. Unlike prior benchmarks
that treat these tasks separately, WebMMU unifies them using expert-annotated,
real-world web data to assess models' abilities in complex multi-step
reasoning, precise element grounding, and functional UI comprehension and
coding. Our evaluation shows that while multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) perform well on basic information extraction, they struggle with
reasoning and grounding, editing code to preserve functionality, and generating
design-to-code that maintains hierarchy and supports multilingual content.
These findings reveal key limitations in current MLLMs and underscore the need
for improved multimodal and cross-lingual reasoning to build future web agents
capable of automating diverse web development tasks.

Abstract: Achieving robust performance and fairness across diverse patient populations
remains a challenge in developing clinically deployable deep learning models
for diagnostic imaging. Synthetic data generation has emerged as a promising
strategy to address limitations in dataset scale and diversity. We introduce
RoentGen-v2, a text-to-image diffusion model for chest radiographs that enables
fine-grained control over both radiographic findings and patient demographic
attributes, including sex, age, and race/ethnicity. RoentGen-v2 is the first
model to generate clinically plausible images with demographic conditioning,
facilitating the creation of a large, demographically balanced synthetic
dataset comprising over 565,000 images. We use this large synthetic dataset to
evaluate optimal training pipelines for downstream disease classification
models. In contrast to prior work that combines real and synthetic data
naively, we propose an improved training strategy that leverages synthetic data
for supervised pretraining, followed by fine-tuning on real data. Through
extensive evaluation on over 137,000 chest radiographs from five institutions,
we demonstrate that synthetic pretraining consistently improves model
performance, generalization to out-of-distribution settings, and fairness
across demographic subgroups. Across datasets, synthetic pretraining led to a
6.5% accuracy increase in the performance of downstream classification models,
compared to a modest 2.7% increase when naively combining real and synthetic
data. We observe this performance improvement simultaneously with the reduction
of the underdiagnosis fairness gap by 19.3%. These results highlight the
potential of synthetic imaging to advance equitable and generalizable medical
deep learning under real-world data constraints. We open source our code,
trained models, and synthetic dataset at

Motivation: 现有3D物体检测方法受限于闭集假设，难以识别现实场景中的新物体及其属性，需要开发能够处理开放词汇检测的解决方案。

Method: 使用基础模型连接3D特征与文本语义，采用特征拼接、提示调优策略、视角指定提示和水平翻转增强等技术，联合检测物体属性和空间关系等。

Result: 在nuScenes和Argoverse 2数据集上，OVODA在无需新类别锚点尺寸的情况下，在开放词汇3D物体检测方面优于最先进方法，并成功识别物体属性。

Conclusion: OVODA框架有效解决了开放词汇3D检测问题，同时发布了包含全面属性标注的OVAD数据集，为相关研究提供了重要资源。

Abstract: 3D object detection plays a crucial role in autonomous systems, yet existing
methods are limited by closed-set assumptions and struggle to recognize novel
objects and their attributes in real-world scenarios. We propose OVODA, a novel
framework enabling both open-vocabulary 3D object and attribute detection with
no need to know the novel class anchor size. OVODA uses foundation models to
bridge the semantic gap between 3D features and texts while jointly detecting
attributes, e.g., spatial relationships, motion states, etc. To facilitate such
research direction, we propose OVAD, a new dataset that supplements existing 3D
object detection benchmarks with comprehensive attribute annotations. OVODA
incorporates several key innovations, including foundation model feature
concatenation, prompt tuning strategies, and specialized techniques for
attribute detection, including perspective-specified prompts and horizontal
flip augmentation. Our results on both the nuScenes and Argoverse 2 datasets
show that under the condition of no given anchor sizes of novel classes, OVODA
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in open-vocabulary 3D object detection
while successfully recognizing object attributes. Our OVAD dataset is released
here: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16904069 .

Conclusion: 该网络能显著提升大规模天文巡天中超新星检测的准确性和效率，为天文图像处理提供了更有效的解决方案

Abstract: We introduce a transformer-based neural network for the accurate
classification of real and bogus transient detections in astronomical images.
This network advances beyond the conventional convolutional neural network
(CNN) methods, widely used in image processing tasks, by adopting an
architecture better suited for detailed pixel-by-pixel comparison. The
architecture enables efficient analysis of search and template images only,
thus removing the necessity for computationally-expensive difference imaging,
while maintaining high performance. Our primary evaluation was conducted using
the autoScan dataset from the Dark Energy Survey (DES), where the network
achieved a classification accuracy of 97.4% and diminishing performance utility
for difference image as the size of the training set grew. Further experiments
with DES data confirmed that the network can operate at a similar level even
when the input images are not centered on the supernova candidate. These
findings highlight the network's effectiveness in enhancing both accuracy and
efficiency of supernova detection in large-scale astronomical surveys.

TL;DR: NinA使用归一化流替代扩散模型作为VLA的动作解码器，实现单次采样，大幅提升推理速度同时保持性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型作为动作解码器需要多次迭代去噪步骤，限制了在需要高频控制的真实场景中的实用性

Method: 用归一化流(NF)替换扩散动作解码器，通过可逆变换实现单次采样，集成到FLOWER VLA架构并在LIBERO基准上微调

Result: NinA在相同训练机制下与基于扩散的解码器性能相当，但推理速度显著更快

Conclusion: NinA为高效、高频的VLA控制提供了一条有前景的路径，且不牺牲性能

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have established a
two-component architecture, where a pre-trained Vision-Language Model (VLM)
encodes visual observations and task descriptions, and an action decoder maps
these representations to continuous actions. Diffusion models have been widely
adopted as action decoders due to their ability to model complex, multimodal
action distributions. However, they require multiple iterative denoising steps
at inference time or downstream techniques to speed up sampling, limiting their
practicality in real-world settings where high-frequency control is crucial. In
this work, we present NinA (Normalizing Flows in Action), a fast and expressive
alter- native to diffusion-based decoders for VLAs. NinA replaces the diffusion
action decoder with a Normalizing Flow (NF) that enables one-shot sampling
through an invertible transformation, significantly reducing inference time. We
integrate NinA into the FLOWER VLA architecture and fine-tune on the LIBERO
benchmark. Our experiments show that NinA matches the performance of its
diffusion-based counterpart under the same training regime, while achieving
substantially faster inference. These results suggest that NinA offers a
promising path toward efficient, high-frequency VLA control without
compromising performance.

Motivation: 6G时代需要大规模天线阵列和精确空间信道状态信息，传统信道建模方法在空间分辨率、效率和可扩展性方面面临挑战，现有辐射场方法存在几何不准确和昂贵监督的问题

Method: 采用两阶段训练：第一阶段使用平面高斯作为几何基元进行密集表面对齐场景重建；第二阶段结合全结构无线电辐射和定制多视图损失准确建模无线电传播行为

Result: 相比现有辐射场方法，RF-PGS显著提高重建精度，降低训练成本，实现无线信道的高效表示

Conclusion: RF-PGS为可扩展的6G空间CSI建模提供了实用解决方案

Abstract: In the 6G era, the demand for higher system throughput and the implementation
of emerging 6G technologies require large-scale antenna arrays and accurate
spatial channel state information (Spatial-CSI). Traditional channel modeling
approaches, such as empirical models, ray tracing, and measurement-based
methods, face challenges in spatial resolution, efficiency, and scalability.
Radiance field-based methods have emerged as promising alternatives but still
suffer from geometric inaccuracy and costly supervision. This paper proposes
RF-PGS, a novel framework that reconstructs high-fidelity radio propagation
paths from only sparse path loss spectra. By introducing Planar Gaussians as
geometry primitives with certain RF-specific optimizations, RF-PGS achieves
dense, surface-aligned scene reconstruction in the first geometry training
stage. In the subsequent Radio Frequency (RF) training stage, the proposed
fully-structured radio radiance, combined with a tailored multi-view loss,
accurately models radio propagation behavior. Compared to prior radiance field
methods, RF-PGS significantly improves reconstruction accuracy, reduces
training costs, and enables efficient representation of wireless channels,
offering a practical solution for scalable 6G Spatial-CSI modeling.

TL;DR: GPO是一种新颖的可变形视网膜图像配准框架，通过高斯基元优化和结构化消息传递，解决了视网膜图像中大面积同质区域和稀疏血管特征导致的梯度信号有限问题，显著提高了配准精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视网膜图像配准面临重大挑战，因为大面积同质区域和稀疏但关键的血管特征导致标准学习框架中的梯度信号有限，难以实现精确的变形配准。

Method: 提出高斯基元优化(GPO)框架：1）初始粗配准后提取关键点作为描述符控制节点；2）每个节点建模为具有可训练位置、位移和半径的高斯基元；3）使用KNN高斯插值从信息丰富节点传播位移信号；4）通过多损失项进行端到端优化，确保关键点一致性和强度对齐。

Result: 在FIRE数据集上的实验表明，GPO将目标配准误差从6.2像素降低到约2.4像素，并将25像素处的AUC从0.770提高到0.938，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GPO框架通过在高梯度区域战略性地锚定节点，确保稳健的梯度流动，有效解决了纹理缺失区域的梯度消失问题，为视网膜图像配准提供了新的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Deformable retinal image registration is notoriously difficult due to large
homogeneous regions and sparse but critical vascular features, which cause
limited gradient signals in standard learning-based frameworks. In this paper,
we introduce Gaussian Primitive Optimization (GPO), a novel iterative framework
that performs structured message passing to overcome these challenges. After an
initial coarse alignment, we extract keypoints at salient anatomical structures
(e.g., major vessels) to serve as a minimal set of descriptor-based control
nodes (DCN). Each node is modelled as a Gaussian primitive with trainable
position, displacement, and radius, thus adapting its spatial influence to
local deformation scales. A K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Gaussian interpolation
then blends and propagates displacement signals from these information-rich
nodes to construct a globally coherent displacement field; focusing
interpolation on the top (K) neighbors reduces computational overhead while
preserving local detail. By strategically anchoring nodes in high-gradient
regions, GPO ensures robust gradient flow, mitigating vanishing gradient signal
in textureless areas. The framework is optimized end-to-end via a multi-term
loss that enforces both keypoint consistency and intensity alignment.
Experiments on the FIRE dataset show that GPO reduces the target registration
error from 6.2\,px to ~2.4\,px and increases the AUC at 25\,px from 0.770 to
0.938, substantially outperforming existing methods. The source code can be

Conclusion: 该研究填补了多模态情感推理领域的空白，为提升人机交互的情感理解能力提供了新的基准和方法框架。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have been widely applied across
various fields due to their powerful perceptual and reasoning capabilities. In
the realm of psychology, these models hold promise for a deeper understanding
of human emotions and behaviors. However, recent research primarily focuses on
enhancing their emotion recognition abilities, leaving the substantial
potential in emotion reasoning, which is crucial for improving the naturalness
and effectiveness of human-machine interactions. Therefore, in this paper, we
introduce a multi-turn multimodal emotion understanding and reasoning (MTMEUR)
benchmark, which encompasses 1,451 video data from real-life scenarios, along
with 5,101 progressive questions. These questions cover various aspects,
including emotion recognition, potential causes of emotions, future action
prediction, etc. Besides, we propose a multi-agent framework, where each agent
specializes in a specific aspect, such as background context, character
dynamics, and event details, to improve the system's reasoning capabilities.
Furthermore, we conduct experiments with existing MLLMs and our agent-based
method on the proposed benchmark, revealing that most models face significant
challenges with this task.

Motivation: 个性化文本到图像模型如DreamBooth需要微调大规模扩散模型，导致存储大量特定主体模型时产生显著存储开销

Method: 利用权重增量的低秩特性，应用奇异值分解(SVD)分解权重增量，采用基于能量的秩截断策略平衡压缩效率和重建保真度

Result: 在多主体数据集上实现显著压缩，CLIP分数、SSIM和FID指标显示生成质量损失可忽略不计

Conclusion: 该方法实现了可扩展和高效的个性化扩散模型部署，是存储和部署大规模主体定制化的实用解决方案

Abstract: Personalized text-to-image models such as DreamBooth require fine-tuning
large-scale diffusion backbones, resulting in significant storage overhead when
maintaining many subject-specific models. We present Delta-SVD, a post-hoc,
training-free compression method that targets the parameter weights update
induced by DreamBooth fine-tuning. Our key observation is that these delta
weights exhibit strong low-rank structure due to the sparse and localized
nature of personalization. Delta-SVD first applies Singular Value Decomposition
(SVD) to factorize the weight deltas, followed by an energy-based rank
truncation strategy to balance compression efficiency and reconstruction
fidelity. The resulting compressed models are fully plug-and-play and can be
re-constructed on-the-fly during inference. Notably, the proposed approach is
simple, efficient, and preserves the original model architecture. Experiments
on a multiple subject dataset demonstrate that Delta-SVD achieves substantial
compression with negligible loss in generation quality measured by CLIP score,
SSIM and FID. Our method enables scalable and efficient deployment of
personalized diffusion models, making it a practical solution for real-world
applications that require storing and deploying large-scale subject
customizations.

Motivation: 理解视觉内容如何传达情感在社交媒体主导的时代至关重要，但情感感知与复杂的场景级语义紧密相关，这是一个具有挑战性的问题。

Method: 提出MLLMsent框架，从三个角度研究多模态大语言模型的情感推理能力：(1)直接用于图像情感分类；(2)关联预训练LLM分析自动生成的图像描述；(3)在情感标注图像描述上微调LLM。

Result: 在基准测试中，特别是微调方法，比Lexicon、CNN和Transformer基线分别高出30.9%、64.8%和42.4%。在跨数据集测试中，无需在新数据上训练，仍比最佳竞争对手高出8.26%。

Conclusion: 结果突显了所提视觉推理方案在推进情感计算方面的潜力，同时为未来研究建立了新的基准。

Abstract: Understanding how visual content communicates sentiment is critical in an era
where online interaction is increasingly dominated by this kind of media on
social platforms. However, this remains a challenging problem, as sentiment
perception is closely tied to complex, scene-level semantics. In this paper, we
propose an original framework, MLLMsent, to investigate the sentiment reasoning
capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) through three
perspectives: (1) using those MLLMs for direct sentiment classification from
images; (2) associating them with pre-trained LLMs for sentiment analysis on
automatically generated image descriptions; and (3) fine-tuning the LLMs on
sentiment-labeled image descriptions. Experiments on a recent and established
benchmark demonstrate that our proposal, particularly the fine-tuned approach,
achieves state-of-the-art results outperforming Lexicon-, CNN-, and
Transformer-based baselines by up to 30.9%, 64.8%, and 42.4%, respectively,
across different levels of evaluators' agreement and sentiment polarity
categories. Remarkably, in a cross-dataset test, without any training on these
new data, our model still outperforms, by up to 8.26%, the best runner-up,
which has been trained directly on them. These results highlight the potential
of the proposed visual reasoning scheme for advancing affective computing,
while also establishing new benchmarks for future research.

Motivation: 现有研究在恶劣天气下的多模态图像融合中，虽然尝试引入文本信息来改善语义感知，但缺乏有效的文本内容分类和深入分析，需要更有效的方法来处理天气退化问题。

Method: 提出AWM-Fuse方法，包含全局特征感知模块（使用BLIP生成字幕提取整体场景特征和主要退化类型）和局部模块（使用ChatGPT生成详细场景描述关注具体退化效果），通过文本描述约束融合图像生成。

Result: 大量实验表明，AWM-Fuse在复杂天气条件和下游任务中优于当前最先进的方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过文本引导的网络学习过程，有效促进了更有意义的视觉特征学习，在恶劣天气条件下提供了更清晰的场景表示。

Abstract: Multi-modality image fusion (MMIF) in adverse weather aims to address the
loss of visual information caused by weather-related degradations, providing
clearer scene representations. Although less studies have attempted to
incorporate textual information to improve semantic perception, they often lack
effective categorization and thorough analysis of textual content. In response,
we propose AWM-Fuse, a novel fusion method for adverse weather conditions,
designed to handle multiple degradations through global and local text
perception within a unified, shared weight architecture. In particular, a
global feature perception module leverages BLIP-produced captions to extract
overall scene features and identify primary degradation types, thus promoting
generalization across various adverse weather conditions. Complementing this,
the local module employs detailed scene descriptions produced by ChatGPT to
concentrate on specific degradation effects through concrete textual cues,
thereby capturing finer details. Furthermore, textual descriptions are used to
constrain the generation of fusion images, effectively steering the network
learning process toward better alignment with real semantic labels, thereby
promoting the learning of more meaningful visual features. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that AWM-Fuse outperforms current state-of-the-art
methods in complex weather conditions and downstream tasks. Our code is

Conclusion: SAEViT为各种基础视觉任务提供了一个轻量级解决方案，在计算效率和性能之间取得了良好平衡

Abstract: Vision Transformer (ViT) has prevailed in computer vision tasks due to its
strong long-range dependency modelling ability. However, its large model size
with high computational cost and weak local feature modeling ability hinder its
application in real scenarios. To balance computation efficiency and
performance, we propose SAEViT (Sparse-Attention-Efficient-ViT), a lightweight
ViT based model with convolution blocks, in this paper to achieve efficient
downstream vision tasks. Specifically, SAEViT introduces a Sparsely Aggregated
Attention (SAA) module that performs adaptive sparse sampling based on image
redundancy and recovers the feature map via deconvolution operation, which
significantly reduces the computational complexity of attention operations. In
addition, a Channel-Interactive Feed-Forward Network (CIFFN) layer is developed
to enhance inter-channel information exchange through feature decomposition and
redistribution, mitigating redundancy in traditional feed-forward networks
(FNN). Finally, a hierarchical pyramid structure with embedded depth-wise
separable convolutional blocks (DWSConv) is devised to further strengthen
convolutional features. Extensive experiments on mainstream datasets show that
SAEViT achieves Top-1 accuracies of 76.3\% and 79.6\% on the ImageNet-1K
classification task with only 0.8 GFLOPs and 1.3 GFLOPs, respectively,
demonstrating a lightweight solution for various fundamental vision tasks.

Result: MDIQA在图像质量评估方面表现优异，并能灵活应用于图像修复任务以适应不同用户偏好

Conclusion: 多维图像质量评估框架能更好地模拟人类视觉感知，为图像修复提供更灵活的质量控制手段

Abstract: Recent advancements in image quality assessment (IQA), driven by
sophisticated deep neural network designs, have significantly improved the
ability to approach human perceptions. However, most existing methods are
obsessed with fitting the overall score, neglecting the fact that humans
typically evaluate image quality from different dimensions before arriving at
an overall quality assessment. To overcome this problem, we propose a
multi-dimensional image quality assessment (MDIQA) framework. Specifically, we
model image quality across various perceptual dimensions, including five
technical and four aesthetic dimensions, to capture the multifaceted nature of
human visual perception within distinct branches. Each branch of our MDIQA is
initially trained under the guidance of a separate dimension, and the
respective features are then amalgamated to generate the final IQA score.
Additionally, when the MDIQA model is ready, we can deploy it for a flexible
training of image restoration (IR) models, enabling the restoration results to
better align with varying user preferences through the adjustment of perceptual
dimension weights. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our MDIQA achieves
superior performance and can be effectively and flexibly applied to image
restoration tasks. The code is available: https://github.com/YaoShunyu19/MDIQA.

Method: 提出结构能量引导采样(SEGS)，在中间U-Net特征的PCA子空间中定义结构能量，并将其梯度注入去噪轨迹，在采样时强制多视角一致性。

Result: SEGS显著减少了Janus伪影，实现了更好的几何对齐和视角一致性，无需重新训练或修改权重。

Conclusion: SEGS是一个有效的训练免费解决方案，能够无缝集成到现有SDS/VSD流程中，成功解决了文本到3D生成中的视角一致性问题。

Abstract: Text-to-3D generation often suffers from the Janus problem, where objects
look correct from the front but collapse into duplicated or distorted geometry
from other angles. We attribute this failure to viewpoint bias in 2D diffusion
priors, which propagates into 3D optimization. To address this, we propose
Structural Energy-Guided Sampling (SEGS), a training-free, plug-and-play
framework that enforces multi-view consistency entirely at sampling time. SEGS
defines a structural energy in a PCA subspace of intermediate U-Net features
and injects its gradients into the denoising trajectory, steering geometry
toward the intended viewpoint while preserving appearance fidelity. Integrated
seamlessly into SDS/VSD pipelines, SEGS significantly reduces Janus artifacts,
achieving improved geometric alignment and viewpoint consistency without
retraining or weight modification.

*Yudong Hu,Yueju Han,Rui Sun,Jinke Ren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MSPCaps是一个新颖的多尺度胶囊网络架构，通过多尺度特征提取、统一补丁化胶囊层和交叉一致性路由机制，有效解决了传统胶囊网络忽略多尺度信息和特征融合困难的问题，在分类准确率和模型效率方面均表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有胶囊网络通常依赖单一高层特征图，忽略了多尺度特征的丰富互补信息，且传统特征融合策略难以协调多尺度特征差异，导致分类性能不佳。

Method: 提出MSPCaps架构，包含三个核心组件：多尺度ResNet骨干网络(MSRB)提取多尺度特征；补丁化胶囊层(PatchifyCaps)将多尺度特征统一分割成主胶囊；交叉一致性路由(CAR)块通过识别最大一致性的跨尺度预测对来自适应路由多尺度胶囊。

Result: MSPCaps展现出卓越的可扩展性和鲁棒性，在分类准确率方面持续超越多个基线方法，模型配置从高效的Tiny模型(344.3K参数)到强大的Large模型(10.9M参数)均有优异表现。

Conclusion: MSPCaps通过有效整合多尺度特征学习和高效胶囊路由，在特征表示学习方面具有重要推进潜力，为视觉识别任务提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Capsule Network (CapsNet) has demonstrated significant potential in visual
recognition by capturing spatial relationships and part-whole hierarchies for
learning equivariant feature representations. However, existing CapsNet and
variants often rely on a single high-level feature map, overlooking the rich
complementary information from multi-scale features. Furthermore, conventional
feature fusion strategies (e.g., addition and concatenation) struggle to
reconcile multi-scale feature discrepancies, leading to suboptimal
classification performance. To address these limitations, we propose the
Multi-Scale Patchify Capsule Network (MSPCaps), a novel architecture that
integrates multi-scale feature learning and efficient capsule routing.
Specifically, MSPCaps consists of three key components: a Multi-Scale ResNet
Backbone (MSRB), a Patchify Capsule Layer (PatchifyCaps), and Cross-Agreement
Routing (CAR) blocks. First, the MSRB extracts diverse multi-scale feature
representations from input images, preserving both fine-grained details and
global contextual information. Second, the PatchifyCaps partitions these
multi-scale features into primary capsules using a uniform patch size,
equipping the model with the ability to learn from diverse receptive fields.
Finally, the CAR block adaptively routes the multi-scale capsules by
identifying cross-scale prediction pairs with maximum agreement. Unlike the
simple concatenation of multiple self-routing blocks, CAR ensures that only the
most coherent capsules contribute to the final voting. Our proposed MSPCaps
achieves remarkable scalability and superior robustness, consistently
surpassing multiple baseline methods in terms of classification accuracy, with
configurations ranging from a highly efficient Tiny model (344.3K parameters)
to a powerful Large model (10.9M parameters), highlighting its potential in
advancing feature representation learning.

TL;DR: CC-CMR是一种基于对比学习和跨模态对齐的框架，用于无钆对比剂的心肌病筛查，通过将电影CMR与晚期钆增强序列的潜在空间对齐，在电影CMR嵌入中编码纤维化特异性病理信息


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心脏磁共振(CMR)是心肌病诊断的金标准，但依赖钆对比剂和人工密集解读限制了其在人群规模筛查中的应用，需要开发无钆的准确筛查方法

Method: 提出对比学习和跨模态对齐框架，通过特征交互模块同时优化诊断精度和跨模态特征一致性，采用不确定性引导的自适应训练机制动态校准任务特定目标

Result: 在多中心231名受试者数据上，CC-CMR达到0.943的准确率(95% CI: 0.886-0.986)，比最先进的仅电影CMR模型提升4.3%，同时消除了钆依赖性

Conclusion: CC-CMR展示了在广泛人群和医疗环境中进行无钆心肌病筛查的临床可行性，为大规模部署提供了可行解决方案

Abstract: Cardiomyopathy, a principal contributor to heart failure and sudden cardiac
mortality, demands precise early screening. Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR),
recognized as the diagnostic 'gold standard' through multiparametric protocols,
holds the potential to serve as an accurate screening tool. However, its
reliance on gadolinium contrast and labor-intensive interpretation hinders
population-scale deployment. We propose CC-CMR, a Contrastive Learning and
Cross-Modal alignment framework for gadolinium-free cardiomyopathy screening
using cine CMR sequences. By aligning the latent spaces of cine CMR and Late
Gadolinium Enhancement (LGE) sequences, our model encodes fibrosis-specific
pathology into cine CMR embeddings. A Feature Interaction Module concurrently
optimizes diagnostic precision and cross-modal feature congruence, augmented by
an uncertainty-guided adaptive training mechanism that dynamically calibrates
task-specific objectives to ensure model generalizability. Evaluated on
multi-center data from 231 subjects, CC-CMR achieves accuracy of 0.943 (95% CI:
0.886-0.986), outperforming state-of-the-art cine-CMR-only models by 4.3% while
eliminating gadolinium dependency, demonstrating its clinical viability for
wide range of populations and healthcare environments.

*Qi Song,Ziyuan Luo,Ka Chun Cheung,Simon See,Renjie Wan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Invert3D是一个新颖的3D内容个性化框架，通过建立3D表示与文本嵌入空间的对齐，实现无需重新训练的自然语言驱动的3D内容个性化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3D个性化方法主要依赖基于知识蒸馏的方法，需要计算昂贵的重新训练过程，而视觉语言模型虽然能直接对图像进行个性化，但由于3D内容与2D图像的结构差异，无法直接应用于3D个性化。

Method: 开发相机条件的3D到文本逆向机制，将3D内容投影到与文本嵌入对齐的3D嵌入空间中，建立3D表示与文本嵌入空间的对齐。

Result: 广泛的实验表明，Invert3D能够有效实现3D内容的个性化。

Conclusion: Invert3D通过建立3D与文本嵌入的对齐，实现了高效便捷的3D内容个性化，消除了计算昂贵的重新训练需求。

Abstract: Recent advances in NeRF and 3DGS have significantly enhanced the efficiency
and quality of 3D content synthesis. However, efficient personalization of
generated 3D content remains a critical challenge. Current 3D personalization
approaches predominantly rely on knowledge distillation-based methods, which
require computationally expensive retraining procedures. To address this
challenge, we propose \textbf{Invert3D}, a novel framework for convenient 3D
content personalization. Nowadays, vision-language models such as CLIP enable
direct image personalization through aligned vision-text embedding spaces.
However, the inherent structural differences between 3D content and 2D images
preclude direct application of these techniques to 3D personalization. Our
approach bridges this gap by establishing alignment between 3D representations
and text embedding spaces. Specifically, we develop a camera-conditioned
3D-to-text inverse mechanism that projects 3D contents into a 3D embedding
aligned with text embeddings. This alignment enables efficient manipulation and
personalization of 3D content through natural language prompts, eliminating the
need for computationally retraining procedures. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Invert3D achieves effective personalization of 3D content. Our

*Krishna Kanth Nakka,Alexandre Alahi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NAT方法通过针对神经网络中的特定神经元进行攻击，而不是传统的嵌入层分离，显著提高了对抗性扰动的可迁移性，在跨模型和跨域设置中分别超过现有基线14%和4%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常在源模型的单个中间层最大化干净图像和对抗图像的嵌入分离，但这种方法往往过度关注少数代表相似概念的神经元，而忽略层内其他神经元。

Method: 提出Neuron Attack for Transferability (NAT)方法，从嵌入层分离转向更基础的神经元特定方法，通过针对单个神经元来破坏神经网络的核心单元。

Result: 在41个不同的ImageNet模型和9个细粒度模型上进行广泛实验，NAT在跨模型设置中超过现有基线14%以上，在跨域设置中超过4%。通过利用训练生成器的互补攻击能力，仅用10次查询就实现了令人印象深刻的欺骗率。

Conclusion: 针对特定神经元的方法为跨不同模型的可迁移性提供了共同基础，比传统的层级优化方法更有效。

Abstract: The generation of transferable adversarial perturbations typically involves
training a generator to maximize embedding separation between clean and
adversarial images at a single mid-layer of a source model. In this work, we
build on this approach and introduce Neuron Attack for Transferability (NAT), a
method designed to target specific neuron within the embedding. Our approach is
motivated by the observation that previous layer-level optimizations often
disproportionately focus on a few neurons representing similar concepts,
leaving other neurons within the attacked layer minimally affected. NAT shifts
the focus from embedding-level separation to a more fundamental,
neuron-specific approach. We find that targeting individual neurons effectively
disrupts the core units of the neural network, providing a common basis for
transferability across different models. Through extensive experiments on 41
diverse ImageNet models and 9 fine-grained models, NAT achieves fooling rates
that surpass existing baselines by over 14\% in cross-model and 4\% in
cross-domain settings. Furthermore, by leveraging the complementary attacking
capabilities of the trained generators, we achieve impressive fooling rates
within just 10 queries. Our code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常只提供最终评分而缺乏解释性分析，限制了在体育、医疗和机器人等领域的实际应用，需要能够提供详细反馈的动作评估系统。

Method: 采用两步法：1) 逐步动作推理 - 专门设计的思维链过程，从整体识别到子动作分析再到最终评分；2) 分层策略学习 - 强化学习策略，学习细粒度子动作动态并与高级动作质量对齐。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上表现出优越性能，证明了该方法能够提供准确且可解释的动作评估。

Conclusion: HieroAction通过结合逐步推理和分层学习，成功实现了准确、结构化且可解释的人类动作评估，解决了现有方法缺乏解释性的问题。

Abstract: Evaluating human actions with clear and detailed feedback is important in
areas such as sports, healthcare, and robotics, where decisions rely not only
on final outcomes but also on interpretable reasoning. However, most existing
methods provide only a final score without explanation or detailed analysis,
limiting their practical applicability. To address this, we introduce
HieroAction, a vision-language model that delivers accurate and structured
assessments of human actions. HieroAction builds on two key ideas: (1) Stepwise
Action Reasoning, a tailored chain of thought process designed specifically for
action assessment, which guides the model to evaluate actions step by step,
from overall recognition through sub action analysis to final scoring, thus
enhancing interpretability and structured understanding; and (2) Hierarchical
Policy Learning, a reinforcement learning strategy that enables the model to
learn fine grained sub action dynamics and align them with high level action
quality, thereby improving scoring precision. The reasoning pathway structures
the evaluation process, while policy learning refines each stage through reward
based optimization. Their integration ensures accurate and interpretable
assessments, as demonstrated by superior performance across multiple benchmark
datasets. Code will be released upon acceptance.

Conclusion: RPD-Diff通过物理引导和区域自适应机制，有效解决了密集非均匀雾霾条件下的图像去雾挑战，为复杂雾霾场景下的能见度增强提供了鲁棒解决方案。

Abstract: Single-image dehazing under dense and non-uniform haze conditions remains
challenging due to severe information degradation and spatial heterogeneity.
Traditional diffusion-based dehazing methods struggle with insufficient
generation conditioning and lack of adaptability to spatially varying haze
distributions, which leads to suboptimal restoration. To address these
limitations, we propose RPD-Diff, a Region-adaptive Physics-guided Dehazing
Diffusion Model for robust visibility enhancement in complex haze scenarios.
RPD-Diff introduces a Physics-guided Intermediate State Targeting (PIST)
strategy, which leverages physical priors to reformulate the diffusion Markov
chain by generation target transitions, mitigating the issue of insufficient
conditioning in dense haze scenarios. Additionally, the Haze-Aware Denoising
Timestep Predictor (HADTP) dynamically adjusts patch-specific denoising
timesteps employing a transmission map cross-attention mechanism, adeptly
managing non-uniform haze distributions. Extensive experiments across four
real-world datasets demonstrate that RPD-Diff achieves state-of-the-art
performance in challenging dense and non-uniform haze scenarios, delivering
high-quality, haze-free images with superior detail clarity and color fidelity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的群体计数模型设计原则，强调模型的局部建模能力，并设计了LIMM模型，通过窗口划分和窗口对比学习策略显著提升了局部密度识别能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新思考群体计数的本质特征：人群中的个体（人头）通常只占图像的很小部分，这一特征在现有工作中未被重视。现有方法通常使用与其他视觉任务相同的骨干网络并追求大感受野，而本文强调局部建模能力的重要性。

Method: 提出LIMM模型，采用两种策略：1）窗口划分设计，将模型输入划分为网格窗口；2）窗口对比学习设计，增强模型区分局部密度水平的能力。最后使用全局注意力模块处理偶尔出现的大尺寸个体。

Result: 在多个公开数据集上的实验表明，该模型在局部建模能力上有显著提升（如在JHU-Crowd++高密度子集上MAE提升8.7%），同时不损害对大尺寸个体的计数能力，达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 强调局部建模能力是群体计数任务的关键设计原则，LIMM模型通过创新的窗口策略有效解决了局部密度识别问题，为群体计数研究提供了新的方向。

Abstract: The motivation of this paper originates from rethinking an essential
characteristic of crowd counting: individuals (heads of humans) in the crowd
counting task typically occupy a very small portion of the image. This
characteristic has never been the focus of existing works: they typically use
the same backbone as other visual tasks and pursue a large receptive field.
This drives us to propose a new model design principle of crowd counting:
emphasizing local modeling capability of the model. We follow the principle and
design a crowd counting model named Local Information Matters Model (LIMM). The
main innovation lies in two strategies: a window partitioning design that
applies grid windows to the model input, and a window-wise contrastive learning
design to enhance the model's ability to distinguish between local density
levels. Moreover, a global attention module is applied to the end of the model
to handle the occasionally occurring large-sized individuals. Extensive
experiments on multiple public datasets illustrate that the proposed model
shows a significant improvement in local modeling capability (8.7\% in MAE on
the JHU-Crowd++ high-density subset for example), without compromising its
ability to count large-sized ones, which achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Result: 实验表明，即使是GPT-4V等最先进的闭源模型在面对扰动输入时也表现出显著的性能下降（清洁准确率85.2% vs PRS 72.1%）。

Conclusion: RDR框架有效提升了多模态大语言模型在视觉退化科学图表上的鲁棒性，揭示了当前模型在真实世界视觉扰动下的脆弱性，为科学图表理解提供了新的评估和增强方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and their multimodal variants (LVLMs) hold
immense promise for scientific and engineering applications, particularly in
processing visual information like scientific diagrams. However, their
practical deployment is hindered by a critical lack of robustness to common
visual perturbations such as noise, blur, and occlusions, which are prevalent
in real-world scientific documents. Existing evaluation benchmarks largely
overlook this challenge, leaving the robust reasoning capabilities of LVLMs on
visually degraded scientific diagrams underexplored. To address this, we
introduce the Robust Diagram Reasoning (RDR) framework, a novel approach
designed to enhance and rigorously evaluate LVLMs' performance under such
conditions. At its core, RDR employs an Adaptive Multi-View & Consistency
Verification (AMCV) mechanism, which involves generating multiple perturbed
versions of a diagram, performing parallel inference, and then applying a
consistency-based self-correction loop. We also propose two new metrics,
Perturbation Robustness Score (PRS) and Visual Degradation Consistency (VDC),
to quantify robustness. Furthermore, we construct SciDiagram-Robust, the first
large-scale scientific diagram question-answering dataset specifically
augmented with diverse, programmatically generated visual perturbations. Our
extensive experiments demonstrate that even state-of-the-art closed-source
LVLMs like GPT-4V exhibit significant performance degradation when faced with
perturbed inputs (Clean Accuracy 85.2% vs. PRS 72.1%).

Result: 在年龄估计和深度估计等多个视觉回归任务上的大量实验表明，BSAM方法 consistently优于现有方法

Conclusion: BSAM通过平衡泛化能力有效解决了不平衡回归问题，为回归模型提供了理论泛化保证

Abstract: Regression is fundamental in computer vision and is widely used in various
tasks including age estimation, depth estimation, target localization, \etc
However, real-world data often exhibits imbalanced distribution, making
regression models perform poorly especially for target values with rare
observations~(known as the imbalanced regression problem). In this paper, we
reframe imbalanced regression as an imbalanced generalization problem. To
tackle that, we look into the loss sharpness property for measuring the
generalization ability of regression models in the observation space. Namely,
given a certain perturbation on the model parameters, we check how model
performance changes according to the loss values of different target
observations. We propose a simple yet effective approach called Balanced
Sharpness-Aware Minimization~(BSAM) to enforce the uniform generalization
ability of regression models for the entire observation space. In particular,
we start from the traditional sharpness-aware minimization and then introduce a
novel targeted reweighting strategy to homogenize the generalization ability
across the observation space, which guarantees a theoretical generalization
bound. Extensive experiments on multiple vision regression tasks, including age
and depth estimation, demonstrate that our BSAM method consistently outperforms
existing approaches. The code is available

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs) have
achieved remarkable progress in natural language processing and multimodal
understanding. Despite their impressive generalization capabilities, current
LVLMs often exhibit insufficient robustness, proneness to hallucination, and
reasoning errors in complex real-world scenarios, particularly when precise
image region localization and fine-grained visual reasoning are required. To
address these limitations, we propose the Hierarchical Contextual Grounding
LVLM (HCG-LVLM), a novel architecture that mimics human coarse-to-fine
cognitive processing. HCG-LVLM employs a two-layered approach: a Global
Contextual Perception layer for initial broad understanding and a Fine-grained
Local Grounding layer. The latter incorporates a Local Detail Enhancement
Module to extract high-resolution features and a Semantic Consistency Validator
to ensure accurate, hallucination-free visual-language alignment. Through an
adaptive fusion mechanism, information from both layers is integrated for
robust and precise outputs. Extensive experiments on challenging datasets,
including GQA, A-OKVQA for fine-grained VQA, and RefCOCO/+/g for Referring
Expression Comprehension, demonstrate that HCG-LVLM consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art models such as Flamingo, BLIP-2, and MiniGPT-4. Our model
achieves superior accuracy and significantly reduces hallucination, validating
the effectiveness of its hierarchical design in enhancing fine-grained
visual-language understanding and precise grounding capabilities.

Abstract: Domain generalization seeks to develop models trained on a limited set of
source domains that are capable of generalizing effectively to unseen target
domains. While the predominant approach leverages large-scale pre-trained
vision models as initialization, recent studies have highlighted that full
fine-tuning can compromise the intrinsic generalization capabilities of these
models. To address this limitation, parameter-efficient adaptation strategies
have emerged, wherein only a subset of model parameters is selectively
fine-tuned, thereby balancing task adaptation with the preservation of
generalization. Motivated by this paradigm, we introduce Joint Parameter
Selection (JPS), a novel method that restricts updates to a small, sparse
subset of parameters, thereby retaining and harnessing the generalization
strength of pre-trained models. Theoretically, we establish a generalization
error bound that explicitly accounts for the sparsity of parameter updates,
thereby providing a principled justification for selective fine-tuning.
Practically, we design a selection mechanism employing dual operators to
identify and update parameters exhibiting consistent and significant gradients
across all source domains. Extensive benchmark experiments demonstrate that JPS
achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art domain
generalization methods, substantiating both the efficiency and efficacy of the
proposed approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型虽然生成效果出色但计算成本过高，现有特征缓存方法因无法准确建模特征演化复杂动态而导致质量损失

Method: 利用扩散变换器中特征导数近似呈现多元高斯特性的洞察，采用Hermite多项式作为理论最优基函数，并引入双尺度机制确保数值稳定性

Conclusion: HiCache通过理论对齐和经验特性的结合，为扩散模型提供了高效且质量保持的推理加速解决方案

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in content generation but
suffer from prohibitive computational costs due to iterative sampling. While
recent feature caching methods tend to accelerate inference through temporal
extrapolation, these methods still suffer from server quality loss due to the
failure in modeling the complex dynamics of feature evolution. To solve this
problem, this paper presents HiCache, a training-free acceleration framework
that fundamentally improves feature prediction by aligning mathematical tools
with empirical properties. Our key insight is that feature derivative
approximations in Diffusion Transformers exhibit multivariate Gaussian
characteristics, motivating the use of Hermite polynomials-the potentially
theoretically optimal basis for Gaussian-correlated processes. Besides, We
further introduce a dual-scaling mechanism that ensures numerical stability
while preserving predictive accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate
HiCache's superiority: achieving 6.24x speedup on FLUX.1-dev while exceeding
baseline quality, maintaining strong performance across text-to-image, video
generation, and super-resolution tasks. Core implementation is provided in the
appendix, with complete code to be released upon acceptance.

Conclusion: 该框架为复杂环境中的高保真模拟提供了有效解决方案，特别适用于具有密雅植被、相似元素和遮挡的实际应用场景

Abstract: High-fidelity 3D simulation is critical for training mobile robots, but its
traditional reliance on mesh-based representations often struggle in complex
environments, such as densely packed greenhouses featuring occlusions and
repetitive structures. Recent neural rendering methods, like Gaussian Splatting
(GS), achieve remarkable visual realism but lack flexibility to incorporate
fiducial markers, which are essential for robotic localization and control. We
propose a hybrid framework that combines the photorealism of GS with structured
marker representations. Our core contribution is a novel algorithm for
efficiently generating GS-based fiducial markers (e.g., AprilTags) within
cluttered scenes. Experiments show that our approach outperforms traditional
image-fitting techniques in both efficiency and pose-estimation accuracy. We
further demonstrate the framework's potential in a greenhouse simulation. This
agricultural setting serves as a challenging testbed, as its combination of
dense foliage, similar-looking elements, and occlusions pushes the limits of
perception, thereby highlighting the framework's value for real-world
applications.

Abstract: Proper segmentation of organs-at-risk is important for radiation therapy,
surgical planning, and diagnostic decision-making in medical image analysis.
While deep learning-based segmentation architectures have made significant
progress, they often fail to balance segmentation accuracy with computational
efficiency. Most of the current state-of-the-art methods either prioritize
performance at the cost of high computational complexity or compromise accuracy
for efficiency. This paper addresses this gap by introducing an efficient
dual-line decoder segmentation network (EDLDNet). The proposed method features
a noisy decoder, which learns to incorporate structured perturbation at
training time for better model robustness, yet at inference time only the
noise-free decoder is executed, leading to lower computational cost.
Multi-Scale convolutional Attention Modules (MSCAMs), Attention Gates (AGs),
and Up-Convolution Blocks (UCBs) are further utilized to optimize feature
representation and boost segmentation performance. By leveraging multi-scale
segmentation masks from both decoders, we also utilize a mutation-based loss
function to enhance the model's generalization. Our approach outperforms SOTA
segmentation architectures on four publicly available medical imaging datasets.
EDLDNet achieves SOTA performance with an 84.00% Dice score on the Synapse
dataset, surpassing baseline model like UNet by 13.89% in Dice score while
significantly reducing Multiply-Accumulate Operations (MACs) by 89.7%. Compared
to recent approaches like EMCAD, our EDLDNet not only achieves higher Dice
score but also maintains comparable computational efficiency. The outstanding
performance across diverse datasets establishes EDLDNet's strong
generalization, computational efficiency, and robustness. The source code,
pre-processed data, and pre-trained weights will be available at

Abstract: 3D mapping in dynamic environments poses a challenge for modern researchers
in robotics and autonomous transportation. There are no universal
representations for dynamic 3D scenes that incorporate multimodal data such as
images, point clouds, and text. This article takes a step toward solving this
problem. It proposes a taxonomy of methods for constructing multimodal 3D maps,
classifying contemporary approaches based on scene types and representations,
learning methods, and practical applications. Using this taxonomy, a brief
structured analysis of recent methods is provided. The article also describes
an original modular method called M3DMap, designed for object-aware
construction of multimodal 3D maps for both static and dynamic scenes. It
consists of several interconnected components: a neural multimodal object
segmentation and tracking module; an odometry estimation module, including
trainable algorithms; a module for 3D map construction and updating with
various implementations depending on the desired scene representation; and a
multimodal data retrieval module. The article highlights original
implementations of these modules and their advantages in solving various
practical tasks, from 3D object grounding to mobile manipulation. Additionally,
it presents theoretical propositions demonstrating the positive effect of using
multimodal data and modern foundational models in 3D mapping methods. Details

Motivation: 现有弱监督语义分割方法过于关注类间分离，忽略了相关类别间的共享语义，缺乏细粒度区分能力

Method: 使用大型语言模型生成类别聚类来编码内在类间关系，引入类感知的patch级对比损失来增强类内一致性和类间分离

Result: 在PASCAL VOC 2012和MS COCO 2014数据集上超越了现有的最先进方法

Conclusion: CPC框架通过层次化设计利用聚类作为粗粒度语义先验，同时保持细粒度边界，有效减少了视觉相似类别间的混淆

Abstract: Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) with image-level labels has
gained attention for its cost-effectiveness. Most existing methods emphasize
inter-class separation, often neglecting the shared semantics among related
categories and lacking fine-grained discrimination. To address this, we propose
Contrastive Prompt Clustering (CPC), a novel WSSS framework. CPC exploits Large
Language Models (LLMs) to derive category clusters that encode intrinsic
inter-class relationships, and further introduces a class-aware patch-level
contrastive loss to enforce intra-class consistency and inter-class separation.
This hierarchical design leverages clusters as coarse-grained semantic priors
while preserving fine-grained boundaries, thereby reducing confusion among
visually similar categories. Experiments on PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014
demonstrate that CPC surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods in WSSS.

Motivation: 现有的场景流估计方法主要关注两帧输入，忽略了时序信息，而多帧方法随着帧数增加计算成本急剧上升。同时存在类别分布不平衡和运动不一致性的挑战

Method: 提出DeltaFlow框架：1) 使用Δ方案以最小计算成本提取时序特征；2) 引入类别平衡损失增强对少数类别的学习；3) 使用实例一致性损失确保物体运动的一致性

Result: 在Argoverse 2和Waymo数据集上达到最先进性能：误差降低22%，推理速度提升2倍，同时展现出强大的跨域泛化能力

Conclusion: DeltaFlow通过高效的时序特征提取和创新的损失函数设计，在保持计算效率的同时显著提升了场景流估计的精度和泛化能力

Abstract: Previous dominant methods for scene flow estimation focus mainly on input
from two consecutive frames, neglecting valuable information in the temporal
domain. While recent trends shift towards multi-frame reasoning, they suffer
from rapidly escalating computational costs as the number of frames grows. To
leverage temporal information more efficiently, we propose DeltaFlow
($\Delta$Flow), a lightweight 3D framework that captures motion cues via a
$\Delta$ scheme, extracting temporal features with minimal computational cost,
regardless of the number of frames. Additionally, scene flow estimation faces
challenges such as imbalanced object class distributions and motion
inconsistency. To tackle these issues, we introduce a Category-Balanced Loss to
enhance learning across underrepresented classes and an Instance Consistency
Loss to enforce coherent object motion, improving flow accuracy. Extensive
evaluations on the Argoverse 2 and Waymo datasets show that $\Delta$Flow
achieves state-of-the-art performance with up to 22% lower error and $2\times$
faster inference compared to the next-best multi-frame supervised method, while
also demonstrating a strong cross-domain generalization ability. The code is
open-sourced at https://github.com/Kin-Zhang/DeltaFlow along with trained model

TL;DR: SEER-VAR是一个新颖的以自我为中心的车辆增强现实框架，通过语义分解、上下文感知SLAM分支和LLM驱动的推荐系统，实现了动态的驾驶舱和道路场景分离，提供上下文感知的AR覆盖层。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有系统通常假设静态或单视图设置，无法有效处理动态驾驶环境中的多场景需求。为了解决这个问题，需要开发一个能够动态分离驾驶舱和道路场景，并提供上下文感知AR推荐的系统。

Method: 使用深度引导的视觉语言基础进行动态场景分离，采用两个SLAM分支分别跟踪自我中心运动，并基于GPT的模块生成上下文感知的覆盖层（如仪表盘提示和危险警报）。

Result: 实验表明SEER-VAR在不同环境中实现了稳健的空间对齐和感知一致的AR渲染。用户研究显示系统显著提升了场景理解、覆盖层相关性和驾驶便利性。

Conclusion: SEER-VAR为基于LLM的AR推荐在自我中心驾驶应用中的研究提供了有效基础，是这一方向的首批探索之一，代码和数据集将开源。

Abstract: We present SEER-VAR, a novel framework for egocentric vehicle-based augmented
reality (AR) that unifies semantic decomposition, Context-Aware SLAM Branches
(CASB), and LLM-driven recommendation. Unlike existing systems that assume
static or single-view settings, SEER-VAR dynamically separates cabin and road
scenes via depth-guided vision-language grounding. Two SLAM branches track
egocentric motion in each context, while a GPT-based module generates
context-aware overlays such as dashboard cues and hazard alerts. To support
evaluation, we introduce EgoSLAM-Drive, a real-world dataset featuring
synchronized egocentric views, 6DoF ground-truth poses, and AR annotations
across diverse driving scenarios. Experiments demonstrate that SEER-VAR
achieves robust spatial alignment and perceptually coherent AR rendering across
varied environments. As one of the first to explore LLM-based AR recommendation
in egocentric driving, we address the lack of comparable systems through
structured prompting and detailed user studies. Results show that SEER-VAR
enhances perceived scene understanding, overlay relevance, and driver ease,
providing an effective foundation for future research in this direction. Code
and dataset will be made open source.

TL;DR: 通过双正交指导(DOG)策略改善传林模型在手写文本生成中的读取性和风格变化能力，减少虚假效应和执行问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统传林模型在手写文本生成中容易记忆训练样本，在复杂风格和词汇外单词上产生虚假效应，影响生成文本的读取性

Method: 提出双正交指导(DOG)策略，利用负向提示的正交投影到原始正向提示上，在潜在空间中定义更稳定的解耦方向，并使用三角形调度控制指导强度

Result: 在DiffusionPen和One-DM模型上的实验结果显示，DOG能够显著提升生成文本的内容清晰度和风格变化能力，甚至在词汇外单词和复杂手写风格上也有良好表现

Conclusion: DOG指导策略为传林基手写文本生成提供了更有效的控制方法，能够生成更多样化且可读性更高的文本，解决了传统方法在风格变化和虚假效应方面的限制

Abstract: Diffusion-based Handwritten Text Generation (HTG) approaches achieve
impressive results on frequent, in-vocabulary words observed at training time
and on regular styles. However, they are prone to memorizing training samples
and often struggle with style variability and generation clarity. In
particular, standard diffusion models tend to produce artifacts or distortions
that negatively affect the readability of the generated text, especially when
the style is hard to produce. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel
sampling guidance strategy, Dual Orthogonal Guidance (DOG), that leverages an
orthogonal projection of a negatively perturbed prompt onto the original
positive prompt. This approach helps steer the generation away from artifacts
while maintaining the intended content, and encourages more diverse, yet
plausible, outputs. Unlike standard Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG), which
relies on unconditional predictions and produces noise at high guidance scales,
DOG introduces a more stable, disentangled direction in the latent space. To
control the strength of the guidance across the denoising process, we apply a
triangular schedule: weak at the start and end of denoising, when the process
is most sensitive, and strongest in the middle steps. Experimental results on
the state-of-the-art DiffusionPen and One-DM demonstrate that DOG improves both
content clarity and style variability, even for out-of-vocabulary words and
challenging writing styles.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于旋转分解和分支界限搜索的高效点云注册方法，通过将刚体变换分解为旋转轴翻译和2D变换，并使用扫描线算法高效求解，在保持高精度的同时显著提升了计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的点云注册方法在高离群率情况下存在问题：图基方法需要二次方空间和时间复杂度，而多阶段分支界限搜索方法容易受到局部最优解的影响导致不准确。需要一种时间复杂度为多项式、空间复杂度线性增长的更高效精确注册方法。

Method: 使用Chasles定理将刚体变换分解为沿旋转轴的翻译和2D刚体变换。通过分支界限搜索旋转轴和角度，并将剩余参数形式化为范围最大查询问题。首先在半球参数化空间中搜索top-k候选旋转轴，然后通过间隔刷新估计沿轴翻译量。接着将2D注册松弛为1D旋转角搜索，使用扫描线算法和线段树高效求解。

Result: 在3DMatch、3DLoMatch和KITTI数据集上的实验结果显示，该方法在精度和效率方面都超过了当前最先进方法。时间复杂度为多项式，空间复杂度与点数成线性关系，甚至在最坏情况下也保持这一特性。

Conclusion: 该程序提供了一种高效的点云注册解决方案，通过刚体变换的数学分解和分支界限搜索策略，成功克服了现有方法在复杂度和精度方面的限制，为高离群率环境下的点云注册问题提供了一种可扩展的高效解决方案。

Abstract: Point cloud registration based on correspondences computes the rigid
transformation that maximizes the number of inliers constrained within the
noise threshold. Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods employing spatial
compatibility graphs or branch-and-bound (BnB) search mainly focus on
registration under high outlier ratios. However, graph-based methods require at
least quadratic space and time complexity for graph construction, while
multi-stage BnB search methods often suffer from inaccuracy due to local optima
between decomposed stages. This paper proposes a geometric maximum overlapping
registration framework via rotation-only BnB search. The rigid transformation
is decomposed using Chasles' theorem into a translation along rotation axis and
a 2D rigid transformation. The optimal rotation axis and angle are searched via
BnB, with residual parameters formulated as range maximum query (RMQ) problems.
Firstly, the top-k candidate rotation axes are searched within a hemisphere
parameterized by cube mapping, and the translation along each axis is estimated
through interval stabbing of the correspondences projected onto that axis.
Secondly, the 2D registration is relaxed to 1D rotation angle search with 2D
RMQ of geometric overlapping for axis-aligned rectangles, which is solved
deterministically in polynomial time using sweep line algorithm with segment
tree. Experimental results on 3DMatch, 3DLoMatch, and KITTI datasets
demonstrate superior accuracy and efficiency over SOTA methods, while the time
complexity is polynomial and the space complexity increases linearly with the
number of points, even in the worst case.

Conclusion: PTMA模型通过概率建模和时序注意力机制有效提升了在线动作检测的视角泛化能力，为跨视角视频分析提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: As a critical task in video sequence classification within computer vision,
Online Action Detection (OAD) has garnered significant attention. The
sensitivity of mainstream OAD models to varying video viewpoints often hampers
their generalization when confronted with unseen sources. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel Probabilistic Temporal Masked Attention (PTMA)
model, which leverages probabilistic modeling to derive latent compressed
representations of video frames in a cross-view setting. The PTMA model
incorporates a GRU-based temporal masked attention (TMA) cell, which leverages
these representations to effectively query the input video sequence, thereby
enhancing information interaction and facilitating autoregressive frame-level
video analysis. Additionally, multi-view information can be integrated into the
probabilistic modeling to facilitate the extraction of view-invariant features.
Experiments conducted under three evaluation protocols: cross-subject (cs),
cross-view (cv), and cross-subject-view (csv) show that PTMA achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the DAHLIA, IKEA ASM, and Breakfast datasets.

Abstract: This work addresses the challenges of data scarcity and high acquisition
costs for training robust object detection models in complex industrial
environments, such as offshore oil platforms. The practical and economic
barriers to collecting real-world data in these hazardous settings often hamper
the development of autonomous inspection systems. To overcome this, in this
work we propose and validate a hybrid data synthesis pipeline that combines
procedural rendering with AI-driven video generation. Our methodology leverages
BlenderProc to create photorealistic images with precise annotations and
controlled domain randomization, and integrates NVIDIA's Cosmos-Predict2
world-foundation model to synthesize physically plausible video sequences with
temporal diversity, capturing rare viewpoints and adverse conditions. We
demonstrate that a YOLO-based detection network trained on a composite dataset,
blending real images with our synthetic data, achieves superior performance
compared to models trained exclusively on real-world data. Notably, a 1:1
mixture of real and synthetic data yielded the highest accuracy, surpassing the
real-only baseline. These findings highlight the viability of a synthetic-first
approach as an efficient, cost-effective, and safe alternative for developing
reliable perception systems in safety-critical and resource-constrained
industrial applications.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的局部聚焦机制(LFM)来解决现有深伪检测方法在跨物体类别和跨生成域上的精度不足问题。通过综合显著性网络和Top-K池化模块，该方法在准确率和平均精度方面都显著超过了最新的NPR方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的深度卷积网络基于重构学习的深伪检测方法存在两个核心问题：网络深度增加导致过拟合语义特征分布，从而影响在不同物体类别间的迁移能力；全局平均池化(GAP)压缩了关键的局部伪造线索，丢失了真伪分类的区分性模式。

Method: 提出局部聚焦机制(LFM)，明确关注区分性局部特征。LFM综合了显著性网络(SNet)和任务特定的Top-K池化(TKP)模块，选择K个最有信息的局部模式。为减少Top-K池化导致的过拟合风险，还引入了排名基于线性投弃(RBLD)和随机K采样(RKS)两种正则化技术来增强模型稳定性。

Result: LFM方法在准确率上比最新的邻近像素关系(NPR)方法提高3.7%，平均精度提高2.8%，同时保持了高效性，在单台NVIDIA A6000 GPU上达到1789 FPS。

Conclusion: 该研究为跨域深伪检测设置了新的标杆，通过局部特征聚焦和正则化技术有效解决了现有方法的过拟合和特征丢失问题，显著提升了模型的演进性能和通用性。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of deepfake generation techniques has intensified the
need for robust and generalizable detection methods. Existing approaches based
on reconstruction learning typically leverage deep convolutional networks to
extract differential features. However, these methods show poor generalization
across object categories (e.g., from faces to cars) and generation domains
(e.g., from GANs to Stable Diffusion), due to intrinsic limitations of deep
CNNs. First, models trained on a specific category tend to overfit to semantic
feature distributions, making them less transferable to other categories,
especially as network depth increases. Second, Global Average Pooling (GAP)
compresses critical local forgery cues into a single vector, thus discarding
discriminative patterns vital for real-fake classification. To address these
issues, we propose a novel Local Focus Mechanism (LFM) that explicitly attends
to discriminative local features for differentiating fake from real images. LFM
integrates a Salience Network (SNet) with a task-specific Top-K Pooling (TKP)
module to select the K most informative local patterns. To mitigate potential
overfitting introduced by Top-K pooling, we introduce two regularization
techniques: Rank-Based Linear Dropout (RBLD) and Random-K Sampling (RKS), which
enhance the model's robustness. LFM achieves a 3.7 improvement in accuracy and
a 2.8 increase in average precision over the state-of-the-art Neighboring Pixel
Relationships (NPR) method, while maintaining exceptional efficiency at 1789
FPS on a single NVIDIA A6000 GPU. Our approach sets a new benchmark for
cross-domain deepfake detection. The source code are available in

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: F4-ITS是一个无需训练的视觉语言模型引导框架，通过多模态特征融合和重排序机制，显著提升食品图像-文本检索性能，在资源受限环境下也能实现优异表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字食品内容的激增需要能够进行细粒度视觉理解和检索的鲁棒系统，特别是在饮食监测、智能厨房和餐厅自动化等应用中。

Method: 提出训练免费的VLM引导框架，包含单向/双向多模态融合策略（结合图像嵌入和VLM生成的文本描述）和基于特征的重排序机制（利用预测的食品成分优化检索结果）。

Result: 相比标准基线，在密集和稀疏标注场景下分别实现约10%和7.7%的top-1检索提升，以及约28.6%的top-k成分级检索增益。小模型通过文本融合可媲美或超越大模型。

Conclusion: F4-ITS框架通过有效的多模态特征融合和重排序，显著提升了食品图像-文本检索性能，且在资源受限环境下表现出色，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: The proliferation of digital food content has intensified the need for robust
and accurate systems capable of fine-grained visual understanding and
retrieval. In this work, we address the challenging task of food image-to-text
matching, a critical component in applications such as dietary monitoring,
smart kitchens, and restaurant automation. We propose F4-ITS: Fine-grained
Feature Fusion for Food Image-Text Search, a training-free, vision-language
model (VLM)-guided framework that significantly improves retrieval performance
through enhanced multi-modal feature representations. Our approach introduces
two key contributions: (1) a uni-directional(and bi-directional) multi-modal
fusion strategy that combines image embeddings with VLM-generated textual
descriptions to improve query expressiveness, and (2) a novel feature-based
re-ranking mechanism for top-k retrieval, leveraging predicted food ingredients
to refine results and boost precision. Leveraging open-source image-text
encoders, we demonstrate substantial gains over standard baselines - achieving
~10% and ~7.7% improvements in top-1 retrieval under dense and sparse caption
scenarios, and a ~28.6% gain in top-k ingredient-level retrieval. Additionally,
we show that smaller models (e.g., ViT-B/32) can match or outperform larger
counterparts (e.g., ViT-H, ViT-G, ViT-bigG) when augmented with textual fusion,
highlighting the effectiveness of our method in resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: We present StyleClone, a method for training image-to-image translation
networks to stylize faces in a specific style, even with limited style images.
Our approach leverages textual inversion and diffusion-based guided image
generation to augment small style datasets. By systematically generating
diverse style samples guided by both the original style images and real face
images, we significantly enhance the diversity of the style dataset. Using this
augmented dataset, we train fast image-to-image translation networks that
outperform diffusion-based methods in speed and quality. Experiments on
multiple styles demonstrate that our method improves stylization quality,
better preserves source image content, and significantly accelerates inference.
Additionally, we provide a systematic evaluation of the augmentation techniques

Motivation: 室外3D场景理解依赖高质量点云，但LiDAR扫描数据通常极其稀疏，现有上采样方法主要针对单个物体，在复杂室外场景中泛化能力有限

Method: 采用无分类器引导的DDPM扩散模型，以稀疏点云为引导条件，邻近帧合成点云为输入；设计体素补全模块细化特征，点-体素交互模块整合两种特征表示

Result: 在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能，是首个支持任意上采样倍率的场景级点云上采样方法

Conclusion: PVNet通过扩散模型和点-体素交互机制，有效解决了室外场景点云稀疏问题，显著提升了3D感知任务的性能

Abstract: Accurate 3D scene understanding in outdoor environments heavily relies on
high-quality point clouds. However, LiDAR-scanned data often suffer from
extreme sparsity, severely hindering downstream 3D perception tasks. Existing
point cloud upsampling methods primarily focus on individual objects, thus
demonstrating limited generalization capability for complex outdoor scenes. To
address this issue, we propose PVNet, a diffusion model-based point-voxel
interaction framework to perform LiDAR point cloud upsampling without dense
supervision. Specifically, we adopt the classifier-free guidance-based DDPMs to
guide the generation, in which we employ a sparse point cloud as the guiding
condition and the synthesized point clouds derived from its nearby frames as
the input. Moreover, we design a voxel completion module to refine and complete
the coarse voxel features for enriching the feature representation. In
addition, we propose a point-voxel interaction module to integrate features
from both points and voxels, which efficiently improves the environmental
perception capability of each upsampled point. To the best of our knowledge,
our approach is the first scene-level point cloud upsampling method supporting
arbitrary upsampling rates. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. The source
code will be available at https://github.com/chengxianjing/PVNet.

Conclusion: REGEN框架能够在保持高视觉质量的前提下实现实时照相约质增强，为游戏实时渲染提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Photorealism is an important aspect of modern video games since it can shape
the player experience and simultaneously impact the immersion, narrative
engagement, and visual fidelity. Although recent hardware technological
breakthroughs, along with state-of-the-art rendering technologies, have
significantly improved the visual realism of video games, achieving true
photorealism in dynamic environments at real-time frame rates still remains a
major challenge due to the tradeoff between visual quality and performance. In
this short paper, we present a novel approach for enhancing the photorealism of
rendered game frames using generative adversarial networks. To this end, we
propose Real-time photorealism Enhancement in Games via a dual-stage gEnerative
Network framework (REGEN), which employs a robust unpaired image-to-image
translation model to produce semantically consistent photorealistic frames that
transform the problem into a simpler paired image-to-image translation task.
This enables training with a lightweight method that can achieve real-time
inference time without compromising visual quality. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our framework on Grand Theft Auto V, showing that the approach
achieves visual results comparable to the ones produced by the robust unpaired
Im2Im method while improving inference speed by 32.14 times. Our findings also
indicate that the results outperform the photorealism-enhanced frames produced
by directly training a lightweight unpaired Im2Im translation method to
translate the video game frames towards the visual characteristics of
real-world images. Code, pre-trained models, and demos for this work are

TL;DR: SSG-DiT是一个新颖的可控视频生成框架，通过空间信号引导和双阶段解耦设计，显著提升了视频生成中的语义一致性和空间关系控制能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可控视频生成模型在保持语义一致性方面存在困难，经常生成与提示细节不符的视频内容，需要解决这一核心挑战。

Method: 提出两阶段解耦过程：1）空间信号提示阶段利用预训练多模态模型生成空间感知视觉提示；2）通过轻量级SSG-Adapter将联合条件注入冻结的视频DiT骨干网络，采用双分支注意力机制。

Result: 在VBench基准测试中达到最先进性能，在空间关系控制和整体一致性等关键指标上超越现有模型。

Conclusion: SSG-DiT框架通过空间信号引导和高效适配器设计，成功解决了可控视频生成中的语义一致性问题，为高质量视频合成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Controllable video generation aims to synthesize video content that aligns
precisely with user-provided conditions, such as text descriptions and initial
images. However, a significant challenge persists in this domain: existing
models often struggle to maintain strong semantic consistency, frequently
generating videos that deviate from the nuanced details specified in the
prompts. To address this issue, we propose SSG-DiT (Spatial Signal Guided
Diffusion Transformer), a novel and efficient framework for high-fidelity
controllable video generation. Our approach introduces a decoupled two-stage
process. The first stage, Spatial Signal Prompting, generates a spatially aware
visual prompt by leveraging the rich internal representations of a pre-trained
multi-modal model. This prompt, combined with the original text, forms a joint
condition that is then injected into a frozen video DiT backbone via our
lightweight and parameter-efficient SSG-Adapter. This unique design, featuring
a dual-branch attention mechanism, allows the model to simultaneously harness
its powerful generative priors while being precisely steered by external
spatial signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SSG-DiT achieves
state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing models on multiple key
metrics in the VBench benchmark, particularly in spatial relationship control
and overall consistency.

*Haoyu Yun,Hamid Krim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的框架，将视觉Transformer与近端工具相结合，通过统一的几何优化方法来改善特征表征和分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管ViT在计算机视觉中取得了显著成功，但其优化仅限于模型单张图像内部的局部关系，无法捐捕数据点之间的全局几何关系。

Method: 通过ViT的自注意力机制构建流形的切线束，每个注意力头对应一个切线空间，提供来自不同局部视角的几何表征。然后引入近端迭代定义切线束内的截面并将数据从切线空间投影到基空间。

Result: 实验结果证实，所提方法在分类准确性和数据分布方面都超过传统ViT方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合流形几何与近端优化工具，有效地扩展了ViT的能力，能够捐捕全局几何关系，提升了特征表征和分类性能。

Abstract: The Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture has become widely recognized in
computer vision, leveraging its self-attention mechanism to achieve remarkable
success across various tasks. Despite its strengths, ViT's optimization remains
confined to modeling local relationships within individual images, limiting its
ability to capture the global geometric relationships between data points. To
address this limitation, this paper proposes a novel framework that integrates
ViT with the proximal tools, enabling a unified geometric optimization approach
to enhance feature representation and classification performance. In this
framework, ViT constructs the tangent bundle of the manifold through its
self-attention mechanism, where each attention head corresponds to a tangent
space, offering geometric representations from diverse local perspectives.
Proximal iterations are then introduced to define sections within the tangent
bundle and project data from tangent spaces onto the base space, achieving
global feature alignment and optimization. Experimental results confirm that
the proposed method outperforms traditional ViT in terms of classification
accuracy and data distribution.

Motivation: 现有深度度量学习方法存在局限性：成对损失需要复杂采样且收敛慢；基于代理的方法可扩展性好但无法优化全局分布特性；D-Loss关注分布可分性但计算开销大

Method: 通过代理估计真实分布和冒名分布，将可学习代理与统计框架d'相结合，在保持代理方法计算效率的同时实现分布感知的嵌入优化

Result: 在细粒度分类和人脸验证等任务上达到与最先进方法相当的性能，同时提供了嵌入优化的新视角

Conclusion: PD-Loss成功结合了代理方法的计算效率和基于统计的可分性优化，为分布感知的深度度量学习提供了可扩展的解决方案

Abstract: Deep Metric Learning (DML) aims to learn embedding functions that map
semantically similar inputs to proximate points in a metric space while
separating dissimilar ones. Existing methods, such as pairwise losses, are
hindered by complex sampling requirements and slow convergence. In contrast,
proxy-based losses, despite their improved scalability, often fail to optimize
global distribution properties. The Decidability-based Loss (D-Loss) addresses
this by targeting the decidability index (d') to enhance distribution
separability, but its reliance on large mini-batches imposes significant
computational constraints. We introduce Proxy-Decidability Loss (PD-Loss), a
novel objective that integrates learnable proxies with the statistical
framework of d' to optimize embedding spaces efficiently. By estimating genuine
and impostor distributions through proxies, PD-Loss combines the computational
efficiency of proxy-based methods with the principled separability of D-Loss,
offering a scalable approach to distribution-aware DML. Experiments across
various tasks, including fine-grained classification and face verification,
demonstrate that PD-Loss achieves performance comparable to that of
state-of-the-art methods while introducing a new perspective on embedding
optimization, with potential for broader applications.

TL;DR: GRASP是一个基于强化学习的结构化策略学习框架，通过多模态大语言模型生成边界框和正点提示，再由预训练分割模型生成最终掩码，无需密集像素监督，在域内外数据集上均取得显著性能提升


<details>

Motivation: 现有的MLLM系统需要密集像素监督进行联合训练，成本高昂且在域外数据上表现不佳。为了解决这些问题，作者提出了一个无需掩码监督的强化学习框架

Method: 使用多模态大语言模型生成任务相关的边界框和正点，然后将其作为提示输入到预训练分割模型中生成最终掩码。采用GRPO强化学习算法，仅使用格式奖励和准确性奖励进行训练

Result: 在域内测试集上提升约4%，在域外基准测试上提升高达54%，证明了模型具有强大的泛化能力

Conclusion: 复杂的地理空间分割行为可以通过强化学习从弱空间线索中学习，该方法利用了基础模型的强先验，最小化了可训练参数，并能从廉价标注中学习

Abstract: Geospatial pixel reasoning is a nascent remote-sensing task that aims to
generate segmentation masks directly from natural-language instructions.
Prevailing MLLM-based systems co-train a language model and a mask decoder with
dense pixel supervision, which is expensive and often weak on out-of-domain
(OOD) data. We introduce GRASP, a structured policy-learning framework. In our
design, a multimodal large language model first emits task-relevant bounding
boxes and positive points from a vision-language instruction. These outputs are
then passed to a pre-trained segmentation model, which consumes them as prompts
to generate the final mask. Instead of supervised fine-tuning, we optimize the
system purely with reinforcement learning: the model is trained solely with
GRPO, guided by format rewards and accuracy rewards computed on boxes and
points (no mask supervision). This leverages strong priors in foundation
models, minimizes trainable parameters, and enables learning from inexpensive
annotations. We additionally curate GRASP-1k, which contains
reasoning-intensive queries, detailed reasoning traces, and fine-grained
segmentation annotations. Evaluations on both in-domain and out-of-domain test
sets show state-of-the-art results: about 4% improvement in-domain and up to
54% on OOD benchmarks. The experiment results evidence our model's robust
generalization and demonstrate that complex geospatial segmentation behaviors
can be learned via RL from weak spatial cues. Code and the dataset will be
released open-source.

Abstract: Despite progress in AI-based plant diagnostics, sugarcane farmers in
low-resource regions remain vulnerable to leaf diseases due to the lack of
scalable, efficient, and interpretable tools. Many deep learning models fail to
generalize under real-world conditions and require substantial computational
resources, limiting their use in resource-constrained regions. In this paper,
we present SugarcaneLD-BD, a curated dataset for sugarcane leaf-disease
classification; SugarcaneShuffleNet, an optimized lightweight model for rapid
on-device diagnosis; and SugarcaneAI, a Progressive Web Application for field
deployment. SugarcaneLD-BD contains 638 curated images across five classes,
including four major sugarcane diseases, collected in Bangladesh under diverse
field conditions and verified by expert pathologists. To enhance diversity, we
combined SugarcaneLD-BD with two additional datasets, yielding a larger and
more representative corpus. Our optimized model, SugarcaneShuffleNet, offers
the best trade-off between speed and accuracy for real-time, on-device
diagnosis. This 9.26 MB model achieved 98.02% accuracy, an F1-score of 0.98,
and an average inference time of 4.14 ms per image. For comparison, we
fine-tuned five other lightweight convolutional neural networks: MnasNet,
EdgeNeXt, EfficientNet-Lite, MobileNet, and SqueezeNet via transfer learning
and Bayesian optimization. MnasNet and EdgeNeXt achieved comparable accuracy to
SugarcaneShuffleNet, but required significantly more parameters, memory, and
computation, limiting their suitability for low-resource deployment. We
integrate SugarcaneShuffleNet into SugarcaneAI, delivering Grad-CAM-based
explanations in the field. Together, these contributions offer a diverse
benchmark, efficient models for low-resource environments, and a practical tool
for sugarcane disease classification. It spans varied lighting, backgrounds and
devices used on-farm

Motivation: 传统CNN和Transformer在脑肿瘤MRI分类中存在计算成本高、对对比度变化敏感、结构异质性和纹理不一致等挑战，需要开发更有效的混合架构。

Method: 整合四个核心创新：1）平滑边界CNN集成Transformer（SBCIT）；2）定制残差和空间学习CNN；3）通道增强策略；4）新型空间注意力机制，通过stem卷积和上下文交互Transformer块实现全局特征建模。

Result: 在Kaggle和Figshare的脑肿瘤MRI数据集（包含胶质瘤、脑膜瘤、垂体瘤和健康对照）上取得优异性能：准确率98.30%、灵敏度98.08%、F1分数98.25%、精确度98.43%。

Conclusion: CE-RS-SBCIT框架通过有效整合局部细粒度和全局上下文特征，显著提升了脑肿瘤分类的准确性和鲁棒性，为计算机辅助诊断系统提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Brain tumors remain among the most lethal human diseases, where early
detection and accurate classification are critical for effective diagnosis and
treatment planning. Although deep learning-based computer-aided diagnostic
(CADx) systems have shown remarkable progress. However, conventional
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformers face persistent
challenges, including high computational cost, sensitivity to minor contrast
variations, structural heterogeneity, and texture inconsistencies in MRI data.
Therefore, a novel hybrid framework, CE-RS-SBCIT, is introduced, integrating
residual and spatial learning-based CNNs with transformer-driven modules. The
proposed framework exploits local fine-grained and global contextual cues
through four core innovations: (i) a smoothing and boundary-based
CNN-integrated Transformer (SBCIT), (ii) tailored residual and spatial learning
CNNs, (iii) a channel enhancement (CE) strategy, and (iv) a novel spatial
attention mechanism. The developed SBCIT employs stem convolution and
contextual interaction transformer blocks with systematic smoothing and
boundary operations, enabling efficient global feature modeling. Moreover,
Residual and spatial CNNs, enhanced by auxiliary transfer-learned feature maps,
enrich the representation space, while the CE module amplifies discriminative
channels and mitigates redundancy. Furthermore, the spatial attention mechanism
selectively emphasizes subtle contrast and textural variations across tumor
classes. Extensive evaluation on challenging MRI datasets from Kaggle and
Figshare, encompassing glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumors, and healthy
controls, demonstrates superior performance, achieving 98.30% accuracy, 98.08%
sensitivity, 98.25% F1-score, and 98.43% precision.

Abstract: Natural disasters pose significant challenges to timely and accurate damage
assessment due to their sudden onset and the extensive areas they affect.
Traditional assessment methods are often labor-intensive, costly, and hazardous
to personnel, making them impractical for rapid response, especially in
resource-limited settings. This study proposes a novel, cost-effective
framework that leverages aerial drone footage, an advanced AI-based video
super-resolution model, Video Restoration Transformer (VRT), and Gemma3:27b, a
27 billion parameter Visual Language Model (VLM). This integrated system is
designed to improve low-resolution disaster footage, identify structural
damage, and classify buildings into four damage categories, ranging from
no/slight damage to total destruction, along with associated risk levels. The
methodology was validated using pre- and post-event drone imagery from the 2023
Turkey earthquakes (courtesy of The Guardian) and satellite data from the 2013
Moore Tornado (xBD dataset). The framework achieved a classification accuracy
of 84.5%, demonstrating its ability to provide highly accurate results.
Furthermore, the system's accessibility allows non-technical users to perform

Abstract: Traditional video-based learning remains passive, offering limited
opportunities for users to engage dynamically with content. While current
AI-powered tools offer transcription and summarization, they lack real-time,
region-specific interaction capabilities. This paper introduces Untwist, an
AI-driven system that enables interactive video learning by allowing users to
ask questions about the entire video or specific regions using a bounding box,
receiving context-aware, multimodal responses. By integrating GPT APIs with
Computer Vision techniques, Untwist extracts, processes, and structures video
content to enhance comprehension. Our approach addresses GPT-4o spatial
weakness by leveraging annotated frames instead of raw coordinate data,
significantly improving accuracy in localizing and interpreting video content.
This paper describes the system architecture, including video pre-processing
and real-time interaction, and outlines how Untwist can transform passive video
consumption into an interactive, AI-driven learning experience with the
potential to enhance engagement and comprehension.

TL;DR: 使用隐式神经网络表示方法，结合T1和T2杀催MRI的分辨率优势，建立同向异性高分辨率脑图集，提高内侧颔叶子区域分割精度，改善阻塞洋麻症形态学标记物的准确性和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 内侧颔叶子是阻塞洋麻症最早受影响的区域，但T2杀催MRI的同向异性分辨率导致直觉层子区域厚度提取困难，影响病变跟踪的准确性。

Method: 采用隐式神经网络表示方法，结合T1杀催和T2杀催MRI的分辨率优势，将同向异性空间的MTL子区域脑图集准确地向上采样到同向性空间，建立多模态高分辨率脑图集，并基于此开发同向性MTL子区域分割模型。

Result: 在独立测试集中，使用同向性模型提取的直觉子区域厚度在区分轻度认知障碍和认知正常参与者时显示出更高的显著性。在纵向分析中，同向性方法提取的标记物在认知正常参与者中显示出更大的稳定性。

Conclusion: 该研究在不增加脑图注释工作量的情况下提高了AD形态学标记物的准确性，有助于更准确地定量AD与脑萎缩之间的关系，为疾病跟踪提供更准确的测量手段。

Abstract: Imaging biomarkers in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are important tools
for diagnosing and tracking Alzheimer's disease (AD). As medial temporal lobe
(MTL) is the earliest region to show AD-related hallmarks, brain atrophy caused
by AD can first be observed in the MTL. Accurate segmentation of MTL subregions
and extraction of imaging biomarkers from them are important. However, due to
imaging limitations, the resolution of T2-weighted (T2w) MRI is anisotropic,
which makes it difficult to accurately extract the thickness of cortical
subregions in the MTL. In this study, we used an implicit neural representation
method to combine the resolution advantages of T1-weighted and T2w MRI to
accurately upsample an MTL subregion atlas set from anisotropic space to
isotropic space, establishing a multi-modality, high-resolution atlas set.
Based on this atlas, we developed an isotropic MTL subregion segmentation
model. In an independent test set, the cortical subregion thickness extracted
using this isotropic model showed higher significance than an anisotropic
method in distinguishing between participants with mild cognitive impairment
and cognitively unimpaired (CU) participants. In longitudinal analysis, the
biomarkers extracted using isotropic method showed greater stability in CU
participants. This study improved the accuracy of AD imaging biomarkers without
increasing the amount of atlas annotation work, which may help to more
accurately quantify the relationship between AD and brain atrophy and provide
more accurate measures for disease tracking.

TL;DR: 提出AdvCP方法解决弱监督变化检测中的背景噪声问题，通过对抗性提示挖掘和样本校正来提升性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 弱监督变化检测仅使用图像级标签，容易将背景变化误判为目标变化，特别是在复杂的遥感场景中

Method: AdvCP包含两个阶段：对抗性提示挖掘（使用错误标签激活错误特征映射）和对抗性样本校正（构建在线全局原型整合样本）

Result: 在ConvNet、Transformer和SAM基线上显著提升性能，且可推广到其他多类弱监督密集预测场景

Conclusion: AdvCP能有效解决弱监督变化检测中的共现噪声问题，无需增加推理成本，具有良好通用性

Abstract: Weakly-Supervised Change Detection (WSCD) aims to distinguish specific object
changes (e.g., objects appearing or disappearing) from background variations
(e.g., environmental changes due to light, weather, or seasonal shifts) in
paired satellite images, relying only on paired image (i.e., image-level)
classification labels. This technique significantly reduces the need for dense
annotations required in fully-supervised change detection. However, as
image-level supervision only indicates whether objects have changed in a scene,
WSCD methods often misclassify background variations as object changes,
especially in complex remote-sensing scenarios. In this work, we propose an
Adversarial Class Prompting (AdvCP) method to address this co-occurring noise
problem, including two phases: a) Adversarial Prompt Mining: After each
training iteration, we introduce adversarial prompting perturbations, using
incorrect one-hot image-level labels to activate erroneous feature mappings.
This process reveals co-occurring adversarial samples under weak supervision,
namely background variation features that are likely to be misclassified as
object changes. b) Adversarial Sample Rectification: We integrate these
adversarially prompt-activated pixel samples into training by constructing an
online global prototype. This prototype is built from an exponentially weighted
moving average of the current batch and all historical training data. Our AdvCP
can be seamlessly integrated into current WSCD methods without adding
additional inference cost. Experiments on ConvNet, Transformer, and Segment
Anything Model (SAM)-based baselines demonstrate significant performance
enhancements. Furthermore, we demonstrate the generalizability of AdvCP to
other multi-class weakly-supervised dense prediction scenarios. Code is

Motivation: 解决文档封面图像生成任务缺乏高质量数据集的问题

Method: 收集含多张图像和说明文字的文档，通过图像和说明文字的独立排名选择最佳匹配，构建高质量假标签数据集

Result: 多模态假标签方法构建的数据集更精确，生成的图像质量更高，超越了单纯文本或图像假标签方法

Conclusion: 多模态假标签方法能够以低成本构建高质量的文档封面图像生成数据集

Abstract: In this study, we introduce a novel cover image generation task that produces
both a concise summary and a visually corresponding image from a given
text-only document. Because no existing datasets are available for this task,
we propose a multimodal pseudo-labeling method to construct high-quality
datasets at low cost. We first collect documents that contain multiple images
with their captions, and their summaries by excluding factually inconsistent
instances. Our approach selects one image from the multiple images accompanying
the documents. Using the gold summary, we independently rank both the images
and their captions. Then, we annotate a pseudo-label for an image when both the
image and its corresponding caption are ranked first in their respective
rankings. Finally, we remove documents that contain direct image references
within texts. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed multimodal
pseudo-labeling method constructs more precise datasets and generates higher
quality images than text- and image-only pseudo-labeling methods, which
consider captions and images separately. We release our code at:

Motivation: 需要开发一个既能处理高速公路多种关键感知任务（天气分类、路面湿度评估、交通拥堵检测），又能平衡准确性和计算效率的综合性系统，特别是在资源受限环境中实现实时监控和预警。

Method: 采用多智能体框架，使用大型通用视觉语言模型（如GPT-4o）生成任务特定的思维链提示，然后指导小型高效VLM（如Qwen2.5-VL-7B）对短视频和多模态数据进行推理。构建了三个专门数据集进行验证。

Conclusion: 该框架可轻松集成到现有交通摄像头系统中，应用于高风险农村地区进行持续监控，提升态势感知能力并提供及时警报，适用于资源受限环境。

Abstract: This paper introduces a multi-agent framework for comprehensive highway scene
understanding, designed around a mixture-of-experts strategy. In this
framework, a large generic vision-language model (VLM), such as GPT-4o, is
contextualized with domain knowledge to generates task-specific
chain-of-thought (CoT) prompts. These fine-grained prompts are then used to
guide a smaller, efficient VLM (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL-7B) in reasoning over short
videos, along with complementary modalities as applicable. The framework
simultaneously addresses multiple critical perception tasks, including weather
classification, pavement wetness assessment, and traffic congestion detection,
achieving robust multi-task reasoning while balancing accuracy and
computational efficiency. To support empirical validation, we curated three
specialized datasets aligned with these tasks. Notably, the pavement wetness
dataset is multimodal, combining video streams with road weather sensor data,
highlighting the benefits of multimodal reasoning. Experimental results
demonstrate consistently strong performance across diverse traffic and
environmental conditions. From a deployment perspective, the framework can be
readily integrated with existing traffic camera systems and strategically
applied to high-risk rural locations, such as sharp curves, flood-prone
lowlands, or icy bridges. By continuously monitoring the targeted sites, the
system enhances situational awareness and delivers timely alerts, even in
resource-constrained environments.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了多模态数据获取难题，在仅使用病理切片的情况下仍能获得准确的生物标志物预测结果

Abstract: Immunohistochemical (IHC) biomarker prediction benefits from multi-modal data
fusion analysis. However, the simultaneous acquisition of multi-modal data,
such as genomic and pathological information, is often challenging due to cost
or technical limitations. To address this challenge, we propose an online
distillation approach based on Multi-modal Knowledge Decomposition (MKD) to
enhance IHC biomarker prediction in haematoxylin and eosin (H\&E) stained
histopathology images. This method leverages paired genomic-pathology data
during training while enabling inference using either pathology slides alone or
both modalities. Two teacher and one student models are developed to extract
modality-specific and modality-general features by minimizing the MKD loss. To
maintain the internal structural relationships between samples,
Similarity-preserving Knowledge Distillation (SKD) is applied. Additionally,
Collaborative Learning for Online Distillation (CLOD) facilitates mutual
learning between teacher and student models, encouraging diverse and
complementary learning dynamics. Experiments on the TCGA-BRCA and in-house QHSU
datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance in IHC
biomarker prediction using uni-modal data. Our code is available at

Conclusion: 注意力增强的CNN结合针对性损失优化和预处理，能够产生更具判别性的白血病细胞形态表征，为临床提供高效准确的自动化诊断工具

Abstract: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a prevalent hematological malignancy in
both pediatric and adult populations. Early and accurate detection with precise
subtyping is essential for guiding therapy. Conventional workflows are complex,
time-consuming, and prone to human error. We present a deep learning framework
for automated ALL diagnosis from bone marrow smear images. The method combines
a robust preprocessing pipeline with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to
standardize image quality and improve inference efficiency. As a key design, we
insert a multi-head self-attention (MHSA) block into a VGG19 backbone to model
long-range dependencies and contextual relationships among cellular features.
To mitigate class imbalance, we train with Focal Loss. Across evaluated
architectures, the enhanced VGG19+MHSA trained with Focal Loss achieves 99.25%
accuracy, surpassing a strong ResNet101 baseline (98.62%). These results
indicate that attention-augmented CNNs, coupled with targeted loss optimization
and preprocessing, yield more discriminative representations of leukemic cell
morphology. Our approach offers a highly accurate and computationally efficient
tool for automated ALL recognition and subtyping, with potential to accelerate
diagnostic workflows and support reliable decision-making in clinical settings.

Motivation: 现有的视觉预训练主要基于2D图像，忽略了世界的3D本质，但由于大规模3D数据稀缺，难以从网络数据中提取通用3D表示

Method: 将视觉预训练目标构建为下一个点云预测问题，使用扩散模型进行建模，并在大型公共数据集上直接预训练

Result: 在12个真实世界操作任务中，FVP将3D Diffusion Policy的平均成功率提升28%，达到模仿学习方法的最先进性能，并能适应不同的点云编码器和数据集

Conclusion: FVP框架有效提升了3D表示性能，可应用于不同模型架构，包括大型视觉-语言-动作机器人模型RDT-1B，在各种机器人任务中表现出色

Abstract: General visual representations learned from web-scale datasets for robotics
have achieved great success in recent years, enabling data-efficient robot
learning on manipulation tasks; yet these pre-trained representations are
mostly on 2D images, neglecting the inherent 3D nature of the world. However,
due to the scarcity of large-scale 3D data, it is still hard to extract a
universal 3D representation from web datasets. Instead, we are seeking a
general visual pre-training framework that could improve all 3D representations
as an alternative. Our framework, called FVP, is a novel 4D Visual Pre-training
framework for real-world robot learning. FVP frames the visual pre-training
objective as a next-point-cloud-prediction problem, models the prediction model
as a diffusion model, and pre-trains the model on the larger public datasets
directly. Across twelve real-world manipulation tasks, FVP boosts the average
success rate of 3D Diffusion Policy (DP3) for these tasks by 28%. The FVP
pre-trained DP3 achieves state-of-the-art performance across imitation learning
methods. Moreover, the efficacy of FVP adapts across various point cloud
encoders and datasets. Finally, we apply FVP to the RDT-1B, a larger
Vision-Language-Action robotic model, enhancing its performance on various

TL;DR: PersPose是一个新的单目3D人体姿态估计框架，通过透视编码(PE)和透视旋转(PR)技术，解决了裁剪图像中相机内参缺失和透视失真问题，在多个数据集上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D人体姿态估计方法仅使用裁剪图像作为输入，但缺少相机内参信息导致关节相对深度估计不准确，且人体偏离图像中心时会产生透视失真，增加了模型拟合难度。

Method: 提出PersPose框架：1) 透视编码(PE)编码裁剪图像的相机内参；2) 透视旋转(PR)将人体置于图像中心以减少透视失真。结合这两种技术提升3D姿态估计精度。

Result: 在3DPW、MPI-INF-3DHP和Human3.6M数据集上达到state-of-the-art性能。在3DPW数据集上MPJPE为60.1mm，比之前最佳方法降低7.54%。

Conclusion: PersPose通过有效处理相机内参和透视失真问题，显著提升了单目3D人体姿态估计的精度，证明了考虑相机几何信息的重要性。

Abstract: Monocular 3D human pose estimation (HPE) methods estimate the 3D positions of
joints from individual images. Existing 3D HPE approaches often use the cropped
image alone as input for their models. However, the relative depths of joints
cannot be accurately estimated from cropped images without the corresponding
camera intrinsics, which determine the perspective relationship between 3D
objects and the cropped images. In this work, we introduce Perspective Encoding
(PE) to encode the camera intrinsics of the cropped images. Moreover, since the
human subject can appear anywhere within the original image, the perspective
relationship between the 3D scene and the cropped image differs significantly,
which complicates model fitting. Additionally, the further the human subject
deviates from the image center, the greater the perspective distortions in the
cropped image. To address these issues, we propose Perspective Rotation (PR), a
transformation applied to the original image that centers the human subject,
thereby reducing perspective distortions and alleviating the difficulty of
model fitting. By incorporating PE and PR, we propose a novel 3D HPE framework,
PersPose. Experimental results demonstrate that PersPose achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the 3DPW, MPIINF-3DHP, and Human3.6M
datasets. For example, on the in-the-wild dataset 3DPW, PersPose achieves an
MPJPE of 60.1 mm, 7.54% lower than the previous SOTA approach. Code is

TL;DR: CoViPAL是一种层级的上下文视觉token剪枝方法，通过轻量级插件模块在LVLM处理前预测并移除冗余视觉token，显著提升推理效率而不损失精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型处理图像时产生大量视觉token，导致计算成本高和内存开销大。现有剪枝方法在浅层缺乏足够上下文信息时效果不佳，但许多视觉token在浅层就已冗余，需要合适的上下文信号进行有效剪枝。

Method: 提出CoViPAL方法，使用即插即用剪枝模块(PPM)在LVLM处理前预测并移除冗余视觉token。PPM轻量级、模型无关，可独立于LVLM架构运行，确保与各种模型无缝集成。

Result: 在多个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，CoViPAL在相同token预算下优于无训练剪枝方法，在可比监督下超越基于训练的方法。

Conclusion: CoViPAL为提升LVLM推理效率提供了可扩展的高效解决方案，在不影响准确性的前提下显著降低计算和内存开销。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) process multimodal inputs consisting of
text tokens and vision tokens extracted from images or videos. Due to the rich
visual information, a single image can generate thousands of vision tokens,
leading to high computational costs during the prefilling stage and significant
memory overhead during decoding. Existing methods attempt to prune redundant
vision tokens, revealing substantial redundancy in visual representations.
However, these methods often struggle in shallow layers due to the lack of
sufficient contextual information. We argue that many visual tokens are
inherently redundant even in shallow layers and can be safely and effectively
pruned with appropriate contextual signals. In this work, we propose CoViPAL, a
layer-wise contextualized visual token pruning method that employs a
Plug-and-Play Pruning Module (PPM) to predict and remove redundant vision
tokens before they are processed by the LVLM. The PPM is lightweight,
model-agnostic, and operates independently of the LVLM architecture, ensuring
seamless integration with various models. Extensive experiments on multiple
benchmarks demonstrate that CoViPAL outperforms training-free pruning methods
under equal token budgets and surpasses training-based methods with comparable
supervision. CoViPAL offers a scalable and efficient solution to improve
inference efficiency in LVLMs without compromising accuracy.

Motivation: 随着深度伪造技术的快速发展和数字媒体的广泛传播，个人隐私面临严重安全威胁。现有深度伪造主动取证方法依赖于单一水印嵌入的理想假设，但在现实场景中可能遭受多重嵌入攻击，导致原始取证水印被破坏或移除。

Method: 提出对抗干扰模拟(AIS)训练范式，在微调过程中显式模拟MEA场景，并引入韧性驱动的损失函数来学习稀疏且稳定的水印表示，而不需要修改网络架构。

Result: 大量实验表明，AIS训练范式显著增强了各种现有方法对MEA的鲁棒性，使模型在遭受二次水印嵌入后仍能正确提取原始水印。

Conclusion: AIS作为一种即插即用的训练范式，有效解决了多重嵌入攻击对深度伪造主动取证系统的威胁，为实际应用提供了更可靠的保护机制。

Abstract: With the rapid evolution of deepfake technologies and the wide dissemination
of digital media, personal privacy is facing increasingly serious security
threats. Deepfake proactive forensics, which involves embedding imperceptible
watermarks to enable reliable source tracking, serves as a crucial defense
against these threats. Although existing methods show strong forensic ability,
they rely on an idealized assumption of single watermark embedding, which
proves impractical in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we formally define
and demonstrate the existence of Multi-Embedding Attacks (MEA) for the first
time. When a previously protected image undergoes additional rounds of
watermark embedding, the original forensic watermark can be destroyed or
removed, rendering the entire proactive forensic mechanism ineffective. To
address this vulnerability, we propose a general training paradigm named
Adversarial Interference Simulation (AIS). Rather than modifying the network
architecture, AIS explicitly simulates MEA scenarios during fine-tuning and
introduces a resilience-driven loss function to enforce the learning of sparse
and stable watermark representations. Our method enables the model to maintain
the ability to extract the original watermark correctly even after a second
embedding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our plug-and-play AIS
training paradigm significantly enhances the robustness of various existing
methods against MEA.

Motivation: 当前深度神经网络在真实任务中表现优异，但无法像人类一样感知错觉轮廓（如abutting grating），这种感知差异阻碍了机器智能与人类认知的对齐。

Method: 受视觉皮层回路启发，设计ICPNet网络：1）多尺度特征投影模块提取多尺度表示；2）特征交互注意力模块增强前馈和反馈特征交互；3）边缘融合模块通过边缘检测任务注入形状约束，引导网络关注前景。

Result: 在AG-MNIST和新建的AG-Fashion-MNIST测试集上，ICPNet对错觉轮廓的敏感性显著优于最先进模型，在各种子集上的top-1准确率都有显著提升。

Conclusion: 该工作向基于DNN的模型实现人类水平智能迈进了一步，解决了DNN与人类在错觉轮廓感知上的差异问题。

Abstract: Higher levels of machine intelligence demand alignment with human perception
and cognition. Deep neural networks (DNN) dominated machine intelligence have
demonstrated exceptional performance across various real-world tasks.
Nevertheless, recent evidence suggests that DNNs fail to perceive illusory
contours like the abutting grating, a discrepancy that misaligns with human
perception patterns. Departing from previous works, we propose a novel deep
network called illusory contour perception network (ICPNet) inspired by the
circuits of the visual cortex. In ICPNet, a multi-scale feature projection
(MFP) module is designed to extract multi-scale representations. To boost the
interaction between feedforward and feedback features, a feature interaction
attention module (FIAM) is introduced. Moreover, drawing inspiration from the
shape bias observed in human perception, an edge detection task conducted via
the edge fusion module (EFM) injects shape constraints that guide the network
to concentrate on the foreground. We assess our method on the existing AG-MNIST
test set and the AG-Fashion-MNIST test sets constructed by this work.
Comprehensive experimental results reveal that ICPNet is significantly more
sensitive to abutting grating illusory contours than state-of-the-art models,
with notable improvements in top-1 accuracy across various subsets. This work
is expected to make a step towards human-level intelligence for DNN-based
models.

Abstract: Identifying quantum flakes is crucial for scalable quantum hardware; however,
automated layer classification from optical microscopy remains challenging due
to substantial appearance shifts across different materials. In this paper, we
propose a new Continual-Learning Framework for Flake Layer Classification
(CLIFF). To our knowledge, this is the first systematic study of continual
learning in the domain of two-dimensional (2D) materials. Our method enables
the model to differentiate between materials and their physical and optical
properties by freezing a backbone and base head trained on a reference
material. For each new material, it learns a material-specific prompt,
embedding, and a delta head. A prompt pool and a cosine-similarity gate
modulate features and compute material-specific corrections. Additionally, we
incorporate memory replay with knowledge distillation. CLIFF achieves
competitive accuracy with significantly lower forgetting than naive fine-tuning
and a prompt-based baseline.

TL;DR: 提出AdaGAT方法，通过动态调整引导模型的训练状态来提升目标模型的对抗鲁棒性，使用两个独立的损失函数使引导模型更积极参与反向传播。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的对抗蒸馏方法使用可学习的引导模型时，由于从零开始学习，难以在协同训练期间保持最佳状态进行有效的知识迁移。

Method: 开发AdaGAT方法，包含两个独立的损失函数，动态调整引导模型的训练状态，使其更积极地参与反向传播以达到最优状态。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和TinyImageNet数据集上的实验表明，在适当精度范围内调整引导模型能显著提升目标模型在各种对抗攻击下的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: AdaGAT方法通过自适应调整引导模型的训练状态，有效提升了轻量级学生模型的对抗鲁棒性，优于多种基线模型。

Abstract: Adversarial distillation (AD) is a knowledge distillation technique that
facilitates the transfer of robustness from teacher deep neural network (DNN)
models to lightweight target (student) DNN models, enabling the target models
to perform better than only training the student model independently. Some
previous works focus on using a small, learnable teacher (guide) model to
improve the robustness of a student model. Since a learnable guide model starts
learning from scratch, maintaining its optimal state for effective knowledge
transfer during co-training is challenging. Therefore, we propose a novel
Adaptive Guidance Adversarial Training (AdaGAT) method. Our method, AdaGAT,
dynamically adjusts the training state of the guide model to install robustness
to the target model. Specifically, we develop two separate loss functions as
part of the AdaGAT method, allowing the guide model to participate more
actively in backpropagation to achieve its optimal state. We evaluated our
approach via extensive experiments on three datasets: CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and
TinyImageNet, using the WideResNet-34-10 model as the target model. Our
observations reveal that appropriately adjusting the guide model within a
certain accuracy range enhances the target model's robustness across various
adversarial attacks compared to a variety of baseline models.

Conclusion: 提出的ST-HOID任务和相应方法有效解决了视频中时空人-物交互检测问题，并建立了首个评估数据集

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new instance-level human-object interaction
detection task on videos called ST-HOID, which aims to distinguish fine-grained
human-object interactions (HOIs) and the trajectories of subjects and objects.
It is motivated by the fact that HOI is crucial for human-centric video content
understanding. To solve ST-HOID, we propose a novel method consisting of an
object trajectory detection module and an interaction reasoning module.
Furthermore, we construct the first dataset named VidOR-HOID for ST-HOID
evaluation, which contains 10,831 spatial-temporal HOI instances. We conduct
extensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our method. The
experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the baselines
generated by the state-of-the-art methods of image human-object interaction
detection, video visual relation detection and video human-object interaction
recognition.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于深度学习的方法，自动化通过CT图像测量肌肉面积(SMA)来评估肌少症，提高识别效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肌少症与手术不良结果相关，但传统的SMA手工测量方法耗时耗力，限制了及旹识别和管理。人工智能技术可以提高这一过程的效率和可扩展性。

Method: 采用转移学习和自监督学习方法，利用标注和未标注的CT扫描数据集训练深度学习模型，自动测量肌肉面积(SMA)。

Result: 模型预测SMA的平均误差为±3%，预测分割掩码的平均Dice相似系数达到93%，显示出高准确性和可靠性。

Conclusion: 该研究为肌少症评估的全自动化提供了可行路径，采用定量SMA测量方法比定性评估更加准确且能够减轻数据不平衡问题。

Abstract: Sarcopenia is a progressive loss of muscle mass and function linked to poor
surgical outcomes such as prolonged hospital stays, impaired mobility, and
increased mortality. Although it can be assessed through cross-sectional
imaging by measuring skeletal muscle area (SMA), the process is time-consuming
and adds to clinical workloads, limiting timely detection and management;
however, this process could become more efficient and scalable with the
assistance of artificial intelligence applications. This paper presents
high-quality three-dimensional cross-sectional computed tomography (CT) images
of patients with sarcopenia collected at the Freeman Hospital, Newcastle upon
Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. Expert clinicians manually annotated the
SMA at the third lumbar vertebra, generating precise segmentation masks. We
develop deep-learning models to measure SMA in CT images and automate this
task. Our methodology employed transfer learning and self-supervised learning
approaches using labelled and unlabeled CT scan datasets. While we developed
qualitative assessment models for detecting sarcopenia, we observed that the
quantitative assessment of SMA is more precise and informative. This approach
also mitigates the issue of class imbalance and limited data availability. Our
model predicted the SMA, on average, with an error of +-3 percentage points
against the manually measured SMA. The average dice similarity coefficient of
the predicted masks was 93%. Our results, therefore, show a pathway to full
automation of sarcopenia assessment and detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 常规融合范式和固定跟踪模板限制了RGB-T跟踪中的特征交互，需要更有效的多模态表示学习方法。

Method: 使用模态感知网络（包含CADM和SSPM模块）提取模态特定线索，通过Transformer融合网络捕获全局依赖，设计三叉预测头和动态更新策略处理尺度变化和变形问题。

Result: 在三个RGB-T基准测试中达到满意结果，性能优于最先进方法，同时实现实时速度。

Conclusion: MTNet通过创新的模态感知和Transformer融合机制，有效提升了RGB-T跟踪的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: The ability to learn robust multi-modality representation has played a
critical role in the development of RGBT tracking. However, the regular fusion
paradigm and the invariable tracking template remain restrictive to the feature
interaction. In this paper, we propose a modality-aware tracker based on
transformer, termed MTNet. Specifically, a modality-aware network is presented
to explore modality-specific cues, which contains both channel aggregation and
distribution module(CADM) and spatial similarity perception module (SSPM). A
transformer fusion network is then applied to capture global dependencies to
reinforce instance representations. To estimate the precise location and tackle
the challenges, such as scale variation and deformation, we design a trident
prediction head and a dynamic update strategy which jointly maintain a reliable
template for facilitating inter-frame communication. Extensive experiments
validate that the proposed method achieves satisfactory results compared with
the state-of-the-art competitors on three RGBT benchmarks while reaching
real-time speed.

TL;DR: QTT-SEG是一个基于元学习的自动化方法，用于快速优化SAM模型在特定领域图像分割任务中的微调配置，在短时间内显著提升分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型如SAM在零样本图像分割方面表现优异，但在特定领域任务中表现不足。传统微调需要大量人工工作和领域专业知识，因此需要自动化方法来加速和优化微调过程。

Method: 基于Quick-Tune超参数优化框架，使用元学习的成本和性能模型来预测高性能配置，在超过2亿种可能性的搜索空间中高效导航。

Conclusion: 研究证明了元学习在自动化模型适应专门分割任务方面的巨大潜力，QTT-SEG为快速高效的模型微调提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Foundation models like SAM (Segment Anything Model) exhibit strong zero-shot
image segmentation performance, but often fall short on domain-specific tasks.
Fine-tuning these models typically requires significant manual effort and
domain expertise. In this work, we introduce QTT-SEG, a meta-learning-driven
approach for automating and accelerating the fine-tuning of SAM for image
segmentation. Built on the Quick-Tune hyperparameter optimization framework,
QTT-SEG predicts high-performing configurations using meta-learned cost and
performance models, efficiently navigating a search space of over 200 million
possibilities. We evaluate QTT-SEG on eight binary and five multiclass
segmentation datasets under tight time constraints. Our results show that
QTT-SEG consistently improves upon SAM's zero-shot performance and surpasses
AutoGluon Multimodal, a strong AutoML baseline, on most binary tasks within
three minutes. On multiclass datasets, QTT-SEG delivers consistent gains as
well. These findings highlight the promise of meta-learning in automating model
adaptation for specialized segmentation tasks. Code available at:

TL;DR: 本文是一篇关于组合式视觉推理的综合性综述，系统回顾了2023-2025年间260多篇论文，涵盖了该领域的发展历程、方法分类、基准测试和未来挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 组合式视觉推理作为多模态AI的关键研究方向，需要机器具备分解视觉场景、定位中间概念并进行多步逻辑推理的能力。现有综述主要关注单一视觉语言模型或通用多模态推理，缺乏对快速发展的组合式视觉推理文献的专门综合。

Method: 采用系统性文献综述方法，分析260+篇顶级会议论文，建立统一分类体系，追踪五个发展阶段的技术演进，并分类60+个基准测试和相应评估指标。

Result: 提出了组合式视觉推理的统一分类框架和历史发展路线图，识别了该领域的核心优势（认知对齐、语义保真度、鲁棒性等）和关键技术范式转变。

Conclusion: 该综述为组合式视觉推理研究提供了基础性参考，指出了当前挑战（如基于LLM的推理局限性、幻觉问题等），并展望了未来方向包括世界模型集成、人机协同推理和更丰富的评估协议。

Abstract: Compositional visual reasoning has emerged as a key research frontier in
multimodal AI, aiming to endow machines with the human-like ability to
decompose visual scenes, ground intermediate concepts, and perform multi-step
logical inference. While early surveys focus on monolithic vision-language
models or general multimodal reasoning, a dedicated synthesis of the rapidly
expanding compositional visual reasoning literature is still missing. We fill
this gap with a comprehensive survey spanning 2023 to 2025 that systematically
reviews 260+ papers from top venues (CVPR, ICCV, NeurIPS, ICML, ACL, etc.). We
first formalize core definitions and describe why compositional approaches
offer advantages in cognitive alignment, semantic fidelity, robustness,
interpretability, and data efficiency. Next, we trace a five-stage paradigm
shift: from prompt-enhanced language-centric pipelines, through tool-enhanced
LLMs and tool-enhanced VLMs, to recently minted chain-of-thought reasoning and
unified agentic VLMs, highlighting their architectural designs, strengths, and
limitations. We then catalog 60+ benchmarks and corresponding metrics that
probe compositional visual reasoning along dimensions such as grounding
accuracy, chain-of-thought faithfulness, and high-resolution perception.
Drawing on these analyses, we distill key insights, identify open challenges
(e.g., limitations of LLM-based reasoning, hallucination, a bias toward
deductive reasoning, scalable supervision, tool integration, and benchmark
limitations), and outline future directions, including world-model integration,
human-AI collaborative reasoning, and richer evaluation protocols. By offering
a unified taxonomy, historical roadmap, and critical outlook, this survey aims
to serve as a foundational reference and inspire the next generation of
compositional visual reasoning research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FoundDiff是一个基础扩散模型，通过两阶段策略（剂量-解剖感知和自适应去噪）实现跨不同剂量水平和解剖区域的统一低剂量CT去噪，在泛化性和性能上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于深度学习的低剂量CT去噪方法通常针对特定剂量水平和解剖区域训练，难以处理扫描条件变化时的噪声特征和解剖异质性，限制了在临床场景中的泛化性和鲁棒性。

Method: 采用两阶段策略：1）开发剂量-解剖感知对比学习模型（DA-CLIP）学习连续表示；2）设计剂量-解剖感知扩散模型（DA-Diff），通过基于Mamba的条件块整合学习到的嵌入信息进行自适应去噪。

Result: 在两个公共低剂量CT数据集上的实验表明，FoundDiff在八个剂量水平和三个解剖区域上表现出优越的去噪性能，并对未见过的剂量水平具有显著泛化能力。

Conclusion: FoundDiff提供了一个统一且可泛化的低剂量CT去噪解决方案，通过有效的剂量和解剖条件机制，在多样化临床场景中展现出强大的性能。

Abstract: Low-dose computed tomography (CT) denoising is crucial for reduced radiation
exposure while ensuring diagnostically acceptable image quality. Despite
significant advancements driven by deep learning (DL) in recent years, existing
DL-based methods, typically trained on a specific dose level and anatomical
region, struggle to handle diverse noise characteristics and anatomical
heterogeneity during varied scanning conditions, limiting their
generalizability and robustness in clinical scenarios. In this paper, we
propose FoundDiff, a foundational diffusion model for unified and generalizable
LDCT denoising across various dose levels and anatomical regions. FoundDiff
employs a two-stage strategy: (i) dose-anatomy perception and (ii) adaptive
denoising. First, we develop a dose- and anatomy-aware contrastive language
image pre-training model (DA-CLIP) to achieve robust dose and anatomy
perception by leveraging specialized contrastive learning strategies to learn
continuous representations that quantify ordinal dose variations and identify
salient anatomical regions. Second, we design a dose- and anatomy-aware
diffusion model (DA-Diff) to perform adaptive and generalizable denoising by
synergistically integrating the learned dose and anatomy embeddings from DACLIP
into diffusion process via a novel dose and anatomy conditional block (DACB)
based on Mamba. Extensive experiments on two public LDCT datasets encompassing
eight dose levels and three anatomical regions demonstrate superior denoising
performance of FoundDiff over existing state-of-the-art methods and the
remarkable generalization to unseen dose levels. The codes and models are
available at https://github.com/hao1635/FoundDiff.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成模型规模不断扩大，训练成本在内存和计算方面变得越来越高，需要开发无需训练且可扩展的图像编辑框架来实现定制化对象的插入。

Method: 提出位置嵌入移植技术，引导扩散模型忠实复制参考对象的结构特征；引入角点中心布局，将参考图像和背景图像拼接作为FLUX.1-Fill模型的输入；在渐进去噪过程中应用位置嵌入移植来指导目标区域的噪声分布。

Result: 大量实验表明，PosBridge在结构一致性、外观保真度和计算效率方面优于主流基线方法，展现了其实际价值和广泛应用潜力。

Conclusion: PosBridge是一个高效灵活的定制对象插入框架，通过位置嵌入移植和角点中心布局技术，实现了无需训练的高质量图像编辑，具有重要的实用价值。

Abstract: Localized subject-driven image editing aims to seamlessly integrate
user-specified objects into target scenes. As generative models continue to
scale, training becomes increasingly costly in terms of memory and computation,
highlighting the need for training-free and scalable editing frameworks.To this
end, we propose PosBridge an efficient and flexible framework for inserting
custom objects. A key component of our method is positional embedding
transplant, which guides the diffusion model to faithfully replicate the
structural characteristics of reference objects.Meanwhile, we introduce the
Corner Centered Layout, which concatenates reference images and the background
image as input to the FLUX.1-Fill model. During progressive denoising,
positional embedding transplant is applied to guide the noise distribution in
the target region toward that of the reference object. In this way, Corner
Centered Layout effectively directs the FLUX.1-Fill model to synthesize
identity-consistent content at the desired location. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that PosBridge outperforms mainstream baselines in structural
consistency, appearance fidelity, and computational efficiency, showcasing its
practical value and potential for broad adoption.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前分割技术已趋于成熟，单纯依靠技术改进难以在竞争中脱颖而出。通过可视化分析发现小麦茎部具有细粒度结构且像素占比少，存在预测脆弱和类别不平衡问题，需要针对小麦特性进行专门优化

Method: 1) 使用动态上采样器SAPA增强细节描绘；2) 采用半监督引导蒸馏结合茎感知样本选择挖掘未标注数据价值；3) 应用测试时缩放策略对图像进行两次放大分割

Result: 该方法在竞赛中获得第一名，明显超越第二名，证明了针对特定问题本质进行优化的有效性

Conclusion: 在分割技术成熟的背景下，针对具体问题特性（如小麦茎部）的专门优化比通用技术改进更具竞争力，简单但针对性的改进能够带来显著性能提升

Abstract: In this report, we present our solution during the participation of the MLCAS
2025 GWFSS Challenge. This challenge hosts a semantic segmentation competition
specific to wheat plants, which requires to segment three wheat organs
including the head, leaf, and stem, and another background class. In 2025,
participating a segmentation competition is significantly different from that
in previous years where many tricks can play important roles. Nowadays most
segmentation tricks have been well integrated into existing codebases such that
our naive ViT-Adapter baseline has already achieved sufficiently good
performance. Hence, we believe the key to stand out among other competitors is
to focus on the problem nature of wheat per se. By probing visualizations, we
identify the key -- the stem matters. In contrast to heads and leaves, stems
exhibit fine structure and occupy only few pixels, which suffers from fragile
predictions and class imbalance. Building on our baseline, we present three
technical improvements tailored to stems: i) incorporating a dynamic upsampler
SAPA used to enhance detail delineation; ii) leveraging semi-supervised guided
distillation with stem-aware sample selection to mine the treasure beneath
unlabeled data; and iii) applying a test-time scaling strategy to zoom in and
segment twice the image. Despite being simple, the three improvements bring us
to the first place of the competition, outperforming the second place by clear
margins. Code and models will be released at

Conclusion: 该方法为主动Deepfake检测提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案，通过纹理引导的扰动框架实现了良好的防御效果

Abstract: The rapid development of Deepfake technology poses severe challenges to
social trust and information security. While most existing detection methods
primarily rely on passive analyses, due to unresolvable high-quality Deepfake
contents, proactive defense has recently emerged by inserting invisible signals
in advance of image editing. In this paper, we introduce a proactive Deepfake
detection approach based on facial texture features. Since human eyes are more
sensitive to perturbations in smooth regions, we invisibly insert perturbations
within texture regions that have low perceptual saliency, applying localized
perturbations to key texture regions while minimizing unwanted noise in
non-textured areas. Our texture-guided perturbation framework first extracts
preliminary texture features via Local Binary Patterns (LBP), and then
introduces a dual-model attention strategy to generate and optimize texture
perturbations. Experiments on CelebA-HQ and LFW datasets demonstrate the
promising performance of our method in distorting Deepfake generation and
producing obvious visual defects under multiple attack models, providing an
efficient and scalable solution for proactive Deepfake detection.

Result: 准确从有限光谱数据重建光谱BRDF，在高光谱图像重建中超越现有方法，PSNR提升8dB

Conclusion: SpecGen方法有效解决了光谱BRDF数据稀缺问题，实现了高质量的光谱图像生成和渲染

Abstract: Synthesizing spectral images across different wavelengths is essential for
photorealistic rendering. Unlike conventional spectral uplifting methods that
convert RGB images into spectral ones, we introduce SpecGen, a novel method
that generates spectral bidirectional reflectance distribution functions
(BRDFs) from a single RGB image of a sphere. This enables spectral image
rendering under arbitrary illuminations and shapes covered by the corresponding
material. A key challenge in spectral BRDF generation is the scarcity of
measured spectral BRDF data. To address this, we propose the Spectral-Spatial
Tri-plane Aggregation (SSTA) network, which models reflectance responses across
wavelengths and incident-outgoing directions, allowing the training strategy to
leverage abundant RGB BRDF data to enhance spectral BRDF generation.
Experiments show that our method accurately reconstructs spectral BRDFs from
limited spectral data and surpasses state-of-the-art methods in hyperspectral
image reconstruction, achieving an improvement of 8 dB in PSNR. Codes and data
will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: We introduce MMCRICBENCH-3K, a benchmark for Visual Question Answering (VQA)
on cricket scorecards, designed to evaluate large vision-language models
(LVLMs) on complex numerical and cross-lingual reasoning over semi-structured
tabular images. MMCRICBENCH-3K comprises 1,463 synthetically generated

scorecards, and MMCRICBENCH-H-1.5K, containing visually similar Hindi
scorecards, with all questions and answers kept in English to enable controlled
cross-script evaluation. The task demands reasoning over structured numerical

show that even state-of-the-art LVLMs, such as GPT-4o and Qwen2.5VL, struggle
on the English subset despite it being their primary training language and
exhibit a further drop in performance on the Hindi subset. This reveals key
limitations in structure-aware visual text understanding, numerical reasoning,

Abstract: The rapid growth of high-resolution, meticulously crafted AI-generated images
poses a significant challenge to existing detection methods, which are often
trained and evaluated on low-resolution, automatically generated datasets that
do not align with the complexities of high-resolution scenarios. A common
practice is to resize or center-crop high-resolution images to fit standard
network inputs. However, without full coverage of all pixels, such strategies
risk either obscuring subtle, high-frequency artifacts or discarding
information from uncovered regions, leading to input information loss. In this
paper, we introduce the High-Resolution Detail-Aggregation Network (HiDA-Net),
a novel framework that ensures no pixel is left behind. We use the Feature
Aggregation Module (FAM), which fuses features from multiple full-resolution
local tiles with a down-sampled global view of the image. These local features
are aggregated and fused with global representations for final prediction,
ensuring that native-resolution details are preserved and utilized for
detection. To enhance robustness against challenges such as localized AI
manipulations and compression, we introduce Token-wise Forgery Localization
(TFL) module for fine-grained spatial sensitivity and JPEG Quality Factor
Estimation (QFE) module to disentangle generative artifacts from compression
noise explicitly. Furthermore, to facilitate future research, we introduce
HiRes-50K, a new challenging benchmark consisting of 50,568 images with up to
64 megapixels. Extensive experiments show that HiDA-Net achieves
state-of-the-art, increasing accuracy by over 13% on the challenging Chameleon
dataset and 10% on our HiRes-50K.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiCache是一种无需训练的自适应缓存策略，通过浅层在线探针实时分析特征差异模式，动态确定缓存时机和组合方式，显著提升扩散模型加速效果和视觉质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于缓存的扩散模型加速方法依赖预定义经验法则或数据集级先验，在动态扩散过程中泛化性有限，对异常样本效果不佳。研究发现浅层特征差异模式与最终输出变化存在强相关性，不同层特征形成相似轨迹。

Method: DiCache包含两个核心组件：1)在线探针分析方案，利用浅层在线探针实时获取缓存误差稳定先验，自主确定缓存时机；2)动态缓存轨迹对齐，基于浅层探针特征轨迹组合多步缓存，更好近似当前特征。

Result: 在多种领先扩散模型（WAN 2.1、HunyuanVideo视频生成、Flux图像生成）上的大量实验验证了DiCache在实现更高效率和改进视觉保真度方面优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: DiCache提供了一个统一的框架来解决何时缓存和如何使用缓存的问题，通过利用浅层特征模式的相关性和轨迹相似性，实现了无需训练的自适应加速策略，在多个扩散模型上表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the rapid development of acceleration techniques
for diffusion models, especially caching-based acceleration methods. These
studies seek to answer two fundamental questions: "When to cache" and "How to
use cache", typically relying on predefined empirical laws or dataset-level
priors to determine the timing of caching and utilizing handcrafted rules for
leveraging multi-step caches. However, given the highly dynamic nature of the
diffusion process, they often exhibit limited generalizability and fail on
outlier samples. In this paper, a strong correlation is revealed between the
variation patterns of the shallow-layer feature differences in the diffusion
model and those of final model outputs. Moreover, we have observed that the
features from different model layers form similar trajectories. Based on these
observations, we present DiCache, a novel training-free adaptive caching
strategy for accelerating diffusion models at runtime, answering both when and
how to cache within a unified framework. Specifically, DiCache is composed of
two principal components: (1) Online Probe Profiling Scheme leverages a
shallow-layer online probe to obtain a stable prior for the caching error in
real time, enabling the model to autonomously determine caching schedules. (2)
Dynamic Cache Trajectory Alignment combines multi-step caches based on
shallow-layer probe feature trajectory to better approximate the current
feature, facilitating higher visual quality. Extensive experiments validate
DiCache's capability in achieving higher efficiency and improved visual
fidelity over state-of-the-art methods on various leading diffusion models
including WAN 2.1, HunyuanVideo for video generation, and Flux for image
generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法为每种条件类型训练独立控制分支，导致模型结构冗余和计算资源低效使用，需要统一的框架来支持多样化条件输入并提高生成效率。

Method: 提出Condition Modulated Expert (CoMoE)模块聚合语义相似的补丁特征并分配给专家模块，以及WeaveNet动态连接机制实现主干网络和控制分支的有效交互。

Result: 在Subjects-200K和MultiGen-20M数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法在各种条件图像生成任务中始终达到最先进的性能。

Conclusion: UniGen框架通过创新的CoMoE和WeaveNet设计，有效解决了多条件图像生成中的特征纠缠和计算冗余问题，证明了其在多功能性和有效性方面的优势。

Abstract: The image-to-image generation task aims to produce controllable images by
leveraging conditional inputs and prompt instructions. However, existing
methods often train separate control branches for each type of condition,
leading to redundant model structures and inefficient use of computational
resources. To address this, we propose a Unified image-to-image Generation
(UniGen) framework that supports diverse conditional inputs while enhancing
generation efficiency and expressiveness. Specifically, to tackle the widely
existing parameter redundancy and computational inefficiency in controllable
conditional generation architectures, we propose the Condition Modulated Expert
(CoMoE) module. This module aggregates semantically similar patch features and
assigns them to dedicated expert modules for visual representation and
conditional modeling. By enabling independent modeling of foreground features
under different conditions, CoMoE effectively mitigates feature entanglement
and redundant computation in multi-condition scenarios. Furthermore, to bridge
the information gap between the backbone and control branches, we propose
WeaveNet, a dynamic, snake-like connection mechanism that enables effective
interaction between global text-level control from the backbone and
fine-grained control from conditional branches. Extensive experiments on the
Subjects-200K and MultiGen-20M datasets across various conditional image
generation tasks demonstrate that our method consistently achieves
state-of-the-art performance, validating its advantages in both versatility and
effectiveness. The code has been uploaded to

*Nir Mazor,Tom Hope*

TL;DR: 开发了一个联合优化多模态检索器和LVLM的医疗诊断模型，相比标准RAG能显著提升困难病例的诊断性能，但仍有很大的性能提升空间


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床决策需要解读医学图像进行诊断，从医学文献和医院记录中检索相关视觉信息可以提高诊断准确性

Method: 联合优化多模态检索器和大型视觉语言模型(LVLM)，将LVLM的错误信号传播到检索器，仅使用通用骨干网络进行轻量级微调

Result: 在临床多标签分类和视觉问答任务上达到与医学预训练模型竞争的结果，联合检索优化显著改善了标准RAG在困难病例上的表现

Conclusion: 虽然正确诊断经常可以通过检索到的图像实现，但实际性能与理论上限仍有很大差距，前沿LVLM重新排序器也无法弥合这一差距，为未来方法留下了充足的改进空间

Abstract: Clinical decision-making often involves interpreting images (e.g., radiology)
for making diagnoses. Retrieving relevant visual information from medical
literature and hospital records could enhance diagnostic accuracy. In this
paper, we develop a model in which a multimodal retriever is jointly optimized
with an LVLM for medical diagnosis, unlike standard RAG where LVLM error signal
is not propagated down to the retriever. We show that using only
general-purpose backbones, with only lightweight fine-tuning, our model is able
to achieve competitive results with medically-pretrained models across clinical
multi-label classification and visual question answering tasks. In a novel
analysis, we additionally find that in many cases different top retrieved
images each lead to different predictions for a given target, and that these
cases are empirically challenging for all models, even for non-retrieval
models. Our joint retrieval optimization significantly improves these
challenging cases over standard RAG. However, oracle analysis reveals that
while the correct diagnosis is frequently achievable using one of the top
retrieved images, in practice there is a large performance gap from the oracle,
and rerankers using frontier LVLMs do not close this gap -- leaving ample room
for improvement by future methods. Code will be made publicly available.

Conclusion: MoCo通过解耦结构和外观生成，有效解决了人体视频生成中的运动一致性和结构连贯性问题，为复杂全身运动生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Generating human videos with consistent motion from text prompts remains a
significant challenge, particularly for whole-body or long-range motion.
Existing video generation models prioritize appearance fidelity, resulting in
unrealistic or physically implausible human movements with poor structural
coherence. Additionally, most existing human video datasets primarily focus on
facial or upper-body motions, or consist of vertically oriented dance videos,
limiting the scope of corresponding generation methods to simple movements. To
overcome these challenges, we propose MoCo, which decouples the process of
human video generation into two components: structure generation and appearance
generation. Specifically, our method first employs an efficient 3D structure
generator to produce a human motion sequence from a text prompt. The remaining
video appearance is then synthesized under the guidance of the generated
structural sequence. To improve fine-grained control over sparse human
structures, we introduce Human-Aware Dynamic Control modules and integrate
dense tracking constraints during training. Furthermore, recognizing the
limitations of existing datasets, we construct a large-scale whole-body human
video dataset featuring complex and diverse motions. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that MoCo outperforms existing approaches in generating realistic
and structurally coherent human videos.

TL;DR: E-BayesSAM是一个高效的贝叶斯SAM框架，通过Token-wise变分贝叶斯推理和无训练不确定性估计，以及自优化KAN网络提高可解释性，在医学图像分割中实现了实时推理、更高精度和更好的可解释性。

Conclusion: E-BayesSAM统一了效率、可靠性和可解释性，将SAM的通用性与临床需求相结合，推动了在安全关键医疗应用中的部署。

Abstract: Although the Segment Anything Model (SAM) has advanced medical image
segmentation, its Bayesian adaptation for uncertainty-aware segmentation
remains hindered by three key issues: (1) instability in Bayesian fine-tuning
of large pre-trained SAMs; (2) high computation cost due to SAM's massive
parameters; (3) SAM's black-box design limits interpretability. To overcome
these, we propose E-BayesSAM, an efficient framework combining Token-wise
Variational Bayesian Inference (T-VBI) for efficienty Bayesian adaptation and
Self-Optimizing Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (SO-KAN) for improving
interpretability. T-VBI innovatively reinterprets SAM's output tokens as
dynamic probabilistic weights and reparameterizes them as latent variables
without auxiliary training, enabling training-free VBI for uncertainty
estimation. SO-KAN improves token prediction with learnable spline activations
via self-supervised learning, providing insight to prune redundant tokens to
boost efficiency and accuracy. Experiments on five ultrasound datasets
demonstrated that E-BayesSAM achieves: (i) real-time inference (0.03s/image),
(ii) superior segmentation accuracy (average DSC: Pruned E-BayesSAM's 89.0\%
vs. E-BayesSAM's 88.0% vs. MedSAM's 88.3%), and (iii) identification of four
critical tokens governing SAM's decisions. By unifying efficiency, reliability,
and interpretability, E-BayesSAM bridges SAM's versatility with clinical needs,
advancing deployment in safety-critical medical applications. The source code

Abstract: We analyze data leakage in visual datasets. Data leakage refers to images in
evaluation benchmarks that have been seen during training, compromising fair

characterize visual leakage into different types according to its modality,
coverage, and degree. By applying image retrieval techniques, we unequivocally
show that all the analyzed datasets present some form of leakage, and that all
types of leakage, from severe instances to more subtle cases, compromise the
reliability of model evaluation in downstream tasks.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) pre-trained on web-scale data exhibit promising
zero-shot generalization but often suffer from semantic misalignment due to
domain gaps between pre-training and downstream tasks. Existing approaches
primarily focus on text prompting with class-specific descriptions and
visual-text adaptation via aligning cropped image regions with textual
descriptions. However, they still face the issues of incomplete textual prompts
and noisy visual prompts. In this paper, we propose a novel constrained prompt
enhancement (CPE) method to improve visual-textual alignment by constructing
comprehensive textual prompts and compact visual prompts from the semantic
perspective. Specifically, our approach consists of two key components:
Topology-Guided Synonymous Semantic Generation (TGSSG) and Category-Agnostic
Discriminative Region Selection (CADRS). Textually, to address the issue of
incomplete semantic expression in textual prompts, our TGSSG first generates
synonymous semantic set for each category via large language models, and
constructs comprehensive textual prompts based on semantic ambiguity entropy
and persistent homology analysis. Visually, to mitigate the irrelevant visual
noise introduced by random cropping, our CADRS identifies discriminative
regions with activation maps outputted by a pre-trained vision model,
effectively filtering out noisy regions and generating compact visual prompts.
Given the comprehensive set of textual prompts and compact set of visual
prompts, we introduce two set-to-set matching strategies based on test-time
adaptation (TTA) and optimal transport (OT) to achieve effective visual-textual
alignment, and so improve zero-shot generalization of VLMs.

Abstract: Person re-identification (Re-ID) is a fundamental task in intelligent
surveillance and public safety. Federated learning (FL) offers a
privacy-preserving solution by enabling collaborative model training without
centralized data collection. However, applying FL to real-world re-ID systems
faces two major challenges: statistical heterogeneity across clients due to
non-IID data distributions, and substantial communication overhead caused by
frequent transmission of large-scale models. To address these issues, we
propose FedKLPR, a lightweight and communication-efficient federated learning
framework for person re-identification. FedKLPR introduces four key components.
First, the KL-Divergence Regularization Loss (KLL) constrains local models by
minimizing the divergence from the global feature distribution, effectively
mitigating the effects of statistical heterogeneity and improving convergence
stability under non-IID conditions. Secondly, KL-Divergence-Prune Weighted
Aggregation (KLPWA) integrates pruning ratio and distributional similarity into
the aggregation process, thereby improving the robustness of the global model
while significantly reducing communication overhead. Furthermore, sparse
Activation Skipping (SAS) mitigates the dilution of critical parameters during
the aggregation of pruned client models by excluding zero-valued weights from
the update process. Finally, Cross-Round Recovery (CRR) introduces a dynamic
pruning control mechanism that halts pruning when necessary, enabling deeper
compression while maintaining model accuracy. Experimental results on eight
benchmark datasets demonstrate that FedKLPR achieves significant communication
reduction. Compared with the state-of-the-art, FedKLPR reduces 33\%-38\%
communication cost on ResNet-50 and 20\%-40\% communication cost on ResNet-34,
while maintaining model accuracy within 1\% degradation.

Conclusion: TinySR证明了在保持感知质量的前提下，通过精心设计的压缩和优化策略，可以实现实时性能的图像超分辨率扩散模型。

Abstract: Real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) focuses on recovering
high-quality images from low-resolution inputs that suffer from complex
degradations like noise, blur, and compression. Recently, diffusion models
(DMs) have shown great potential in this area by leveraging strong generative
priors to restore fine details. However, their iterative denoising process
incurs high computational overhead, posing challenges for real-time
applications. Although one-step distillation methods, such as OSEDiff and
TSD-SR, offer faster inference, they remain fundamentally constrained by their
large, over-parameterized model architectures. In this work, we present TinySR,
a compact yet effective diffusion model specifically designed for Real-ISR that
achieves real-time performance while maintaining perceptual quality. We
introduce a Dynamic Inter-block Activation and an Expansion-Corrosion Strategy
to facilitate more effective decision-making in depth pruning. We achieve VAE
compression through channel pruning, attention removal and lightweight SepConv.
We eliminate time- and prompt-related modules and perform pre-caching
techniques to further speed up the model. TinySR significantly reduces
computational cost and model size, achieving up to 5.68x speedup and 83%
parameter reduction compared to its teacher TSD-SR, while still providing high
quality results.

Conclusion: RefineEdit-Agent通过智能代理设计在编辑保真度和上下文保持方面表现出色，消融研究、人工评估和分析验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable capabilities of text-to-image (T2I) generation models,
real-world applications often demand fine-grained, iterative image editing that
existing methods struggle to provide. Key challenges include granular
instruction understanding, robust context preservation during modifications,
and the lack of intelligent feedback mechanisms for iterative refinement. This
paper introduces RefineEdit-Agent, a novel, training-free intelligent agent
framework designed to address these limitations by enabling complex, iterative,
and context-aware image editing. RefineEdit-Agent leverages the powerful
planning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the advanced visual
understanding and evaluation prowess of Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs)
within a closed-loop system. Our framework comprises an LVLM-driven instruction
parser and scene understanding module, a multi-level LLM-driven editing planner
for goal decomposition, tool selection, and sequence generation, an iterative
image editing module, and a crucial LVLM-driven feedback and evaluation loop.
To rigorously evaluate RefineEdit-Agent, we propose LongBench-T2I-Edit, a new
benchmark featuring 500 initial images with complex, multi-turn editing
instructions across nine visual dimensions. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that RefineEdit-Agent significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines,
achieving an average score of 3.67 on LongBench-T2I-Edit, compared to 2.29 for
Direct Re-Prompting, 2.91 for InstructPix2Pix, 3.16 for GLIGEN-based Edit, and
3.39 for ControlNet-XL. Ablation studies, human evaluations, and analyses of
iterative refinement, backbone choices, tool usage, and robustness to
instruction complexity further validate the efficacy of our agentic design in
delivering superior edit fidelity and context preservation.

Abstract: This paper addresses the limitations of neural rendering-based multi-view
surface reconstruction methods, which require an additional mesh extraction
step that is inconvenient and would produce poor-quality surfaces with mesh
aliasing, restricting downstream applications. Building on the explicit mesh
representation and differentiable rasterization framework, this work proposes
an efficient solution that preserves the high efficiency of this framework
while significantly improving reconstruction quality and versatility.
Specifically, we introduce a disentangled geometry and appearance model that
does not rely on deep networks, enhancing learning and broadening
applicability. A neural deformation field is constructed to incorporate global
geometric context, enhancing geometry learning, while a novel regularization
constrains geometric features passed to a neural shader to ensure its accuracy
and boost shading. For appearance, a view-invariant diffuse term is separated
and baked into mesh vertices, further improving rendering efficiency.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art training (4.84 minutes) and rendering (0.023 seconds) speeds,
with reconstruction quality that is competitive with top-performing methods.
Moreover, the method enables practical applications such as mesh and texture
editing, showcasing its versatility and application potential. This combination
of efficiency, competitive quality, and broad applicability makes our approach
a valuable contribution to multi-view surface reconstruction and rendering.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从视觉信息推断3D场景物理属性是创建交互式虚拟世界的关键挑战，现有方法依赖缓慢的逐场景优化，限制了通用性和应用

Abstract: Inferring the physical properties of 3D scenes from visual information is a
critical yet challenging task for creating interactive and realistic virtual
worlds. While humans intuitively grasp material characteristics such as
elasticity or stiffness, existing methods often rely on slow, per-scene
optimization, limiting their generalizability and application. To address this
problem, we introduce PIXIE, a novel method that trains a generalizable neural
network to predict physical properties across multiple scenes from 3D visual
features purely using supervised losses. Once trained, our feed-forward network
can perform fast inference of plausible material fields, which coupled with a
learned static scene representation like Gaussian Splatting enables realistic
physics simulation under external forces. To facilitate this research, we also
collected PIXIEVERSE, one of the largest known datasets of paired 3D assets and
physic material annotations. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that PIXIE is
about 1.46-4.39x better and orders of magnitude faster than test-time
optimization methods. By leveraging pretrained visual features like CLIP, our
method can also zero-shot generalize to real-world scenes despite only ever
been trained on synthetic data. https://pixie-3d.github.io/

Conclusion: 该研究为未来开发具有更强跨域泛化能力的3D目标检测器提供了重要基准和指导，推动了室内场景理解技术的发展。

Abstract: As a fundamental task for indoor scene understanding, 3D object detection has
been extensively studied, and the accuracy on indoor point cloud data has been
substantially improved. However, existing researches have been conducted on
limited datasets, where the training and testing sets share the same
distribution. In this paper, we consider the task of adapting indoor 3D object
detectors from one dataset to another, presenting a comprehensive benchmark
with ScanNet, SUN RGB-D and 3D Front datasets, as well as our newly proposed
large-scale datasets ProcTHOR-OD and ProcFront generated by a 3D simulator.
Since indoor point cloud datasets are collected and constructed in different
ways, the object detectors are likely to overfit to specific factors within
each dataset, such as point cloud quality, bounding box layout and instance
features. We conduct experiments across datasets on different adaptation
scenarios including synthetic-to-real adaptation, point cloud quality
adaptation, layout adaptation and instance feature adaptation, analyzing the
impact of different domain gaps on 3D object detectors. We also introduce
several approaches to improve adaptation performances, providing baselines for
domain adaptive indoor 3D object detection, hoping that future works may
propose detectors with stronger generalization ability across domains. Our

### [108] [Multi-Level LVLM Guidance for Untrimmed Video Action Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17442)
*Liyang Peng,Sihan Zhu,Yunjie Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ECVT是一种新颖的双分支视频Transformer架构，利用大型视觉语言模型生成多粒度语义描述，通过跨模态融合机制显著提升复杂未修剪视频中的动作识别和定位性能，在多个基准数据集上达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在复杂未修剪视频中难以捕捉细粒度动作、长期时间依赖和从低级视觉特征提取高级语义信息的局限性。

Method: 采用双分支设计：视频编码分支用于时空特征提取，跨模态引导分支利用LVLM生成全局事件提示和时间子事件提示等多粒度语义描述，通过自适应门控、跨模态注意力和事件图模块进行融合。

Result: 在ActivityNet v1.3上达到40.5%的平均mAP，在THUMOS14上达到67.1%的mAP@0.5，显著超越现有基线方法。

Conclusion: ECVT通过有效整合视觉语言模型的语义理解能力，成功提升了视频时序结构和事件逻辑的理解能力，为复杂视频分析提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Action recognition and localization in complex, untrimmed videos remain a
formidable challenge in computer vision, largely due to the limitations of
existing methods in capturing fine-grained actions, long-term temporal
dependencies, and high-level semantic information from low-level visual
features. This paper introduces the Event-Contextualized Video Transformer
(ECVT), a novel architecture that leverages the advanced semantic understanding
capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to bridge this gap. ECVT
employs a dual-branch design, comprising a Video Encoding Branch for
spatio-temporal feature extraction and a Cross-Modal Guidance Branch. The
latter utilizes an LVLM to generate multi-granularity semantic descriptions,
including Global Event Prompting for macro-level narrative and Temporal
Sub-event Prompting for fine-grained action details. These multi-level textual
cues are integrated into the video encoder's learning process through
sophisticated mechanisms such as adaptive gating for high-level semantic
fusion, cross-modal attention for fine-grained feature refinement, and an event
graph module for temporal context calibration. Trained end-to-end with a
comprehensive loss function incorporating semantic consistency and temporal
calibration terms, ECVT significantly enhances the model's ability to
understand video temporal structures and event logic. Extensive experiments on
ActivityNet v1.3 and THUMOS14 datasets demonstrate that ECVT achieves
state-of-the-art performance, with an average mAP of 40.5% on ActivityNet v1.3
and mAP@0.5 of 67.1% on THUMOS14, outperforming leading baselines.

Abstract: In the field of multimodal medical data analysis, leveraging diverse types of
data and understanding their hidden relationships continues to be a research
focus. The main challenges lie in effectively modeling the complex interactions
between heterogeneous data modalities with distinct characteristics while
capturing both local and global dependencies across modalities. To address
these challenges, this paper presents a two-stage multimodal prognosis model,
GraphMMP, which is based on graph neural networks. The proposed model
constructs feature graphs using mutual information and features a global fusion
module built on Mamba, which significantly boosts prognosis performance.
Empirical results show that GraphMMP surpasses existing methods on datasets
related to liver prognosis and the METABRIC study, demonstrating its
effectiveness in multimodal medical prognosis tasks.

Motivation: 现有微调范式在过度自由和过度限制之间摇摆，导致多模态跟踪器的可塑性-稳定性权衡不佳，需要更精细的调优方法

Method: 首先分析预训练权重的切空间来测量先验敏感度以保持泛化性，然后在调优阶段探索迁移敏感度以强调适应性和稳定性，将这些敏感度作为正则化项融入学习过程

Result: 该方法显著增强了跨模态的可迁移性，在各种多模态跟踪任务中超越了当前最先进技术

Conclusion: 提出的敏感度感知正则化调优框架有效解决了多模态跟踪器的优化挑战，通过精细的参数敏感度分析实现了更好的性能表现

Abstract: This paper tackles the critical challenge of optimizing multi-modal trackers
by effectively adapting the pre-trained models for RGB data. Existing
fine-tuning paradigms oscillate between excessive freedom and over-restriction,
both leading to a suboptimal plasticity-stability trade-off. To mitigate this
dilemma, we propose a novel sensitivity-aware regularized tuning framework,
which delicately refines the learning process by incorporating intrinsic
parameter sensitivities. Through a comprehensive investigation from pre-trained
to multi-modal contexts, we identify that parameters sensitive to pivotal
foundational patterns and cross-domain shifts are primary drivers of this
issue. Specifically, we first analyze the tangent space of pre-trained weights
to measure and orient prior sensitivities, dedicated to preserving
generalization. Then, we further explore transfer sensitivities during the
tuning phase, emphasizing adaptability and stability. By incorporating these
sensitivities as regularization terms, our method significantly enhances the
transferability across modalities. Extensive experiments showcase the superior
performance of the proposed method, surpassing current state-of-the-art
techniques across various multi-modal tracking. The source code and models will
be publicly available at https://github.com/zhiwen-xdu/SRTrack.

Abstract: Human social behaviors are inherently multimodal necessitating the
development of powerful audiovisual models for their perception. In this paper,
we present Social-MAE, our pre-trained audiovisual Masked Autoencoder based on
an extended version of Contrastive Audio-Visual Masked Auto-Encoder (CAV-MAE),
which is pre-trained on audiovisual social data. Specifically, we modify
CAV-MAE to receive a larger number of frames as input and pre-train it on a
large dataset of human social interaction (VoxCeleb2) in a self-supervised
manner. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this model by finetuning and
evaluating the model on different social and affective downstream tasks,
namely, emotion recognition, laughter detection and apparent personality
estimation. The model achieves state-of-the-art results on multimodal emotion
recognition and laughter recognition and competitive results for apparent

*Michael Podsiadly,Brendon K Lay*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 结合DINO和Barlow Twins两种自监督学习方法的优势，提出了一种在有限标注数据和计算资源下训练视觉Transformer的新方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自监督学习中DINO对数据增强敏感和Barlow Twins需要大批次训练的问题，利用两种方法的互补优势来降低对标注数据和计算资源的需求。

Method: 将Barlow Twins的冗余减少目标与DINO的自蒸馏策略相结合，在MS COCO数据集上使用仅10%的标注数据进行线性探测训练。

Result: 混合方法在损失和分类准确率方面与DINO相当，同时保持了强大的特征表示能力，注意力可视化显示在语义分割能力方面有所提升。

Conclusion: 该方法为资源受限环境下训练ViT提供了一种可扩展、标签高效的替代方案。

Abstract: Training AI models to understand images without costly labeled data remains a
challenge. We combine two techniques--DINO (teacher-student learning) and
Barlow Twins (redundancy reduction)--to create a model that learns better with
fewer labels and less compute. While both DINO and Barlow Twins have
independently demonstrated strong performance in self-supervised learning, each
comes with limitations--DINO may be sensitive to certain augmentations, and
Barlow Twins often requires batch sizes too large to fit on consumer hardware.
By combining the redundancy-reduction objective of Barlow Twins with the
self-distillation strategy of DINO, we aim to leverage their complementary
strengths. We train a hybrid model on the MS COCO dataset using only 10\% of
labeled data for linear probing, and evaluate its performance against
standalone DINO and Barlow Twins implementations. Preliminary results show that
the combined approach achieves comparable loss and classification accuracy to
DINO while maintaining strong feature representations. Attention visualizations
further suggest improved semantic segmentation capability in the hybrid model.
This combined method offers a scalable, label-efficient alternative for
training ViTs in resource-constrained environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniMRI是一个统一的视觉-语言基础模型，旨在整合MRI工作流程中的多个任务，包括重建、分割、检测、诊断和报告生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前MRI工作流程分散且缺乏通用性，现有方法通常是针对特定解剖结构或应用的，缺乏跨临床环境的泛化能力，且很少整合影像数据和语言信息。

Method: 采用多阶段训练范式：自监督视觉预训练、视觉-语言对齐、多模态预训练和多任务指令调优。使用来自60个公共数据集的大规模异质语料库进行训练，包含超过22万MRI体积和1900万MRI切片。

Result: 定性结果表明OmniMRI能够在单一架构中执行多样化任务，包括MRI重建、解剖和病理分割、异常检测、诊断建议和放射学报告生成。

Conclusion: OmniMRI有潜力将分散的流程整合为可扩展的通用框架，为统一成像和临床语言的综合端到端MRI解释奠定了基础模型的发展方向。

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is indispensable in clinical practice but
remains constrained by fragmented, multi-stage workflows encompassing
acquisition, reconstruction, segmentation, detection, diagnosis, and reporting.
While deep learning has achieved progress in individual tasks, existing
approaches are often anatomy- or application-specific and lack generalizability
across diverse clinical settings. Moreover, current pipelines rarely integrate
imaging data with complementary language information that radiologists rely on
in routine practice. Here, we introduce OmniMRI, a unified vision-language
foundation model designed to generalize across the entire MRI workflow. OmniMRI
is trained on a large-scale, heterogeneous corpus curated from 60 public
datasets, over 220,000 MRI volumes and 19 million MRI slices, incorporating
image-only data, paired vision-text data, and instruction-response data. Its
multi-stage training paradigm, comprising self-supervised vision pretraining,
vision-language alignment, multimodal pretraining, and multi-task instruction
tuning, progressively equips the model with transferable visual
representations, cross-modal reasoning, and robust instruction-following
capabilities. Qualitative results demonstrate OmniMRI's ability to perform
diverse tasks within a single architecture, including MRI reconstruction,
anatomical and pathological segmentation, abnormality detection, diagnostic
suggestion, and radiology report generation. These findings highlight OmniMRI's
potential to consolidate fragmented pipelines into a scalable, generalist
framework, paving the way toward foundation models that unify imaging and
clinical language for comprehensive, end-to-end MRI interpretation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学影像数据稀缺限制了从头训练模型的效能，迁移学习成为关键解决方案。研究旨在确定最优CNN架构并比较不同预训练策略的效果。

Method: 使用1维卷积分类器、ResNet50预训练骨干网络和部分骨干网络解冻策略，在乳腺病变恶性检测和ACL撕裂检测任务上进行实验。

Result: 最佳模型在ACL撕裂检测上达到0.9969 AUC，在乳腺结节恶性检测上达到0.9641 AUC，性能与Mei等人结果相当并超越其他先前工作。未发现RadImageNet预训练在这两个任务上优于ImageNet预训练的证据。

Conclusion: 研究确定了最优的CNN架构配置，但发现RadImageNet预训练在特定医学影像分类任务上并不总是优于ImageNet预训练。

Abstract: Modern computer vision models have proven to be highly useful for medical
imaging classification and segmentation tasks, but the scarcity of medical
imaging data often limits the efficacy of models trained from scratch. Transfer
learning has emerged as a pivotal solution to this, enabling the fine-tuning of
high-performance models on small data. Mei et al. (2022) found that
pre-training CNNs on a large dataset of radiologist-labeled images
(RadImageNet) enhanced model performance on downstream tasks compared to
ImageNet pretraining. The present work extends Mei et al. (2022) by conducting
a comprehensive investigation to determine optimal CNN architectures for breast
lesion malignancy detection and ACL tear detection, as well as performing
statistical analysis to compare the effect of RadImageNet and ImageNet
pre-training on downstream model performance. Our findings suggest that
1-dimensional convolutional classifiers with skip connections, ResNet50
pre-trained backbones, and partial backbone unfreezing yields optimal
downstream medical classification performance. Our best models achieve AUCs of
0.9969 for ACL tear detection and 0.9641 for breast nodule malignancy
detection, competitive with the results reported by Mei et al. (2022) and
surpassing other previous works. We do not find evidence confirming RadImageNet
pre-training to provide superior downstream performance for ACL tear and breast
lesion classification tasks.

Motivation: 超材料的设计面临几何结构复杂和结构-性能映射关系非线性的挑战，需要系统化的设计工具和基准测试方法。

Method: 开发了MetaDSL领域特定语言来描述超材料设计，构建了包含15万+参数化程序的MetaDB数据库，并建立了MetaBench基准测试套件来评估视觉-语言模型的能力。

Conclusion: 该框架为集成化设计和理解结构-表示-性能关系提供了重要基础，是超材料设计领域的重要进展。

Abstract: Metamaterials are micro-architected structures whose geometry imparts highly
tunable-often counter-intuitive-bulk properties. Yet their design is difficult
because of geometric complexity and a non-trivial mapping from architecture to
behaviour. We address these challenges with three complementary contributions.
(i) MetaDSL: a compact, semantically rich domain-specific language that
captures diverse metamaterial designs in a form that is both human-readable and
machine-parsable. (ii) MetaDB: a curated repository of more than 150,000
parameterized MetaDSL programs together with their
derivatives-three-dimensional geometry, multi-view renderings, and simulated
elastic properties. (iii) MetaBench: benchmark suites that test three core
capabilities of vision-language metamaterial assistants-structure
reconstruction, property-driven inverse design, and performance prediction. We
establish baselines by fine-tuning state-of-the-art vision-language models and
deploy an omni-model within an interactive, CAD-like interface. Case studies
show that our framework provides a strong first step toward integrated design
and understanding of structure-representation-property relationships.

Result: 实验证明IDU流水线显著减少更新时间和人工成本，为快速演变的军事场景提供经济高效的解决方案

Conclusion: IDU管道提供了一种针对性强、成本效益高的方法，能够有效维护军事3D模型的时效性

Abstract: For simulation and training purposes, military organizations have made
substantial investments in developing high-resolution 3D virtual environments
through extensive imaging and 3D scanning. However, the dynamic nature of
battlefield conditions-where objects may appear or vanish over time-makes
frequent full-scale updates both time-consuming and costly. In response, we
introduce the Incremental Dynamic Update (IDU) pipeline, which efficiently
updates existing 3D reconstructions, such as 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), with
only a small set of newly acquired images. Our approach starts with camera pose
estimation to align new images with the existing 3D model, followed by change
detection to pinpoint modifications in the scene. A 3D generative AI model is
then used to create high-quality 3D assets of the new elements, which are
seamlessly integrated into the existing 3D model. The IDU pipeline incorporates
human guidance to ensure high accuracy in object identification and placement,
with each update focusing on a single new object at a time. Experimental
results confirm that our proposed IDU pipeline significantly reduces update
time and labor, offering a cost-effective and targeted solution for maintaining
up-to-date 3D models in rapidly evolving military scenarios.

Motivation: 生成式世界模型由于扩散模型的迭代特性导致推理速度慢，现有加速技术直接应用于世界模型会导致质量下降

Method: 分层加速策略：浅层使用补丁刷新机制选择需要重新计算的token；深层使用线性外推方案直接估计中间特征，绕过注意力模块和前馈网络计算

Result: 实验显示HERO实现了1.73倍加速，质量退化最小，显著优于现有扩散加速方法

Conclusion: HERO框架有效解决了世界模型推理效率问题，通过利用特征耦合现象实现高质量加速

Abstract: Generation-driven world models create immersive virtual environments but
suffer slow inference due to the iterative nature of diffusion models. While
recent advances have improved diffusion model efficiency, directly applying
these techniques to world models introduces limitations such as quality
degradation. In this paper, we present HERO, a training-free hierarchical
acceleration framework tailored for efficient world models. Owing to the
multi-modal nature of world models, we identify a feature coupling phenomenon,
wherein shallow layers exhibit high temporal variability, while deeper layers
yield more stable feature representations. Motivated by this, HERO adopts
hierarchical strategies to accelerate inference: (i) In shallow layers, a
patch-wise refresh mechanism efficiently selects tokens for recomputation. With
patch-wise sampling and frequency-aware tracking, it avoids extra metric
computation and remain compatible with FlashAttention. (ii) In deeper layers, a
linear extrapolation scheme directly estimates intermediate features. This
completely bypasses the computations in attention modules and feed-forward
networks. Our experiments show that HERO achieves a 1.73$\times$ speedup with
minimal quality degradation, significantly outperforming existing diffusion
acceleration methods.

Abstract: Reasoning about fine-grained spatial relationships in warehouse-scale
environments poses a significant challenge for existing vision-language models
(VLMs), which often struggle to comprehend 3D layouts, object arrangements, and
multimodal cues in real-world industrial settings. In this paper, we present
TinyGiantVLM, a lightweight and modular two-stage framework designed for
physical spatial reasoning, distinguishing itself from traditional geographic
reasoning in complex logistics scenes. Our approach encodes both global and
region-level features from RGB and depth modalities using pretrained visual
backbones. To effectively handle the complexity of high-modality inputs and
diverse question types, we incorporate a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) fusion
module, which dynamically combines spatial representations to support
downstream reasoning tasks and improve convergence. Training is conducted in a
two-phase strategy: the first phase focuses on generating free-form answers to
enhance spatial reasoning ability, while the second phase uses normalized
answers for evaluation. Evaluated on Track 3 of the AI City Challenge 2025, our
64M-parameter base model achieved 5th place on the leaderboard with a score of
66.8861, demonstrating strong performance in bridging visual perception and
spatial understanding in industrial environments. We further present an
80M-parameter variant with expanded MoE capacity, which demonstrates improved
performance on spatial reasoning tasks.

TL;DR: HotSpotter是一个快速准确的动物个体识别算法，通过热点特征提取和匹配，支持多种物种识别，在1000+图像数据库中实现秒级匹配且准确率优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个不依赖物种的通用动物个体识别系统，解决现有方法在准确性和速度方面的局限性，支持大规模数据库的快速查询匹配

Method: 提出两种基于热点特征的方法：1）顺序匹配查询图像与数据库图像并评分排序；2）基于快速最近邻搜索和竞争性评分机制（源自Local Naive Bayes Nearest Neighbor算法）的实例识别方法

Result: 在包含1000多张图像的数据库上测试，相比已发表方法获得更准确的匹配结果，每个查询图像仅需几秒钟即可完成匹配

Conclusion: HotSpotter算法在动物个体识别任务中表现出优异的性能和通用性，为野生动物监测和保护提供了有效的技术工具

Abstract: We present HotSpotter, a fast, accurate algorithm for identifying individual
animals against a labeled database. It is not species specific and has been
applied to Grevy's and plains zebras, giraffes, leopards, and lionfish. We
describe two approaches, both based on extracting and matching keypoints or
"hotspots". The first tests each new query image sequentially against each
database image, generating a score for each database image in isolation, and
ranking the results. The second, building on recent techniques for instance
recognition, matches the query image against the database using a fast nearest
neighbor search. It uses a competitive scoring mechanism derived from the Local
Naive Bayes Nearest Neighbor algorithm recently proposed for category
recognition. We demonstrate results on databases of more than 1000 images,
producing more accurate matches than published methods and matching each query
image in just a few seconds.

TL;DR: 提出基于加权Vision Transformer的多任务学习框架，联合预测ADAS-Cog总分及其13个子分数，通过子分数特异性损失加权提升预测准确性和可解释性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注ADAS-Cog总分预测，忽视了13个子分数的预测价值，这些子分数反映不同认知域，某些子分数对总分确定有更大影响

Method: 使用Vision Transformer作为特征提取器，构建多任务学习框架，系统研究子分数特异性损失加权对模型性能的影响

Result: 提出的加权策略具有群体依赖性：强加权改善MCI受试者（MRI模式更异质）性能，中等加权对CN受试者（变异性较低）更有效

Conclusion: 均匀加权未充分利用关键子分数且限制泛化能力，该框架为基于MRI的AD预后提供了灵活可解释的端到端学习方法

Abstract: Prognostic modeling is essential for forecasting future clinical scores and
enabling early detection of Alzheimers disease (AD). While most existing
methods focus on predicting the ADAS-Cog global score, they often overlook the
predictive value of its 13 sub-scores, which reflect distinct cognitive
domains. Some sub-scores may exert greater influence on determining global
scores. Assigning higher loss weights to these clinically meaningful sub-scores
can guide the model to focus on more relevant cognitive domains, enhancing both
predictive accuracy and interpretability. In this study, we propose a weighted
Vision Transformer (ViT)-based multi-task learning (MTL) framework to jointly
predict the ADAS-Cog global score using baseline MRI scans and its 13
sub-scores at Month 24. Our framework integrates ViT as a feature extractor and
systematically investigates the impact of sub-score-specific loss weighting on
model performance. Results show that our proposed weighting strategies are
group-dependent: strong weighting improves performance for MCI subjects with
more heterogeneous MRI patterns, while moderate weighting is more effective for
CN subjects with lower variability. Our findings suggest that uniform weighting
underutilizes key sub-scores and limits generalization. The proposed framework
offers a flexible, interpretable approach to AD prognosis using end-to-end
MRI-based learning. (Github repo link will be provided after review)

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统虚拟试穿系统过度依赖人体掩码，对服装属性控制有限，且在真实场景中泛化能力差。需要开发无需掩码、细粒度控制且泛化能力强的解决方案。

Method: 基于多模态扩散变换器(MM-DiT)架构，将参考人物图像和目标服装图像通过专用条件路径融入去噪过程。采用双向生成策略构建数据集：一个管道使用基于掩码的模型生成参考图像，另一个对称的"Try-Off"模型以自监督方式恢复服装图像。

Result: 在DressCode等公开基准测试中达到最先进性能，在定量指标和人工评估中显著优于现有方法，在真实世界应用中表现出强大的泛化能力，超越商业系统。

Conclusion: JCo-MVTON通过创新的多模态融合和数据集构建方法，成功解决了虚拟试穿系统的关键限制，为无需掩码的高质量虚拟试穿提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Virtual try-on systems have long been hindered by heavy reliance on human
body masks, limited fine-grained control over garment attributes, and poor
generalization to real-world, in-the-wild scenarios. In this paper, we propose
JCo-MVTON (Jointly Controllable Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformer for Mask-Free
Virtual Try-On), a novel framework that overcomes these limitations by
integrating diffusion-based image generation with multi-modal conditional
fusion. Built upon a Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformer (MM-DiT) backbone, our
approach directly incorporates diverse control signals -- such as the reference
person image and the target garment image -- into the denoising process through
dedicated conditional pathways that fuse features within the self-attention
layers. This fusion is further enhanced with refined positional encodings and
attention masks, enabling precise spatial alignment and improved garment-person
integration. To address data scarcity and quality, we introduce a bidirectional
generation strategy for dataset construction: one pipeline uses a mask-based
model to generate realistic reference images, while a symmetric ``Try-Off''
model, trained in a self-supervised manner, recovers the corresponding garment
images. The synthesized dataset undergoes rigorous manual curation, allowing
iterative improvement in visual fidelity and diversity. Experiments demonstrate
that JCo-MVTON achieves state-of-the-art performance on public benchmarks
including DressCode, significantly outperforming existing methods in both
quantitative metrics and human evaluations. Moreover, it shows strong
generalization in real-world applications, surpassing commercial systems.

Motivation: 现有方法主要关注ADAS-Cog总分预测，忽视了子项评分在领域特异性认知衰退中的预测价值，且先前多任务学习研究未充分探索子项对总分的贡献机制。

Method: 采用Vision Transformer和Swin Transformer架构提取MRI影像特征，与基线及第6个月的纵向临床评分融合，构建多任务学习框架联合预测第24个月的总分和13个子项评分。

Result: 子项学习提升了总分预测精度，Q1(单词回忆)、Q4(延迟回忆)和Q8(单词识别)等少数子项主导预测结果，但这些关键子项预测误差较高，存在模型不稳定问题。

Conclusion: 研究证明了子项信息建模的价值，揭示了临床特征主导导致的不平衡学习问题，强调需要改进多模态融合和自适应损失加权来构建更可解释和临床稳健的AD预测框架。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of clinical scores is critical for early detection and
prognosis of Alzheimers disease (AD). While existing approaches primarily focus
on forecasting the ADAS-Cog global score, they often overlook the predictive
value of its sub-scores (13 items), which capture domain-specific cognitive
decline. In this study, we propose a multi task learning (MTL) framework that
jointly predicts the global ADAS-Cog score and its sub-scores (13 items) at
Month 24 using baseline MRI and longitudinal clinical scores from baseline and
Month 6. The main goal is to examine how each sub scores particularly those
associated with MRI features contribute to the prediction of the global score,
an aspect largely neglected in prior MTL studies. We employ Vision Transformer
(ViT) and Swin Transformer architectures to extract imaging features, which are
fused with longitudinal clinical inputs to model cognitive progression. Our
results show that incorporating sub-score learning improves global score
prediction. Subscore level analysis reveals that a small subset especially Q1
(Word Recall), Q4 (Delayed Recall), and Q8 (Word Recognition) consistently
dominates the predicted global score. However, some of these influential
sub-scores exhibit high prediction errors, pointing to model instability.
Further analysis suggests that this is caused by clinical feature dominance,
where the model prioritizes easily predictable clinical scores over more
complex MRI derived features. These findings emphasize the need for improved
multimodal fusion and adaptive loss weighting to achieve more balanced
learning. Our study demonstrates the value of sub score informed modeling and
provides insights into building more interpretable and clinically robust AD
prediction frameworks. (Github repo provided)

Abstract: LiDAR scanning in outdoor scenes acquires accurate distance measurements over
wide areas, producing large-scale point clouds. Application examples for this
data include robotics, automotive vehicles, and land surveillance. During such
applications, outlier objects from outside the training data will inevitably
appear. Our research contributes a novel approach to open-set segmentation,
leveraging the learnings of object defect-detection research. We also draw on
the Mamba architecture's strong performance in utilising long-range
dependencies and scalability to large data. Combining both, we create a
reconstruction based approach for the task of outdoor scene open-set
segmentation. We show that our approach improves performance not only when
applied to our our own open-set segmentation method, but also when applied to
existing methods. Furthermore we contribute a Mamba based architecture which is
competitive with existing voxel-convolution based methods on challenging,
large-scale pointclouds.

Motivation: 慢性伤口管理是重大医疗挑战，临床评估依赖主观且耗时的手动记录方法。现有2D数字视频测量框架存在视角失真、视野有限、无法捕捉伤口深度等局限性，特别是在解剖结构复杂或弯曲区域。

Method: 开发了Wound3DAssist框架，从手持智能手机短视频生成精确3D模型，整合了3D重建、伤口分割、组织分类和伤口周围分析等模块化工作流程。

Conclusion: Wound3DAssist证明了在真实临床环境中使用的可行性，为慢性伤口管理提供了实用且高效的3D评估解决方案。

Abstract: Managing chronic wounds remains a major healthcare challenge, with clinical
assessment often relying on subjective and time-consuming manual documentation
methods. Although 2D digital videometry frameworks aided the measurement
process, these approaches struggle with perspective distortion, a limited field
of view, and an inability to capture wound depth, especially in anatomically
complex or curved regions. To overcome these limitations, we present
Wound3DAssist, a practical framework for 3D wound assessment using monocular
consumer-grade videos. Our framework generates accurate 3D models from short
handheld smartphone video recordings, enabling non-contact, automatic
measurements that are view-independent and robust to camera motion. We
integrate 3D reconstruction, wound segmentation, tissue classification, and
periwound analysis into a modular workflow. We evaluate Wound3DAssist across
digital models with known geometry, silicone phantoms, and real patients.
Results show that the framework supports high-quality wound bed visualization,
millimeter-level accuracy, and reliable tissue composition analysis. Full
assessments are completed in under 20 minutes, demonstrating feasibility for
real-world clinical use.

Motivation: 现有少样本目标计数和检测方法主要关注对象类别，无法有效定位非对象模式，且将目标样本表示为空间压缩的原型会丢失结构信息

Method: 基于模板匹配和回归的检测器，在冻结骨干网络基础上使用少量可学习的卷积或投影层来保持和利用样本的空间布局

Result: 在RPINE、FSCD-147和FSCD-LVIS三个基准测试中均优于最先进方法，并在跨数据集评估中表现出强泛化能力

Conclusion: TMR方法简单有效，通过重新审视经典模板匹配技术成功解决了少样本模式检测问题，特别是在非对象模式检测方面表现优异

Abstract: We address the problem of few-shot pattern detection, which aims to detect
all instances of a given pattern, typically represented by a few exemplars,
from an input image. Although similar problems have been studied in few-shot
object counting and detection (FSCD), previous methods and their benchmarks
have narrowed patterns of interest to object categories and often fail to
localize non-object patterns. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective
detector based on template matching and regression, dubbed TMR. While previous
FSCD methods typically represent target exemplars as spatially collapsed
prototypes and lose structural information, we revisit classic template
matching and regression. It effectively preserves and leverages the spatial
layout of exemplars through a minimalistic structure with a small number of
learnable convolutional or projection layers on top of a frozen backbone We
also introduce a new dataset, dubbed RPINE, which covers a wider range of
patterns than existing object-centric datasets. Our method outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods on the three benchmarks, RPINE, FSCD-147, and
FSCD-LVIS, and demonstrates strong generalization in cross-dataset evaluation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DEHVF是一种基于动态嵌入和分层视觉特征融合的高效视觉语言微调方法，通过动态选择和融合分层视觉特征来避免序列长度扩展，在保持高效训练和推理的同时获得更高准确率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将视觉特征投影后与文本标记拼接会导致输入序列长度显著增加，产生大量计算开销。现有融合方法虽然缓解了序列长度问题，但往往忽略了模型内的分层语义表示和浅层视觉编码层中的细粒度视觉信息

Method: 通过轻量级分层视觉融合器，根据LLM各层的内部表示动态选择和融合对应语义粒度的分层特征，然后将融合后的层相关视觉特征投影对齐后直接嵌入到LLM对应层的FFN中

Result: 在ScienceQA视觉问答和COCO Captions图像描述等多个VL基准测试中，DEHVF比现有的参数高效微调基线实现了更高的准确率

Conclusion: DEHVF方法不仅避免了序列扩展，还动态融合了多层视觉信息，通过仅微调少量参数实现了跨模态信息在同一语义粒度上的精确对齐和互补

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) commonly follow a paradigm that projects
visual features and then concatenates them with text tokens to form a unified
sequence input for Large Language Models (LLMs). However, this paradigm leads
to a significant increase in the length of the input sequence, resulting in
substantial computational overhead. Existing methods attempt to fuse visual
information into the intermediate layers of LLMs, which alleviate the sequence
length issue but often neglect the hierarchical semantic representations within
the model and the fine-grained visual information available in the shallower
visual encoding layers. To address this limitation, we propose DEHVF, an
efficient vision-language fine-tuning method based on dynamic embedding and
fusion of hierarchical visual features. Its core lies in leveraging the
inherent hierarchical representation characteristics of visual encoders and
language models. Through a lightweight hierarchical visual fuser, it
dynamically selects and fuses hierarchical features corresponding to semantic
granularity based on the internal representations of each layer in LLMs. The
fused layer-related visual features are then projected and aligned before being
directly embedded into the Feed-Forward Network (FFN) of the corresponding
layer in LLMs. This approach not only avoids sequence expansion but also
dynamically fuses multi-layer visual information. By fine-tuning only a small
number of parameters, DEHVF achieves precise alignment and complementarity of
cross-modal information at the same semantic granularity. We conducted
experiments across various VL benchmarks, including visual question answering
on ScienceQA and image captioning on COCO Captions. The results demonstrate
that DEHVF achieves higher accuracy than existing parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT) baselines while maintaining efficient training and
inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多发性硬化症纵向病变分割存在输入输出数据不平衡的挑战，现有损失函数如Dice损失和交叉熵损失对此考虑不足，需要开发更好的损失函数来解决不平衡问题。

Method: 提出HyTver混合损失函数，通过结合不同损失函数的优势来解决数据不平衡问题，避免现有方法的计算复杂性和指标单一性问题。

Result: HyTver损失函数实现了0.659的Dice分数，同时距离指标与其他流行函数相当，在预训练模型上表现出良好的稳定性。

Conclusion: HyTver是一种有效的混合损失函数，能够在多发性硬化症病变分割中平衡不同性能指标，为解决数据不平衡问题提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Longitudinal Multiple Sclerosis Lesion Segmentation is a particularly
challenging problem that involves both input and output imbalance in the data
and segmentation. Therefore in order to develop models that are practical, one
of the solutions is to develop better loss functions. Most models naively use
either Dice loss or Cross-Entropy loss or their combination without too much
consideration. However, one must select an appropriate loss function as the
imbalance can be mitigated by selecting a proper loss function. In order to
solve the imbalance problem, multiple loss functions were proposed that claimed
to solve it. They come with problems of their own which include being too
computationally complex due to hyperparameters as exponents or having
detrimental performance in metrics other than region-based ones. We propose a
novel hybrid loss called HyTver that achieves good segmentation performance
while maintaining performance in other metrics. We achieve a Dice score of
0.659 while also ensuring that the distance-based metrics are comparable to
other popular functions. In addition, we also evaluate the stability of the
loss functions when used on a pre- trained model and perform extensive
comparisons with other popular loss functions

Abstract: Early diagnosis of plant diseases is critical for global food safety, yet
most AI solutions lack the generalization required for real-world agricultural
diversity. These models are typically constrained to specific species, failing
to perform accurately across the broad spectrum of cultivated plants. To
address this gap, we first introduce the FloraSyntropy Archive, a large-scale
dataset of 178,922 images across 35 plant species, annotated with 97 distinct
disease classes. We establish a benchmark by evaluating numerous existing
models on this archive, revealing a significant performance gap. We then
propose FloraSyntropy-Net, a novel federated learning framework (FL) that
integrates a Memetic Algorithm (MAO) for optimal base model selection
(DenseNet201), a novel Deep Block for enhanced feature representation, and a
client-cloning strategy for scalable, privacy-preserving training.
FloraSyntropy-Net achieves a state-of-the-art accuracy of 96.38% on the
FloraSyntropy benchmark. Crucially, to validate its generalization capability,
we test the model on the unrelated multiclass Pest dataset, where it
demonstrates exceptional adaptability, achieving 99.84% accuracy. This work
provides not only a valuable new resource but also a robust and highly
generalizable framework that advances the field towards practical, large-scale
agricultural AI applications.

Abstract: Complex tubular structures are essential in medical imaging and
computer-assisted diagnosis, where their integrity enhances anatomical
visualization and lesion detection. However, existing segmentation algorithms
struggle with structural discontinuities, particularly in severe clinical cases
such as coronary artery stenosis and vessel occlusions, which leads to
undesired discontinuity and compromising downstream diagnostic accuracy.
Therefore, it is imperative to reconnect discontinuous structures to ensure
their completeness. In this study, we explore the tubular structure completion
based on point cloud for the first time and establish a Point Cloud-based
Coronary Artery Completion (PC-CAC) dataset, which is derived from real
clinical data. This dataset provides a novel benchmark for tubular structure
completion. Additionally, we propose TSRNet, a Tubular Structure Reconnection
Network that integrates a detail-preservated feature extractor, a multiple
dense refinement strategy, and a global-to-local loss function to ensure
accurate reconnection while maintaining structural integrity. Comprehensive
experiments on our PC-CAC and two additional public datasets (PC-ImageCAS and
PC-PTR) demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches across multiple evaluation metrics, setting a new benchmark for
point cloud-based tubular structure reconstruction. Our benchmark is available

Abstract: Accurate detection of diseased glomeruli is fundamental to progress in renal
pathology and underpins the delivery of reliable clinical diagnoses. Although
recent advances in computer vision have produced increasingly sophisticated
detection algorithms, the majority of research efforts have focused on normal
glomeruli or instances of global sclerosis, leaving the wider spectrum of
diseased glomerular subtypes comparatively understudied. This disparity is not
without consequence; the nuanced and highly variable morphological
characteristics that define these disease variants frequently elude even the
most advanced computational models. Moreover, ongoing debate surrounds the
choice of optimal imaging magnifications and region-of-view dimensions for
fine-grained glomerular analysis, adding further complexity to the pursuit of
accurate classification and robust segmentation.
  To bridge these gaps, we present M^3-GloDet, a systematic framework designed
to enable thorough evaluation of detection models across a broad continuum of
regions, scales, and classes. Within this framework, we evaluate both
long-standing benchmark architectures and recently introduced state-of-the-art
models that have achieved notable performance, using an experimental design
that reflects the diversity of region-of-interest sizes and imaging resolutions
encountered in routine digital renal pathology. As the results, we found that
intermediate patch sizes offered the best balance between context and
efficiency. Additionally, moderate magnifications enhanced generalization by
reducing overfitting. Through systematic comparison of these approaches on a
multi-class diseased glomerular dataset, our aim is to advance the
understanding of model strengths and limitations, and to offer actionable
insights for the refinement of automated detection strategies and clinical
workflows in the digital pathology domain.

proposed to couple visual embeddings from multiple scales. This enriches the
detailed representation of medical images and thus improves the discrimination
of unknown diseases. Moreover, a cross-scale hard pseudo-OOD sample generation
strategy is proposed to benefit OOD detection maximally. Experimental
evaluations on three public medical datasets support that the proposed
framework achieves superior OOD detection performance compared to existing
methods. The source code is available at https://openi.pcl.ac.cn/OpenMedIA/HVL.

*Yogesh Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出LGTTP方法，通过语言引导的时间令牌剪枝来降低VLMs处理长视频的计算复杂度，在保持97-99%性能的同时减少65%计算量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在处理长视频时面临注意力机制二次复杂度的挑战，需要降低计算开销同时保持性能

Method: Language-Guided Temporal Token Pruning (LGTTP)，利用查询中的时间线索自适应剪枝视频令牌，在时间相关片段保留更高令牌密度

Result: 在TimeChat和LLaVA-Video上实现65%计算量减少，保持97-99%原性能；QVHighlights上HIT@1提升9.5%，Charades-STA上保持99.6% R@1性能

Conclusion: LGTTP在处理显式时间标记的查询上表现优异，在通用视频理解任务中保持有效性，是模型无关的高效视频处理框架

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) struggle with long-form videos due to the
quadratic complexity of attention mechanisms. We propose Language-Guided
Temporal Token Pruning (LGTTP), which leverages temporal cues from queries to
adaptively prune video tokens, preserving contextual continuity while reducing
computational overhead. Unlike uniform pruning or keyframe selection, LGTTP
retains higher token density in temporally relevant segments. Our
model-agnostic framework integrates with TimeChat and LLaVA-Video, achieving a
65% reduction in computation while preserving 97-99% of the original
performance. On QVHighlights, LGTTP improves HIT@1 by +9.5%, and on
Charades-STA, it retains 99.6% of R@1. It excels on queries with explicit
temporal markers and remains effective across general video understanding
tasks.

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has become an essential component
of medical imaging research, aiming to increase transparency and clinical trust
in deep learning models. This study investigates brain hemorrhage diagnosis
with a focus on explainability through Class Activation Mapping (CAM)
techniques. A pipeline was developed to extract pixellevel segmentation and
detection annotations from classification models using nine state-of-the-art
CAM algorithms, applied across multiple network stages, and quantitatively
evaluated on the Hemorica dataset, which uniquely provides both slice-level
labels and high-quality segmentation masks. Metrics including Dice, IoU, and
pixel-wise overlap were employed to benchmark CAM variants. Results show that
the strongest localization performance occurred at stage 5 of EfficientNetV2S,
with HiResCAM yielding the highest bounding-box alignment and AblationCAM
achieving the best pixel-level Dice (0.57) and IoU (0.40), representing strong
accuracy given that models were trained solely for classification without
segmentation supervision. To the best of current knowledge, this is among the f
irst works to quantitatively compare CAM methods for brain hemorrhage
detection, establishing a reproducible benchmark and underscoring the potential
of XAI-driven pipelines for clinically meaningful AI-assisted diagnosis.

TL;DR: CATformer是一种结合扩散模型、对抗学习和对比学习的超分辨率Transformer网络，在效率和图像质量方面优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有超分辨率方法在性能上存在差距，需要开发一种能够结合Transformer、扩散模型和GAN优势的统一框架来提升图像重建质量

Method: 采用双分支架构：主分支使用扩散启发的Transformer逐步精炼潜在表示，辅助分支通过学习的潜在对比增强噪声鲁棒性，最后使用残差密集块进行特征融合和重建

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验表明，CATformer在效率和视觉图像质量方面均优于最近的基于Transformer和扩散模型的方法

Conclusion: 该工作弥合了Transformer、扩散模型和GAN方法之间的性能差距，为扩散启发式Transformer在超分辨率中的实际应用奠定了基础

Abstract: Super-resolution remains a promising technique to enhance the quality of
low-resolution images. This study introduces CATformer (Contrastive Adversarial
Transformer), a novel neural network integrating diffusion-inspired feature
refinement with adversarial and contrastive learning. CATformer employs a
dual-branch architecture combining a primary diffusion-inspired transformer,
which progressively refines latent representations, with an auxiliary
transformer branch designed to enhance robustness to noise through learned
latent contrasts. These complementary representations are fused and decoded
using deep Residual-in-Residual Dense Blocks for enhanced reconstruction
quality. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that CATformer
outperforms recent transformer-based and diffusion-inspired methods both in
efficiency and visual image quality. This work bridges the performance gap
among transformer-, diffusion-, and GAN-based methods, laying a foundation for
practical applications of diffusion-inspired transformers in super-resolution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在动态服装重建中存在局限性：隐式表示方法几何平滑缺乏高频细节，模板重建方法使用顶点位移导致伪影

Method: 提出神经梯度变形方法(NGD)，结合自适应网格重划分策略建模动态表面(如褶皱)，并学习动态纹理图捕捉光照和阴影效果

Result: 通过大量定性和定量评估，证明该方法相比现有SOTA方法有显著改进，能够提供高质量的服装重建结果

Conclusion: NGD方法成功解决了动态服装重建中的关键挑战，实现了对复杂动态和细节的高质量建模

Abstract: Dynamic garment reconstruction from monocular video is an important yet
challenging task due to the complex dynamics and unconstrained nature of the
garments. Recent advancements in neural rendering have enabled high-quality
geometric reconstruction with image/video supervision. However, implicit
representation methods that use volume rendering often provide smooth geometry
and fail to model high-frequency details. While template reconstruction methods
model explicit geometry, they use vertex displacement for deformation, which
results in artifacts. Addressing these limitations, we propose NGD, a Neural
Gradient-based Deformation method to reconstruct dynamically evolving textured
garments from monocular videos. Additionally, we propose a novel adaptive
remeshing strategy for modelling dynamically evolving surfaces like wrinkles
and pleats of the skirt, leading to high-quality reconstruction. Finally, we
learn dynamic texture maps to capture per-frame lighting and shadow effects. We
provide extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations to demonstrate
significant improvements over existing SOTA methods and provide high-quality
garment reconstructions.

Method: 构建MLDR多模态对话数据集；提出F2RVLM模型，采用两阶段训练方式：监督微调注入片段级别检索知识，以及GRPO增强学习优化语义准确性、相关性和上下文连贯性；使用难度感知课程采样处理不同复杂度的片段。

Result: F2RVLM模型在领域内和实际场景中都显著超过了现有的视觉-语言模型，展现出更优秀的检索性能。

Conclusion: 该研究成功地解决了多模态长对话中细粒度片段检索的挑战，F2RVLM模型通过创新的训练方法和难度分级机制，显著提升了检索准确性和语义连贯性。

Abstract: Traditional dialogue retrieval aims to select the most appropriate utterance
or image from recent dialogue history. However, they often fail to meet users'
actual needs for revisiting semantically coherent content scattered across
long-form conversations. To fill this gap, we define the Fine-grained Fragment
Retrieval (FFR) task, requiring models to locate query-relevant fragments,
comprising both utterances and images, from multimodal long-form dialogues. As
a foundation for FFR, we construct MLDR, the longest-turn multimodal dialogue
retrieval dataset to date, averaging 25.45 turns per dialogue, with each
naturally spanning three distinct topics. To evaluate generalization in
real-world scenarios, we curate and annotate a WeChat-based test set comprising
real-world multimodal dialogues with an average of 75.38 turns. Building on
these resources, we explore existing generation-based Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) on FFR and observe that they often retrieve incoherent utterance-image
fragments. While optimized for generating responses from visual-textual inputs,
these models lack explicit supervision to ensure semantic coherence within
retrieved fragments. To this end, we propose F2RVLM, a generative retrieval
model trained in a two-stage paradigm: (1) supervised fine-tuning to inject
fragment-level retrieval knowledge, and (2) GRPO-based reinforcement learning
with multi-objective rewards promoting semantic precision, relevance, and
contextual coherence. To handle varying intra-fragment complexity, from locally
dense to sparsely distributed, we introduce difficulty-aware curriculum
sampling that ranks training instances by model-predicted difficulty and
gradually exposes the model to harder samples. This boosts reasoning ability in
long, multi-turn contexts. F2RVLM outperforms popular VLMs in both in-domain
and real-domain settings, demonstrating superior retrieval performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有文本到图像生成方法依赖静态偏好数据或微调，无法适应流动的用户意图和细腻偏好

Method: 使用MLLM自动从参考图像提取全局偏好信号，通过结构化指令丰富提示词，结合全局关键词控制和局部区域交叉注意力调制来指导扩散模型

Result: 在Viper数据集和自建测试集上超过现有方法，数据指标和人工评估都显示更优异的性能

Conclusion: 该框架为对话基于生成和MLLM-扩散模型集成开启了新可能，支持多轮交互精炼，实现实时上下文感知的图像生成

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generation has greatly enhanced creative expression, yet
achieving preference-aligned generation in a real-time and training-free manner
remains challenging. Previous methods often rely on static, pre-collected
preferences or fine-tuning, limiting adaptability to evolving and nuanced user
intents. In this paper, we highlight the need for instant preference-aligned
T2I generation and propose a training-free framework grounded in multimodal
large language model (MLLM) priors. Our framework decouples the task into two
components: preference understanding and preference-guided generation. For
preference understanding, we leverage MLLMs to automatically extract global
preference signals from a reference image and enrich a given prompt using
structured instruction design. Our approach supports broader and more
fine-grained coverage of user preferences than existing methods. For
preference-guided generation, we integrate global keyword-based control and
local region-aware cross-attention modulation to steer the diffusion model
without additional training, enabling precise alignment across both global
attributes and local elements. The entire framework supports multi-round
interactive refinement, facilitating real-time and context-aware image
generation. Extensive experiments on the Viper dataset and our collected
benchmark demonstrate that our method outperforms prior approaches in both
quantitative metrics and human evaluations, and opens up new possibilities for
dialog-based generation and MLLM-diffusion integration.

TL;DR: 提出统一框架解决人类动作异常检测中的少样本问题，通过对比学习和扩散模型增强训练样本，在HumanAct12数据集上取得SOTA效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要为每个动作类别单独训练模型且需要大量正常样本，这限制了在数据稀缺或新类别频繁出现的真实场景中的可扩展性和适用性

Method: 构建类别无关的表示空间进行对比学习，引入基于扩散基础模型的生成式运动增强策略来创建多样化的训练样本，通过比较测试样本与少量正常示例支持集进行异常检测

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了传统方法的局限性，为少样本人类动作异常检测提供了有效的统一解决方案，特别是在数据稀缺和新类别出现的实际应用场景中表现出色

Abstract: Human Action Anomaly Detection (HAAD) aims to identify anomalous actions
given only normal action data during training. Existing methods typically
follow a one-model-per-category paradigm, requiring separate training for each
action category and a large number of normal samples. These constraints hinder
scalability and limit applicability in real-world scenarios, where data is
often scarce or novel categories frequently appear. To address these
limitations, we propose a unified framework for HAAD that is compatible with
few-shot scenarios. Our method constructs a category-agnostic representation
space via contrastive learning, enabling AD by comparing test samples with a
given small set of normal examples (referred to as the support set). To improve
inter-category generalization and intra-category robustness, we introduce a
generative motion augmentation strategy harnessing a diffusion-based foundation
model for creating diverse and realistic training samples. Notably, to the best
of our knowledge, our work is the first to introduce such a strategy
specifically tailored to enhance contrastive learning for action AD. Extensive
experiments on the HumanAct12 dataset demonstrate the state-of-the-art
effectiveness of our approach under both seen and unseen category settings,
regarding training efficiency and model scalability for few-shot HAAD.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合U-Net分割和分类模型的深度学习框架用于宫颈癌Pap涂片检测，实验表明分割对分类性能的提升有限但略有改善


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 宫颈癌是全球女性癌症死亡的主要原因，Pap涂片人工检测耗时且易出错，需要自动化辅助诊断工具

Method: 使用U-Net进行图像分割，然后训练分类模型，基于Herlev Pap Smear数据集比较分割图像和非分割图像的分类性能

Result: 分割图像使精确度提高约0.41%，F1分数提高约1.30%，表明分割对分类性能的提升效果有限

Conclusion: 虽然分割有助于特征提取，但对分类性能影响有限，该框架可作为临床辅助工具帮助病理学家进行早期诊断

Abstract: Cervical cancer remains a significant global health concern and a leading
cause of cancer-related deaths among women. Early detection through Pap smear
tests is essential to reduce mortality rates; however, the manual examination
is time consuming and prone to human error. This study proposes a deep learning
framework that integrates U-Net for segmentation and a classification model to
enhance diagnostic performance. The Herlev Pap Smear Dataset, a publicly
available cervical cell dataset, was utilized for training and evaluation. The
impact of segmentation on classification performance was evaluated by comparing
the model trained on segmented images and another trained on non-segmented
images. Experimental results showed that the use of segmented images marginally
improved the model performance on precision (about 0.41 percent higher) and
F1-score (about 1.30 percent higher), which suggests a slightly more balanced
classification performance. While segmentation helps in feature extraction, the
results showed that its impact on classification performance appears to be
limited. The proposed framework offers a supplemental tool for clinical
applications, which may aid pathologists in early diagnosis.

Abstract: Automated colonic polyp segmentation is crucial for assisting doctors in
screening of precancerous polyps and diagnosis of colorectal neoplasms.
Although existing methods have achieved promising results, polyp segmentation
remains hindered by the following limitations,including: (1) significant
variation in polyp shapes and sizes, (2) indistinct boundaries between polyps
and adjacent tissues, and (3) small-sized polyps are easily overlooked during
the segmentation process. Driven by these practical difficulties, an innovative
architecture, CMFDNet, is proposed with the CMD module, MSA module, and FD
module. The CMD module, serving as an innovative decoder, introduces a
cross-scanning method to reduce blurry boundaries. The MSA module adopts a
multi-branch parallel structure to enhance the recognition ability for polyps
with diverse geometries and scale distributions. The FD module establishes
dependencies among all decoder features to alleviate the under-detection of
polyps with small-scale features. Experimental results show that CMFDNet
outperforms six SOTA methods used for comparison, especially on ETIS and
ColonDB datasets, where mDice scores exceed the best SOTA method by 1.83% and
1.55%, respectively.

Abstract: Estimating the 3D pose of a drone is important for anti-drone systems, but
existing methods struggle with the unique challenges of drone keypoint
detection. Drone propellers serve as keypoints but are difficult to detect due
to their high visual similarity and diversity of poses. To address these
challenges, we propose DroneKey, a framework that combines a 2D keypoint
detector and a 3D pose estimator specifically designed for drones. In the
keypoint detection stage, we extract two key-representations (intermediate and
compact) from each transformer encoder layer and optimally combine them using a
gated sum. We also introduce a pose-adaptive Mahalanobis distance in the loss
function to ensure stable keypoint predictions across extreme poses. We built
new datasets of drone 2D keypoints and 3D pose to train and evaluate our
method, which have been publicly released. Experiments show that our method
achieves an AP of 99.68% (OKS) in keypoint detection, outperforming existing
methods. Ablation studies confirm that the pose-adaptive Mahalanobis loss
function improves keypoint prediction stability and accuracy. Additionally,
improvements in the encoder design enable real-time processing at 44 FPS. For
3D pose estimation, our method achieved an MAE-angle of 10.62{\deg}, an RMSE of
0.221m, and an MAE-absolute of 0.076m, demonstrating high accuracy and
reliability. The code and dataset are available at

Motivation: 随着CLIP预训练模型被广泛用于下游任务，需要深入分析其社会偏见和人类刻板印象的传播机制，了解预训练阶段的偏见如何影响下游应用如视觉问答和图像描述。

Method: 采用全面的实证分析方法：1) 比较全局和局部数据视图下的预训练偏见变化；2) 分析不同预训练偏见水平下预训练模型与下游任务偏见的关联性；3) 探究偏见不一致性的原因，研究下游适应时表征空间的收敛现象。

Result: 研究发现偏见测量高度依赖数据子集选择；预训练偏见与下游任务偏见之间难以发现一致的趋势；当前范式下，不同预训练CLIP模型在下游任务适应时表征空间会趋于收敛。

Conclusion: 这项工作为偏见行为提供了重要见解，揭示了当前偏见转移研究中的不一致性，为未来开发更好的偏见缓解实践提供了信息基础。

Abstract: The recycling of contrastive language-image pre-trained (CLIP) models as
backbones for a large number of downstream tasks calls for a thorough analysis
of their transferability implications, especially their well-documented
reproduction of social biases and human stereotypes. How do such biases,
learned during pre-training, propagate to downstream applications like visual
question answering or image captioning? Do they transfer at all?
  We investigate this phenomenon, referred to as bias transfer in prior
literature, through a comprehensive empirical analysis. Firstly, we examine how
pre-training bias varies between global and local views of data, finding that
bias measurement is highly dependent on the subset of data on which it is
computed. Secondly, we analyze correlations between biases in the pre-trained
models and the downstream tasks across varying levels of pre-training bias,
finding difficulty in discovering consistent trends in bias transfer. Finally,
we explore why this inconsistency occurs, showing that under the current
paradigm, representation spaces of different pre-trained CLIPs tend to converge
when adapted for downstream tasks. We hope this work offers valuable insights
into bias behavior and informs future research to promote better bias
mitigation practices.

Conclusion: CEIDM方法通过双重控制机制有效提升了文本到图像生成中实体和交互关系的控制能力，生成图像质量更高且更符合逻辑

Abstract: In Text-to-Image (T2I) generation, the complexity of entities and their
intricate interactions pose a significant challenge for T2I method based on
diffusion model: how to effectively control entity and their interactions to
produce high-quality images. To address this, we propose CEIDM, a image
generation method based on diffusion model with dual controls for entity and
interaction. First, we propose an entity interactive relationships mining
approach based on Large Language Models (LLMs), extracting reasonable and rich
implicit interactive relationships through chain of thought to guide diffusion
models to generate high-quality images that are closer to realistic logic and
have more reasonable interactive relationships. Furthermore, We propose an
interactive action clustering and offset method to cluster and offset the
interactive action features contained in each text prompts. By constructing
global and local bidirectional offsets, we enhance semantic understanding and
detail supplementation of original actions, making the model's understanding of
the concept of interactive "actions" more accurate and generating images with
more accurate interactive actions. Finally, we design an entity control network
which generates masks with entity semantic guidance, then leveraging
multi-scale convolutional network to enhance entity feature and dynamic network
to fuse feature. It effectively controls entities and significantly improves
image quality. Experiments show that the proposed CEIDM method is better than
the most representative existing methods in both entity control and their
interaction control.

Abstract: Anomaly detection is fundamental for ensuring quality control and operational
efficiency in industrial environments, yet conventional approaches face
significant challenges when training data contains mislabeled samples-a common
occurrence in real-world scenarios. This paper presents RAD, a robust anomaly
detection framework that integrates Normalizing Flows with Model-Agnostic
Meta-Learning to address the critical challenge of label noise in industrial
settings. Our approach employs a bi-level optimization strategy where
meta-learning enables rapid adaptation to varying noise conditions, while
uncertainty quantification guides adaptive L2 regularization to maintain model
stability. The framework incorporates multiscale feature processing through
pretrained feature extractors and leverages the precise likelihood estimation
capabilities of Normalizing Flows for robust anomaly scoring. Comprehensive
evaluation on MVTec-AD and KSDD2 datasets demonstrates superior performance,
achieving I-AUROC scores of 95.4% and 94.6% respectively under clean
conditions, while maintaining robust detection capabilities above 86.8% and
92.1% even when 50% of training samples are mislabeled. The results highlight
RAD's exceptional resilience to noisy training conditions and its ability to
detect subtle anomalies across diverse industrial scenarios, making it a
practical solution for real-world anomaly detection applications where perfect
data curation is challenging.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在节俭学习、迁移学习和常规学习场景下都能实现显著的时间和资源节省，同时保持分割质量。

Conclusion: 该方法解决了完全标注数据集的限制问题，为细胞分割提供了更高效且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: The most popular networks used for cell segmentation (e.g. Cellpose,
Stardist, HoverNet,...) rely on a prediction of a distance map. It yields
unprecedented accuracy but hinges on fully annotated datasets. This is a
serious limitation to generate training sets and perform transfer learning. In
this paper, we propose a method that still relies on the distance map and
handles partially annotated objects. We evaluate the performance of the
proposed approach in the contexts of frugal learning, transfer learning and
regular learning on regular databases. Our experiments show that it can lead to
substantial savings in time and resources without sacrificing segmentation
quality. The proposed algorithm is embedded in a user-friendly Napari plugin.

TL;DR: 通过位置重新加权机制来减轻视觉刷选中的近期偏误，提高视觉刷选效果


<details>

Motivation: 视视觉语言模型中存在近期偏误，导致图像底部刷选不优，需要解决这个问题

Method: 提出位置重新加权机制，根据视觉刷选的空间位置调整关注分数

Result: 在LVLM上的实验表明方法能够在最小计算开销下提升视觉刷选性能

Conclusion: 该方法是一个即插即用的解决方案，无需改变模型结构或进行额外训练

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) typically process a significantly larger number
of visual tokens compared to text tokens due to the inherent redundancy in
visual signals. Visual token pruning is a promising direction to reduce the
computational cost of VLMs by eliminating redundant visual tokens. The
text-visual attention score is a widely adopted criterion for visual token
pruning as it reflects the relevance of visual tokens to the text input.
However, many sequence models exhibit a recency bias, where tokens appearing
later in the sequence exert a disproportionately large influence on the model's
output. In VLMs, this bias manifests as inflated attention scores for tokens
corresponding to the lower regions of the image, leading to suboptimal pruning
that disproportionately retains tokens from the image bottom. In this paper, we
present an extremely simple yet effective approach to alleviate the recency
bias in visual token pruning. We propose a straightforward reweighting
mechanism that adjusts the attention scores of visual tokens according to their
spatial positions in the image. Our method, termed Position-reweighted Visual
Token Pruning, is a plug-and-play solution that can be seamlessly incorporated
into existing visual token pruning frameworks without any changes to the model
architecture or extra training. Extensive experiments on LVLMs demonstrate that
our method improves the performance of visual token pruning with minimal
computational overhead.

TL;DR: UniSino是一个用于CT投影数据标准化的基础模型，直接在投影域处理数据，相比传统方法具有更好的泛化能力，能够处理多种欠采样和噪声问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CT成像中原始数据采集时，欠采样和噪声等因素会严重降低重建图像质量，影响诊断准确性。传统方法依赖手动设计的算法或固定经验参数，缺乏对不同类型伪影的泛化能力。

Method: 提出UniSino基础模型，直接在投影域标准化数据，训练框架结合了投影数据的物理特性，增强了模型的泛化能力，能够在多个子任务和四个基准数据集上实现稳健性能。

Result: 实验结果表明，UniSino在单一和混合欠采样情况下都能实现优越的重建质量，在CT成像的投影数据增强方面表现出卓越的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: UniSino通过在投影域直接处理数据，解决了传统方法的泛化局限性，为CT成像提供了一种通用的投影数据标准化解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: During raw-data acquisition in CT imaging, diverse factors can degrade the
collected sinograms, with undersampling and noise leading to severe artifacts
and noise in reconstructed images and compromising diagnostic accuracy.
Conventional correction methods rely on manually designed algorithms or fixed
empirical parameters, but these approaches often lack generalizability across
heterogeneous artifact types. To address these limitations, we propose UniSino,
a foundation model for universal CT sinogram standardization. Unlike existing
foundational models that operate in image domain, UniSino directly standardizes
data in the projection domain, which enables stronger generalization across
diverse undersampling scenarios. Its training framework incorporates the
physical characteristics of sinograms, enhancing generalization and enabling
robust performance across multiple subtasks spanning four benchmark datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate thatUniSino achieves superior reconstruction
quality both single and mixed undersampling case, demonstrating exceptional
robustness and generalization in sinogram enhancement for CT imaging. The code

Conclusion: 该框架通过显式时间建模和视觉-语义协作，有效解决了视频融合中的时间一致性问题，为视频融合领域提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Existing multi-modal fusion methods typically apply static frame-based image
fusion techniques directly to video fusion tasks, neglecting inherent temporal
dependencies and leading to inconsistent results across frames. To address this
limitation, we propose the first video fusion framework that explicitly
incorporates temporal modeling with visual-semantic collaboration to
simultaneously ensure visual fidelity, semantic accuracy, and temporal
consistency. First, we introduce a visual-semantic interaction module
consisting of a semantic branch and a visual branch, with Dinov2 and VGG19
employed for targeted distillation, allowing simultaneous enhancement of both
the visual and semantic representations. Second, we pioneer integrate the video
degradation enhancement task into the video fusion pipeline by constructing a
temporal cooperative module, which leverages temporal dependencies to
facilitate weak information recovery. Third, to ensure temporal consistency, we
embed a temporal-enhanced mechanism into the network and devise a temporal loss
to guide the optimization process. Finally, we introduce two innovative
evaluation metrics tailored for video fusion, aimed at assessing the temporal
consistency of the generated fused videos. Extensive experimental results on
public video datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method. Our code is

Motivation: 工业和医疗异常检测面临数据稀缺和标注成本高的挑战，特别是在快速变化的制造和医疗环境中，需要开发能够快速适应新领域的零样本检测方法。

Method: 采用软置信学习为所有训练数据分配基于置信度的权重，保留边界信息同时强调典型正常模式；通过IQR阈值量化数据不确定性，基于协方差的正则化量化模型不确定性；结合模型无关元学习和对比学习创建判别性特征空间。

Conclusion: 该框架消除了对视觉语言对齐或模型集成的依赖，适用于资源受限环境下需要快速部署的场景，为工业和医疗异常检测提供了有效的零样本解决方案。

Abstract: Industrial and medical anomaly detection faces critical challenges from data
scarcity and prohibitive annotation costs, particularly in evolving
manufacturing and healthcare settings. To address this, we propose CoZAD, a
novel zero-shot anomaly detection framework that integrates soft confident
learning with meta-learning and contrastive feature representation. Unlike
traditional confident learning that discards uncertain samples, our method
assigns confidence-based weights to all training data, preserving boundary
information while emphasizing prototypical normal patterns. The framework
quantifies data uncertainty through IQR-based thresholding and model
uncertainty via covariance based regularization within a Model-Agnostic
Meta-Learning. Contrastive learning creates discriminative feature spaces where
normal patterns form compact clusters, enabling rapid domain adaptation.
Comprehensive evaluation across 10 datasets spanning industrial and medical
domains demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing
methods on 6 out of 7 industrial benchmarks with notable improvements on
texture-rich datasets (99.2% I-AUROC on DTD-Synthetic, 97.2% on BTAD) and
pixellevel localization (96.3% P-AUROC on MVTec-AD). The framework eliminates
dependence on vision-language alignments or model ensembles, making it valuable
for resourceconstrained environments requiring rapid deployment.

Result: 通过大量实验证明，该方法在生成真实室内场景方面优于现有方法

Conclusion: 这项工作推进了场景生成领域的发展，为需要详细3D环境的应用开辟了新可能性

Abstract: Realistic 3D indoor scene generation is crucial for virtual reality, interior
design, embodied intelligence, and scene understanding. While existing methods
have made progress in coarse-scale furniture arrangement, they struggle to
capture fine-grained object placements, limiting the realism and utility of
generated environments. This gap hinders immersive virtual experiences and
detailed scene comprehension for embodied AI applications. To address these
issues, we propose Hierarchical Layout Generation (HLG), a novel method for
fine-grained 3D scene generation. HLG is the first to adopt a coarse-to-fine
hierarchical approach, refining scene layouts from large-scale furniture
placement to intricate object arrangements. Specifically, our fine-grained
layout alignment module constructs a hierarchical layout through vertical and
horizontal decoupling, effectively decomposing complex 3D indoor scenes into
multiple levels of granularity. Additionally, our trainable layout optimization
network addresses placement issues, such as incorrect positioning, orientation
errors, and object intersections, ensuring structurally coherent and physically
plausible scene generation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
through extensive experiments, showing superior performance in generating
realistic indoor scenes compared to existing methods. This work advances the
field of scene generation and opens new possibilities for applications
requiring detailed 3D environments. We will release our code upon publication
to encourage future research.

Conclusion: SCOUT方法通过有效利用未标注数据和文本信息，显著提升了半监督伪装目标检测的性能

Abstract: The difficulty of pixel-level annotation has significantly hindered the
development of the Camouflaged Object Detection (COD) field. To save on
annotation costs, previous works leverage the semi-supervised COD framework
that relies on a small number of labeled data and a large volume of unlabeled
data. We argue that there is still significant room for improvement in the
effective utilization of unlabeled data. To this end, we introduce a
Semi-supervised Camouflaged Object Detection by Utilizing Text and Adaptive
Data Selection (SCOUT). It includes an Adaptive Data Augment and Selection
(ADAS) module and a Text Fusion Module (TFM). The ADSA module selects valuable
data for annotation through an adversarial augment and sampling strategy. The
TFM module further leverages the selected valuable data by combining
camouflage-related knowledge and text-visual interaction. To adapt to this
work, we build a new dataset, namely RefTextCOD. Extensive experiments show
that the proposed method surpasses previous semi-supervised methods in the COD
field and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our code will be released at

Abstract: Medical image segmentation models struggle with rare abnormalities due to
scarce annotated pathological data. We propose DiffAug a novel framework that
combines textguided diffusion-based generation with automatic segmentation
validation to address this challenge. Our proposed approach uses latent
diffusion models conditioned on medical text descriptions and spatial masks to
synthesize abnormalities via inpainting on normal images. Generated samples
undergo dynamic quality validation through a latentspace segmentation network
that ensures accurate localization while enabling single-step inference. The
text prompts, derived from medical literature, guide the generation of diverse
abnormality types without requiring manual annotation. Our validation mechanism
filters synthetic samples based on spatial accuracy, maintaining quality while
operating efficiently through direct latent estimation. Evaluated on three
medical imaging benchmarks (CVC-ClinicDB, Kvasir-SEG, REFUGE2), our framework
achieves state-of-the-art performance with 8-10% Dice improvements over
baselines and reduces false negative rates by up to 28% for challenging cases

Motivation: 预训练视觉语言模型具有出色的零样本泛化能力，但提示调优的泛化能力有限。标签平滑作为有效正则化技术可防止模型过拟合，但直接应用会削弱提示调优性能。

Method: 提出交替训练标签平滑(ATLaS)方法，交替使用标准one-hot标签和LS生成的软标签进行监督。引入类级软标签(CSL)和实例级软标签(ISL)提供类间或实例-类关系。

Result: 大量实验表明ATLaS方法结合CSL和ISL能持续提升提示调优的泛化性能，且与主流提示调优方法高度兼容。

Conclusion: ATLaS方法有效解决了标签平滑在提示调优中的负面效应，通过交替训练和高效软标签设计显著提升了提示调优的泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in pre-trained vision-language models have demonstrated
remarkable zero-shot generalization capabilities. To further enhance these
models' adaptability to various downstream tasks, prompt tuning has emerged as
a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method. However, despite its efficiency, the
generalization ability of prompt remains limited. In contrast, label smoothing
(LS) has been widely recognized as an effective regularization technique that
prevents models from becoming over-confident and improves their generalization.
This inspires us to explore the integration of LS with prompt tuning. However,
we have observed that the vanilla LS even weakens the generalization ability of
prompt tuning. To address this issue, we propose the Alternating Training-based
Label Smoothing (ATLaS) method, which alternately trains with standard one-hot
labels and soft labels generated by LS to supervise the prompt tuning.
Moreover, we introduce two types of efficient offline soft labels, including
Class-wise Soft Labels (CSL) and Instance-wise Soft Labels (ISL), to provide
inter-class or instance-class relationships for prompt tuning. The theoretical
properties of the proposed ATLaS method are analyzed. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that the proposed ATLaS method, combined with CSL and ISL,
consistently enhances the generalization performance of prompt tuning.
Moreover, the proposed ATLaS method exhibits high compatibility with prevalent
prompt tuning methods, enabling seamless integration into existing methods.

Motivation: 目标检测需要费用昂贵的框标注，活跃学习可以减轻标注负担。但在框级别AL中，早期模型只能在多数类别上表现良好，导致假标签严重类别不平衡。

Conclusion: 该方法通过类别均衡的样本选择和软假标签技术，有效地减少目标检测中的标注成本，并显著提高了模型的检测性能。

Abstract: Training deep object detectors demands expensive bounding box annotation.
Active learning (AL) is a promising technique to alleviate the annotation
burden. Performing AL at box-level for object detection, i.e., selecting the
most informative boxes to label and supplementing the sparsely-labelled image
with pseudo labels, has been shown to be more cost-effective than selecting and
labelling the entire image. In box-level AL for object detection, we observe
that models at early stage can only perform well on majority classes, making
the pseudo labels severely class-imbalanced. We propose a class-balanced
sampling strategy to select more objects from minority classes for labelling,
so as to make the final training data, \ie, ground truth labels obtained by AL
and pseudo labels, more class-balanced to train a better model. We also propose
a task-aware soft pseudo labelling strategy to increase the accuracy of pseudo
labels. We evaluate our method on public benchmarking datasets and show that
our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态大语言模型中视觉token过多导致的推理效率低下问题，需要在压缩token的同时尽可能保留视觉信息

Method: 1) 图基视觉token聚合(VTA)：将视觉token视为节点构建语义相似图，将被移除token的信息聚合到保留token中；2) 分组token选择策略(GTS)：按文本token指导将视觉token分组并逐步聚合

Result: 在LLaVA-1.5、LLaVA-NeXT和Video-LLaVA等多个基准测试中表现优于现有方法，实现了模型性能和推理速度的更好平衡

Conclusion: VISA方法有效解决了MLLM中视觉token过多的问题，在保持视觉信息完整性的同时显著提升推理效率

Abstract: In this study, we introduce a novel method called group-wise \textbf{VI}sual
token \textbf{S}election and \textbf{A}ggregation (VISA) to address the issue
of inefficient inference stemming from excessive visual tokens in multimoal
large language models (MLLMs). Compared with previous token pruning approaches,
our method can preserve more visual information while compressing visual
tokens. We first propose a graph-based visual token aggregation (VTA) module.
VTA treats each visual token as a node, forming a graph based on semantic
similarity among visual tokens. It then aggregates information from removed
tokens into kept tokens based on this graph, producing a more compact visual
token representation. Additionally, we introduce a group-wise token selection
strategy (GTS) to divide visual tokens into kept and removed ones, guided by
text tokens from the final layers of each group. This strategy progressively
aggregates visual information, enhancing the stability of the visual
information extraction process. We conduct comprehensive experiments on
LLaVA-1.5, LLaVA-NeXT, and Video-LLaVA across various benchmarks to validate
the efficacy of VISA. Our method consistently outperforms previous methods,
achieving a superior trade-off between model performance and inference speed.

Conclusion: 该方法简单通用，能有效解决多图像VQA中的视觉冗余问题，显著提高模型性能

Abstract: The advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has driven
significant progress in Visual Question Answering (VQA), evolving from Single
to Multi Image VQA (MVQA). However, the increased number of images in MVQA
inevitably introduces substantial visual redundancy that is irrelevant to
question answering, negatively impacting both accuracy and efficiency. To
address this issue, existing methods lack flexibility in controlling the number
of compressed visual tokens and tend to produce discrete visual fragments,
which hinder MLLMs' ability to comprehend images holistically. In this paper,
we propose a straightforward yet universal Adaptive Visual Anchoring strategy,
which can be seamlessly integrated into existing MLLMs, offering significant
accuracy improvements through adaptive compression. Meanwhile, to balance the
results derived from both global and compressed visual input, we further
introduce a novel collaborative decoding mechanism, enabling optimal
performance. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method,
demonstrating consistent performance improvements across various MLLMs. The
code will be publicly available.

Conclusion: GS-SMC框架提供了一种无需重新训练、轻量级且高精度的相机位姿精炼方案，能够直接应用于各种场景，在精度和实用性方面都有显著提升。

Abstract: Camera pose refinement aims at improving the accuracy of initial pose
estimation for applications in 3D computer vision. Most refinement approaches
rely on 2D-3D correspondences with specific descriptors or dedicated networks,
requiring reconstructing the scene again for a different descriptor or fully
retraining the network for each scene. Some recent methods instead infer pose
from feature similarity, but their lack of geometry constraints results in less
accuracy. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel camera pose
refinement framework leveraging 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), referred to as
GS-SMC. Given the widespread usage of 3DGS, our method can employ an existing
3DGS model to render novel views, providing a lightweight solution that can be
directly applied to diverse scenes without additional training or fine-tuning.
Specifically, we introduce an iterative optimization approach, which refines
the camera pose using epipolar geometric constraints among the query and
multiple rendered images. Our method allows flexibly choosing feature
extractors and matchers to establish these constraints. Extensive empirical
evaluations on the 7-Scenes and the Cambridge Landmarks datasets demonstrate
that our method outperforms state-of-the-art camera pose refinement approaches,
achieving 53.3% and 56.9% reductions in median translation and rotation errors
on 7-Scenes, and 40.7% and 53.2% on Cambridge.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative models has led to a growing prevalence of
highly realistic AI-generated images, posing significant challenges for digital
forensics and content authentication. Conventional detection methods mainly
rely on deep learning models that extract global features, which often overlook
subtle structural inconsistencies and demand substantial computational
resources. To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid detection
framework that combines a fine-tuned Vision Transformer (ViT) with a novel
edge-based image processing module. The edge-based module computes variance
from edge-difference maps generated before and after smoothing, exploiting the
observation that AI-generated images typically exhibit smoother textures,
weaker edges, and reduced noise compared to real images. When applied as a
post-processing step on ViT predictions, this module enhances sensitivity to
fine-grained structural cues while maintaining computational efficiency.
Extensive experiments on the CIFAKE, Artistic, and Custom Curated datasets
demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves superior detection performance
across all benchmarks, attaining 97.75% accuracy and a 97.77% F1-score on
CIFAKE, surpassing widely adopted state-of-the-art models. These results
establish the proposed method as a lightweight, interpretable, and effective
solution for both still images and video frames, making it highly suitable for

Enhancement (LLIE) that seamlessly integrates illumination and semantic priors.
Our architecture includes an original self-attention block, Hybrid Illumination
and Semantics-Aware Multi-Headed Self- Attention (HISA-MSA), which integrates
illumination and semantic segmentation maps for en- hanced feature extraction.
ISALux employs two self-attention modules to independently process illumination
and semantic features, selectively enriching each other to regulate luminance
and high- light structural variations in real-world scenarios. A Mixture of
Experts (MoE)-based Feed-Forward Network (FFN) enhances contextual learning,
with a gating mechanism conditionally activating the top K experts for
specialized processing. To address overfitting in LLIE methods caused by
distinct light patterns in benchmarking datasets, we enhance the HISA-MSA
module with low-rank matrix adaptations (LoRA). Extensive qualitative and
quantitative evaluations across multiple specialized datasets demonstrate that
ISALux is competitive with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Addition- ally, an
ablation study highlights the contribution of each component in the proposed
model. Code will be released upon publication.

TL;DR: UniAPO是一个统一的多模态自动提示优化框架，通过EM启发式优化过程和短长期记忆机制，解决了视觉令牌膨胀和过程级监督缺失的问题，在文本、图像和视频基准测试中均取得显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动提示优化方法主要针对纯文本输入，扩展到多模态任务时面临两个核心挑战：视觉令牌膨胀导致上下文容量受限和反馈信号不足，以及缺乏过程级监督限制了提示优化的效果。

Method: 采用EM启发式优化过程，将反馈建模和提示优化解耦；引入短长期记忆机制，历史反馈缓解上下文限制，历史提示提供方向性指导。

Result: 在文本、图像和视频基准测试中均取得一致性的性能提升，建立了高效且可迁移的统一提示优化框架。

Conclusion: UniAPO是首个专门为多模态自动提示优化设计的框架，通过创新的优化策略有效解决了多模态场景下的核心挑战，为多模态提示优化提供了统一的解决方案。

Abstract: Prompting is fundamental to unlocking the full potential of large language
models. To automate and enhance this process, automatic prompt optimization
(APO) has been developed, demonstrating effectiveness primarily in text-only
input scenarios. However, extending existing APO methods to multimodal tasks,
such as video-language generation introduces two core challenges: (i) visual
token inflation, where long visual token sequences restrict context capacity
and result in insufficient feedback signals; (ii) a lack of process-level
supervision, as existing methods focus on outcome-level supervision and
overlook intermediate supervision, limiting prompt optimization. We present
UniAPO: Unified Multimodal Automated Prompt Optimization, the first framework
tailored for multimodal APO. UniAPO adopts an EM-inspired optimization process
that decouples feedback modeling and prompt refinement, making the optimization
more stable and goal-driven. To further address the aforementioned challenges,
we introduce a short-long term memory mechanism: historical feedback mitigates
context limitations, while historical prompts provide directional guidance for
effective prompt optimization. UniAPO achieves consistent gains across text,
image, and video benchmarks, establishing a unified framework for efficient and
transferable prompt optimization.

Motivation: 传统VSR系统依赖深度神经网络，计算成本高，硬件需求大，限制了在实际资源受限场景中的应用和部署

Method: 采用标准双网络设计范式，首先对图像分类中的高效模型进行基准测试，然后在时序卷积网络骨干中采用轻量级块设计，开发统一的低资源需求模型

Result: 在最大的英语单词公共数据库上的实验证明了所开发模型的有效性和实用性

Conclusion: 提出的轻量级架构能够在降低硬件成本的同时保持强大的识别性能，提高了VSR系统在现实场景中的适用性

Abstract: Visual speech recognition (VSR) systems decode spoken words from an input
sequence using only the video data. Practical applications of such systems
include medical assistance as well as human-machine interactions. A VSR system
is typically employed in a complementary role in cases where the audio is
corrupt or not available. In order to accurately predict the spoken words,
these architectures often rely on deep neural networks in order to extract
meaningful representations from the input sequence. While deep architectures
achieve impressive recognition performance, relying on such models incurs
significant computation costs which translates into increased resource demands
in terms of hardware requirements and results in limited applicability in
real-world scenarios where resources might be constrained. This factor prevents
wider adoption and deployment of speech recognition systems in more practical
applications. In this work, we aim to alleviate this issue by developing
architectures for VSR that have low hardware costs. Following the standard
two-network design paradigm, where one network handles visual feature
extraction and another one utilizes the extracted features to classify the
entire sequence, we develop lightweight end-to-end architectures by first
benchmarking efficient models from the image classification literature, and
then adopting lightweight block designs in a temporal convolution network
backbone. We create several unified models with low resource requirements but
strong recognition performance. Experiments on the largest public database for
English words demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of our developed
models. Code and trained models will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Depth estimation is a foundational component for 3D reconstruction in
minimally invasive endoscopic surgeries. However, existing monocular depth
estimation techniques often exhibit limited performance to the varying
illumination and complex textures of the surgical environment. While powerful
visual foundation models offer a promising solution, their training on natural
images leads to significant domain adaptability limitations and semantic
perception deficiencies when applied to endoscopy. In this study, we introduce
EndoUFM, an unsupervised monocular depth estimation framework that innovatively
integrating dual foundation models for surgical scenes, which enhance the depth
estimation performance by leveraging the powerful pre-learned priors. The
framework features a novel adaptive fine-tuning strategy that incorporates
Random Vector Low-Rank Adaptation (RVLoRA) to enhance model adaptability, and a
Residual block based on Depthwise Separable Convolution (Res-DSC) to improve
the capture of fine-grained local features. Furthermore, we design a
mask-guided smoothness loss to enforce depth consistency within anatomical
tissue structures. Extensive experiments on the SCARED, Hamlyn, SERV-CT, and
EndoNeRF datasets confirm that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance
while maintaining an efficient model size. This work contributes to augmenting
surgeons' spatial perception during minimally invasive procedures, thereby
enhancing surgical precision and safety, with crucial implications for
augmented reality and navigation systems.

Abstract: Progress in remote PhotoPlethysmoGraphy (rPPG) is limited by the critical
issues of existing publicly available datasets: small size, privacy concerns
with facial videos, and lack of diversity in conditions. The paper introduces a
novel comprehensive large-scale multi-view video dataset for rPPG and health
biomarkers estimation. Our dataset comprises 3600 synchronized video recordings
from 600 subjects, captured under varied conditions (resting and post-exercise)
using multiple consumer-grade cameras at different angles. To enable multimodal
analysis of physiological states, each recording is paired with a 100 Hz PPG
signal and extended health metrics, such as electrocardiogram, arterial blood
pressure, biomarkers, temperature, oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, and
stress level. Using this data, we train an efficient rPPG model and compare its
quality with existing approaches in cross-dataset scenarios. The public release
of our dataset and model should significantly speed up the progress in the

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前长视频问答系统采用解耦的刚性流程，导致信息丢失或计算效率低下，无法根据不同查询需求自适应提取视觉证据。

Method: 采用三层创新：分层推理精确定位帧、跨模态语义桥接进行目标提取、置信度驱动的迭代合成，形成推理指导视觉提取的闭环系统。

Result: 在EgoSchema(65.7%, +5.3%)、NExT-QA(76.1%, +2.6%)和IntentQA(73.8%, +6.9%)等基准测试中取得最先进性能。

Conclusion: 动态推理-感知协调为视频理解提供了可扩展的范式，显著提升了视频问答系统的性能。

Abstract: Human video comprehension demonstrates dynamic coordination between reasoning
and visual attention, adaptively focusing on query-relevant details. However,
current long-form video question answering systems employ rigid pipelines that
decouple reasoning from perception, leading to either information loss through
premature visual abstraction or computational inefficiency through exhaustive
processing. The core limitation lies in the inability to adapt visual
extraction to specific reasoning requirements, different queries demand
fundamentally different visual evidence from the same video content. In this
work, we present CAVIA, a training-free framework that revolutionizes video
understanding through reasoning, perception coordination. Unlike conventional
approaches where visual processing operates independently of reasoning, CAVIA
creates a closed-loop system where reasoning continuously guides visual
extraction based on identified information gaps. CAVIA introduces three
innovations: (1) hierarchical reasoning, guided localization to precise frames;
(2) cross-modal semantic bridging for targeted extraction; (3)
confidence-driven iterative synthesis. CAVIA achieves state-of-the-art
performance on challenging benchmarks: EgoSchema (65.7%, +5.3%), NExT-QA
(76.1%, +2.6%), and IntentQA (73.8%, +6.9%), demonstrating that dynamic
reasoning-perception coordination provides a scalable paradigm for video
understanding.

Motivation: 研究旨在探索如何通过整合体积上下文信息来改进CT扫描中稀疏采样条纹伪影的校正效果，提高模型性能

Method: 使用22名受试者的临床CT数据，通过Astra工具箱模拟平行、扇形和锥形光束几何形状的稀疏采样CT体积。训练和验证2D和3D U-Net模型，比较512x512 2D图像、2.5D数据（三个正交平面的组合）和3D数据块（64x64x64体素）的性能

Result: 对于所有光束几何形状，在轴向2D切片上训练的2D U-Net获得了最佳的MSE和SSIM值，表现优于2.5D和3D输入数据维度

Conclusion: 尽管预期体积上下文信息能提升性能，但2D方法在CT稀疏采样伪影校正任务中仍然表现最佳，这可能表明当前任务中空间上下文的重要性超过了体积维度信息

Abstract: This study aims to investigate the effect of various beam geometries and
dimensions of input data on the sparse-sampling streak artifact correction task
with U-Nets for clinical CT scans as a means of incorporating the volumetric
context into artifact reduction tasks to improve model performance. A total of
22 subjects were retrospectively selected (01.2016-12.2018) from the Technical
University of Munich's research hospital, TUM Klinikum rechts der Isar.
Sparsely-sampled CT volumes were simulated with the Astra toolbox for parallel,
fan, and cone beam geometries. 2048 views were taken as full-view scans. 2D and
3D U-Nets were trained and validated on 14, and tested on 8 subjects,
respectively. For the dimensionality study, in addition to the 512x512 2D CT
images, the CT scans were further pre-processed to generate a so-called '2.5D',
and 3D data: Each CT volume was divided into 64x64x64 voxel blocks. The 3D data
refers to individual 64-voxel blocks. An axial, coronal, and sagittal cut
through the center of each block resulted in three 64x64 2D patches that were
rearranged as a single 64x64x3 image, proposed as 2.5D data. Model performance
was assessed with the mean squared error (MSE) and structural similarity index
measure (SSIM). For all geometries, the 2D U-Net trained on axial 2D slices
results in the best MSE and SSIM values, outperforming the 2.5D and 3D input
data dimensions.

Motivation: 现有的场景回归方法（如VGGT）在处理极端视角变化的图像时表现出色，但难以处理大量输入图像。为了解决这个问题，需要开发能够高效扩展到大规模场景的方法。

Method: 首先从锚点图像子集计算神经场景表示，然后对回归网络进行微调，使其能够基于该神经场景表示重建所有输入图像。采用前馈Transformer架构增强视觉定位能力。

Result: 在TUM-RGBD、CO3Dv2和Tanks & Temples等基准测试中，该方法不仅能够高效扩展到大规模场景，还在相机姿态估计和新视角合成方面达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: SAIL-Recon通过结合神经场景表示和视觉定位能力，成功解决了大规模SfM问题，为处理大量输入图像提供了有效的解决方案，并在多个基准测试中表现出色。

Abstract: Scene regression methods, such as VGGT, solve the Structure-from-Motion (SfM)
problem by directly regressing camera poses and 3D scene structures from input
images. They demonstrate impressive performance in handling images under
extreme viewpoint changes. However, these methods struggle to handle a large
number of input images. To address this problem, we introduce SAIL-Recon, a
feed-forward Transformer for large scale SfM, by augmenting the scene
regression network with visual localization capabilities. Specifically, our
method first computes a neural scene representation from a subset of anchor
images. The regression network is then fine-tuned to reconstruct all input
images conditioned on this neural scene representation. Comprehensive
experiments show that our method not only scales efficiently to large-scale
scenes, but also achieves state-of-the-art results on both camera pose
estimation and novel view synthesis benchmarks, including TUM-RGBD, CO3Dv2, and
Tanks & Temples. We will publish our model and code. Code and models are

Conclusion: 混合模型架构能够有效应对数据漂移问题，提供更好的道路安全性，证明了混合结构在提高计算机视觉系统鲁棒性方面的有效性。

Abstract: The use of computer vision in automotive is a trending research in which
safety and security are a primary concern. In particular, for autonomous
driving, preventing road accidents requires highly accurate object detection
under diverse conditions. To address this issue, recently the International
Organization for Standardization (ISO) released the 8800 norm, providing
structured frameworks for managing associated AI relevant risks. However,
challenging scenarios such as adverse weather or low lighting often introduce
data drift, leading to degraded model performance and potential safety
violations. In this work, we present a novel hybrid computer vision
architecture trained with thousands of synthetic image data from the road
environment to improve robustness in unseen drifted environments. Our dual mode
framework utilized YOLO version 8 for swift detection and incorporated a
five-layer CNN for verification. The system functioned in sequence and improved
the detection accuracy by more than 90\% when tested with drift-augmented road
images. The focus was to demonstrate how such a hybrid model can provide better
road safety when working together in a hybrid structure.

Conclusion: 通过语义推理与法医分析的协同结合，实现了全面的检测准确性和定位精度

Abstract: The increasing sophistication of image manipulation techniques demands robust
forensic solutions that can both reliably detect alterations and precisely
localize tampered regions. Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show
promise by leveraging world knowledge and semantic understanding for
context-aware detection, yet they struggle with perceiving subtle, low-level
forensic artifacts crucial for accurate manipulation localization. This paper
presents a novel Propose-Rectify framework that effectively bridges semantic
reasoning with forensic-specific analysis. In the proposal stage, our approach
utilizes a forensic-adapted LLaVA model to generate initial manipulation
analysis and preliminary localization of suspicious regions based on semantic
understanding and contextual reasoning. In the rectification stage, we
introduce a Forensics Rectification Module that systematically validates and
refines these initial proposals through multi-scale forensic feature analysis,
integrating technical evidence from several specialized filters. Additionally,
we present an Enhanced Segmentation Module that incorporates critical forensic
cues into SAM's encoded image embeddings, thereby overcoming inherent semantic
biases to achieve precise delineation of manipulated regions. By
synergistically combining advanced multimodal reasoning with established
forensic methodologies, our framework ensures that initial semantic proposals
are systematically validated and enhanced through concrete technical evidence,
resulting in comprehensive detection accuracy and localization precision.
Extensive experimental validation demonstrates state-of-the-art performance
across diverse datasets with exceptional robustness and generalization
capabilities.

TL;DR: 提出基于知识蒸馏的跨域蒸馏框架CDD，解决完全无监督异常检测中训练数据包含异常样本的问题，通过在多个低异常比域上训练域特定学生模型，并聚合跨域知识来提升异常检测性能。


<details>

Motivation: 完全无监督异常检测(FUAD)要求在没有标签的情况下检测异常，且训练数据可能包含异常样本。传统知识蒸馏方法在这种设置下容易让学生模型学习到教师模型对异常的表征，导致检测性能下降。

Method: 提出跨域蒸馏(CDD)框架：1)域特定训练：将训练集划分为多个低异常比域，为每个域训练特定学生模型；2)跨域知识聚合：利用域特定学生生成的伪正常特征协同指导全局学生学习跨样本的广义正常表征。

Result: 在MVTec AD和VisA数据集的噪声版本上实验表明，该方法相比基线取得了显著的性能提升，验证了其在FUAD设置下的有效性。

Conclusion: CDD框架通过域划分和跨域知识聚合，有效解决了完全无监督异常检测中训练数据包含异常样本的挑战，为FUAD任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Fully Unsupervised Anomaly Detection (FUAD) is a practical extension of
Unsupervised Anomaly Detection (UAD), aiming to detect anomalies without any
labels even when the training set may contain anomalous samples. To achieve
FUAD, we pioneer the introduction of Knowledge Distillation (KD) paradigm based
on teacher-student framework into the FUAD setting. However, due to the
presence of anomalies in the training data, traditional KD methods risk
enabling the student to learn the teacher's representation of anomalies under
FUAD setting, thereby resulting in poor anomaly detection performance. To
address this issue, we propose a novel Cross-Domain Distillation (CDD)
framework based on the widely studied reverse distillation (RD) paradigm.
Specifically, we design a Domain-Specific Training, which divides the training
set into multiple domains with lower anomaly ratios and train a domain-specific
student for each. Cross-Domain Knowledge Aggregation is then performed, where
pseudo-normal features generated by domain-specific students collaboratively
guide a global student to learn generalized normal representations across all
samples. Experimental results on noisy versions of the MVTec AD and VisA
datasets demonstrate that our method achieves significant performance
improvements over the baseline, validating its effectiveness under FUAD
setting.

Abstract: Visual Anomaly Detection (VAD) seeks to identify abnormal images and
precisely localize the corresponding anomalous regions, relying solely on
normal data during training. This approach has proven essential in domains such
as manufacturing and, more recently, in the medical field, where accurate and
explainable detection is critical. Despite its importance, the impact of
evolving input data distributions over time has received limited attention,
even though such changes can significantly degrade model performance. In
particular, given the dynamic and evolving nature of medical imaging data,
Continual Learning (CL) provides a natural and effective framework to
incrementally adapt models while preserving previously acquired knowledge. This
study explores for the first time the application of VAD models in a CL
scenario for the medical field. In this work, we utilize a CL version of the
well-established PatchCore model, called PatchCoreCL, and evaluate its
performance using BMAD, a real-world medical imaging dataset with both
image-level and pixel-level annotations. Our results demonstrate that
PatchCoreCL is an effective solution, achieving performance comparable to the
task-specific models, with a forgetting value less than a 1%, highlighting the
feasibility and potential of CL for adaptive VAD in medical imaging.

Conclusion: 这是首次使用生成模型从2D X光片重建人脸，为法医识别提供了一种新的、高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Craniofacial reconstruction in forensics is one of the processes to identify
victims of crime and natural disasters. Identifying an individual from their
remains plays a crucial role when all other identification methods fail.
Traditional methods for this task, such as clay-based craniofacial
reconstruction, require expert domain knowledge and are a time-consuming
process. At the same time, other probabilistic generative models like the
statistical shape model or the Basel face model fail to capture the skull and
face cross-domain attributes. Looking at these limitations, we propose a
generic framework for craniofacial reconstruction from 2D X-ray images. Here,
we used various generative models (i.e., CycleGANs, cGANs, etc) and fine-tune
the generator and discriminator parts to generate more realistic images in two
distinct domains, which are the skull and face of an individual. This is the
first time where 2D X-rays are being used as a representation of the skull by
generative models for craniofacial reconstruction. We have evaluated the
quality of generated faces using FID, IS, and SSIM scores. Finally, we have
proposed a retrieval framework where the query is the generated face image and
the gallery is the database of real faces. By experimental results, we have
found that this can be an effective tool for forensic science.

TL;DR: 提出了Visual-CoG范式，通过三阶段推理和阶段感知奖励机制，解决了现有文本到图像生成模型在多属性和模糊提示处理上的局限性，在多个基准测试中显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自回归文本到图像生成模型在处理多属性和模糊提示时能力有限，且大多数模型只在生成阶段结束时提供奖励信号，难以识别哪些阶段对最终结果有积极贡献，导致策略次优。

Method: 提出Visual-CoG范式，包含语义推理、过程精炼和结果评估三个阶段，通过阶段感知奖励在整个图像生成流程中提供即时指导。构建了视觉认知基准VisCog-Bench来评估语义推理效果。

Result: 在GenEval、T2I-CompBench和VisCog-Bench基准测试上分别实现了15%、5%和19%的性能提升，证明了Visual-CoG的优越性能。

Conclusion: Visual-CoG通过阶段感知奖励机制和多阶段推理框架，有效提升了文本到图像生成模型处理复杂提示的能力，为视觉内容生成提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Despite the promising progress of recent autoregressive models in
text-to-image (T2I) generation, their ability to handle multi-attribute and
ambiguous prompts remains limited. To address these limitations, existing works
have applied chain-of-thought (CoT) to enable stage-aware visual synthesis and
employed reinforcement learning (RL) to improve reasoning capabilities.
However, most models provide reward signals only at the end of the generation
stage. This monolithic final-only guidance makes it difficult to identify which
stages contribute positively to the final outcome and may lead to suboptimal
policies. To tackle this issue, we propose a Visual-Chain of Guidance
(Visual-CoG) paradigm consisting of three stages: semantic reasoning, process
refining, and outcome evaluation, with stage-aware rewards providing immediate
guidance throughout the image generation pipeline. We further construct a
visual cognition benchmark, VisCog-Bench, which comprises four subtasks to
evaluate the effectiveness of semantic reasoning. Comprehensive evaluations on
GenEval, T2I-CompBench, and the proposed VisCog-Bench show improvements of 15%,
5%, and 19%, respectively, demonstrating the superior performance of the
proposed Visual-CoG. We will release all the resources soon.

TL;DR: ArgusCogito是一个基于视觉语言模型的零样本思维链框架，通过跨模态协同和全方位推理来解决伪装物体分割问题，在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法由于浅层特征表示、推理机制不足和跨模态整合薄弱，难以实现深度认知，导致目标分离不完整和分割不精确的问题

Method: 采用三个认知启发阶段：1)猜想阶段通过跨模态融合进行全局推理构建认知先验；2)聚焦阶段进行全方位注意力驱动扫描和聚焦推理；3)雕刻阶段通过迭代生成密集点提示逐步雕刻高保真分割掩码

Result: 在四个伪装物体分割基准和三个医学图像分割基准上的广泛评估表明，ArgusCogito实现了最先进的性能

Conclusion: 该框架展示了卓越的效能、优越的泛化能力和鲁棒性，验证了其认知启发方法的有效性

Abstract: Camouflaged Object Segmentation (COS) poses a significant challenge due to
the intrinsic high similarity between targets and backgrounds, demanding models
capable of profound holistic understanding beyond superficial cues. Prevailing
methods, often limited by shallow feature representation, inadequate reasoning
mechanisms, and weak cross-modal integration, struggle to achieve this depth of
cognition, resulting in prevalent issues like incomplete target separation and
imprecise segmentation. Inspired by the perceptual strategy of the Hundred-eyed
Giant-emphasizing holistic observation, omnidirectional focus, and intensive
scrutiny-we introduce ArgusCogito, a novel zero-shot, chain-of-thought
framework underpinned by cross-modal synergy and omnidirectional reasoning
within Vision-Language Models (VLMs). ArgusCogito orchestrates three
cognitively-inspired stages: (1) Conjecture: Constructs a strong cognitive
prior through global reasoning with cross-modal fusion (RGB, depth, semantic
maps), enabling holistic scene understanding and enhanced target-background
disambiguation. (2) Focus: Performs omnidirectional, attention-driven scanning
and focused reasoning, guided by semantic priors from Conjecture, enabling
precise target localization and region-of-interest refinement. (3) Sculpting:
Progressively sculpts high-fidelity segmentation masks by integrating
cross-modal information and iteratively generating dense positive/negative
point prompts within focused regions, emulating Argus' intensive scrutiny.
Extensive evaluations on four challenging COS benchmarks and three Medical
Image Segmentation (MIS) benchmarks demonstrate that ArgusCogito achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, validating the framework's exceptional
efficacy, superior generalization capability, and robustness.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of remote sensing (RS) images is pivotal for
comprehensive Earth observation, but the demand for interpreting new object
categories, coupled with the high expense of manual annotation, poses
significant challenges. Although open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS)
offers a promising solution, existing frameworks designed for natural images
are insufficient for the unique complexities of RS data. They struggle with
vast scale variations and fine-grained details, and their adaptation often
relies on extensive, costly annotations. To address this critical gap, this
paper introduces SegEarth-OV, the first framework for annotation-free
open-vocabulary segmentation of RS images. Specifically, we propose SimFeatUp,
a universal upsampler that robustly restores high-resolution spatial details
from coarse features, correcting distorted target shapes without any
task-specific post-training. We also present a simple yet effective Global Bias
Alleviation operation to subtract the inherent global context from patch
features, significantly enhancing local semantic fidelity. These components
empower SegEarth-OV to effectively harness the rich semantics of pre-trained
VLMs, making OVSS possible in optical RS contexts. Furthermore, to extend the
framework's universality to other challenging RS modalities like SAR images,
where large-scale VLMs are unavailable and expensive to create, we introduce
AlignEarth, which is a distillation-based strategy and can efficiently transfer
semantic knowledge from an optical VLM encoder to an SAR encoder, bypassing the
need to build SAR foundation models from scratch and enabling universal OVSS
across diverse sensor types. Extensive experiments on both optical and SAR
datasets validate that SegEarth-OV can achieve dramatic improvements over the
SOTA methods, establishing a robust foundation for annotation-free and
open-world Earth observation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EventTracer是一个基于路径追踪的高效事件流模拟器，通过低SPP渲染和轻量级脉冲网络去噪，能够以4分钟/秒的速度生成720p高保真事件序列，显著提升了事件模拟的时空分辨率和真实性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有事件流模拟方法通常使用无噪声RGB帧，渲染成本高且时间分辨率低（100-300FPS），远低于真实事件数据。需要一种高效、物理感知的方法来生成大规模、高时间分辨率的事件数据。

Method: 采用低样本每像素（SPP）路径追踪加速渲染，训练轻量级事件脉冲网络进行去噪。网络使用双极性泄漏积分发放（BiLIF）脉冲单元和双向地球移动距离（EMD）损失来捕捉事件流的物理特性。

Result: EventTracer管道以约4分钟/秒的速度生成720p视频，在时空建模准确性方面优于其他事件模拟器，在细节捕捉和与真实事件数据相似性方面表现更好。

Conclusion: EventTracer是创建大规模事件-RGB数据集的有前途工具，能够缩小事件视觉的模拟-真实差距，促进机器人、自动驾驶和VR/AR等应用场景的发展。

Abstract: Simulating event streams from 3D scenes has become a common practice in
event-based vision research, as it meets the demand for large-scale, high
temporal frequency data without setting up expensive hardware devices or
undertaking extensive data collections. Yet existing methods in this direction
typically work with noiseless RGB frames that are costly to render, and
therefore they can only achieve a temporal resolution equivalent to 100-300
FPS, far lower than that of real-world event data. In this work, we propose
EventTracer, a path tracing-based rendering pipeline that simulates
high-fidelity event sequences from complex 3D scenes in an efficient and
physics-aware manner. Specifically, we speed up the rendering process via low
sample-per-pixel (SPP) path tracing, and train a lightweight event spiking
network to denoise the resulting RGB videos into realistic event sequences. To
capture the physical properties of event streams, the network is equipped with
a bipolar leaky integrate-and-fired (BiLIF) spiking unit and trained with a
bidirectional earth mover distance (EMD) loss. Our EventTracer pipeline runs at
a speed of about 4 minutes per second of 720p video, and it inherits the merit
of accurate spatiotemporal modeling from its path tracing backbone. We show in
two downstream tasks that EventTracer captures better scene details and
demonstrates a greater similarity to real-world event data than other event
simulators, which establishes it as a promising tool for creating large-scale
event-RGB datasets at a low cost, narrowing the sim-to-real gap in event-based
vision, and boosting various application scenarios such as robotics, autonomous
driving, and VRAR.

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够有效解决开集少样本高光谱图像分类问题，不仅能拒绝未知类别，还能进一步发现和识别未知类别。

Abstract: Open-set few-shot hyperspectral image (HSI) classification aims to classify
image pixels by using few labeled pixels per class, where the pixels to be
classified may be not all from the classes that have been seen. To address the
open-set HSI classification challenge, current methods focus mainly on
distinguishing the unknown class samples from the known class samples and
rejecting them to increase the accuracy of identifying known class samples.
They fails to further identify or discovery the unknow classes among the
samples. This paper proposes a prototype learning and clustering method for
discoverying unknown classes in HSIs under the few-shot environment. Using few
labeled samples, it strives to develop the ability of infering the prototypes
of unknown classes while distinguishing unknown classes from known classes.
Once the unknown class samples are rejected by the learned known class
classifier, the proposed method can further cluster the unknown class samples
into different classes according to their distance to the inferred unknown
class prototypes. Compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, extensive
experiments on four benchmark HSI datasets demonstrate that our proposed method
exhibits competitive performance in open-set few-shot HSI classification tasks.

Motivation: 统一基于分数的生成模型(SGMs/Diffusion模型)和薛定谔桥(SB)问题，解决SB模型训练效率低和不稳定的问题，同时充分利用预训练SGMs的优势。

Method: 提出了三种重参数化技术：迭代比例均值匹配(IPMM)、迭代比例终点匹配(IPTM)和迭代比例流匹配(IPFM)，以及使用预训练SGMs初始化SB模型的策略。

Result: 实验证明所提方法显著有效，不仅加速和稳定了SB模型的训练，还进一步提升了SGMs的性能。

Conclusion: 这项工作为生成模型的未来研究做出了贡献并铺平了道路，成功统一了SGMs和SB问题，实现了两者的优势互补。

Abstract: This paper aims to unify Score-based Generative Models (SGMs), also known as
Diffusion models, and the Schr\"odinger Bridge (SB) problem through three
reparameterization techniques: Iterative Proportional Mean-Matching (IPMM),
Iterative Proportional Terminus-Matching (IPTM), and Iterative Proportional
Flow-Matching (IPFM). These techniques significantly accelerate and stabilize
the training of SB-based models. Furthermore, the paper introduces novel
initialization strategies that use pre-trained SGMs to effectively train
SB-based models. By using SGMs as initialization, we leverage the advantages of
both SB-based models and SGMs, ensuring efficient training of SB-based models
and further improving the performance of SGMs. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the significant effectiveness and improvements of the proposed
methods. We believe this work contributes to and paves the way for future
research on generative models.

Motivation: CAM是深度学习模型可视化的重要方法，但其对不同噪声的鲁棒性尚未得到充分探索，需要系统评估各种CAM方法在不同噪声扰动下的表现。

Method: 通过分析不同类型噪声对CAM解释的影响，评估其噪声敏感性；提出包含一致性和响应性两个关键属性的鲁棒性度量指标，并在多个架构和数据集上进行实证评估。

Result: 研究发现不同CAM方法对噪声敏感性存在显著差异；提出的鲁棒性度量指标能够有效捕捉CAM方法在噪声扰动下的稳定性表现。

Conclusion: CAM方法对噪声的鲁棒性存在较大差异，需要开发更稳健的可解释性方法；提出的鲁棒性度量指标为评估CAM方法提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Class Activation Maps (CAMs) are one of the important methods for visualizing
regions used by deep learning models. Yet their robustness to different noise
remains underexplored. In this work, we evaluate and report the resilience of
various CAM methods for different noise perturbations across multiple
architectures and datasets. By analyzing the influence of different noise types
on CAM explanations, we assess the susceptibility to noise and the extent to
which dataset characteristics may impact explanation stability. The findings
highlight considerable variability in noise sensitivity for various CAMs. We
propose a robustness metric for CAMs that captures two key properties:
consistency and responsiveness. Consistency reflects the ability of CAMs to
remain stable under input perturbations that do not alter the predicted class,
while responsiveness measures the sensitivity of CAMs to changes in the
prediction caused by such perturbations. The metric is evaluated empirically
across models, different perturbations, and datasets along with complementary
statistical tests to exemplify the applicability of our proposed approach.

Conclusion: SpotEdit提供了一个全面的评估框架，揭示了当前视觉引导图像编辑模型的局限性，特别是在幻觉问题上的挑战，为未来研究提供了重要基准。

Abstract: Visually-guided image editing, where edits are conditioned on both visual
cues and textual prompts, has emerged as a powerful paradigm for fine-grained,
controllable content generation. Although recent generative models have shown
remarkable capabilities, existing evaluations remain simple and insufficiently
representative of real-world editing challenges. We present SpotEdit, a
comprehensive benchmark designed to systematically assess visually-guided image
editing methods across diverse diffusion, autoregressive, and hybrid generative
models, uncovering substantial performance disparities. To address a critical
yet underexplored challenge, our benchmark includes a dedicated component on
hallucination, highlighting how leading models, such as GPT-4o, often
hallucinate the existence of a visual cue and erroneously perform the editing
task. Our code and benchmark are publicly released at

Abstract: Large annotated datasets are vital for training segmentation models, but
pixel-level labeling is time-consuming, error-prone, and often requires scarce
expert annotators, especially in medical imaging. In contrast, coarse
annotations are quicker, cheaper, and easier to produce, even by non-experts.
In this paper, we propose to use coarse drawings from both positive (target)
and negative (background) classes in the image, even with noisy pixels, to
train a convolutional neural network (CNN) for semantic segmentation. We
present a method for learning the true segmentation label distributions from
purely noisy coarse annotations using two coupled CNNs. The separation of the
two CNNs is achieved by high fidelity with the characters of the noisy training
annotations. We propose to add a complementary label learning that encourages
estimating negative label distribution. To illustrate the properties of our
method, we first use a toy segmentation dataset based on MNIST. We then present
the quantitative results of experiments using publicly available datasets:
Cityscapes dataset for multi-class segmentation, and retinal images for medical
applications. In all experiments, our method outperforms state-of-the-art
methods, particularly in the cases where the ratio of coarse annotations is
small compared to the given dense annotations.

Conclusion: 该研究成功解决了脑信号衰减带来的偏置问题，提出的BRAIN方法能有效缓解表示偏移并保持模型性能，为视觉-脑理解领域提供了重要解决方案。

Abstract: Memory decay makes it harder for the human brain to recognize visual objects
and retain details. Consequently, recorded brain signals become weaker,
uncertain, and contain poor visual context over time. This paper presents one
of the first vision-learning approaches to address this problem. First, we
statistically and experimentally demonstrate the existence of inconsistency in
brain signals and its impact on the Vision-Brain Understanding (VBU) model. Our
findings show that brain signal representations shift over recording sessions,
leading to compounding bias, which poses challenges for model learning and
degrades performance. Then, we propose a new Bias-Mitigation Continual Learning
(BRAIN) approach to address these limitations. In this approach, the model is
trained in a continual learning setup and mitigates the growing bias from each
learning step. A new loss function named De-bias Contrastive Learning is also
introduced to address the bias problem. In addition, to prevent catastrophic
forgetting, where the model loses knowledge from previous sessions, the new
Angular-based Forgetting Mitigation approach is introduced to preserve learned
knowledge in the model. Finally, the empirical experiments demonstrate that our
approach achieves State-of-the-Art (SOTA) performance across various
benchmarks, surpassing prior and non-continual learning methods.

Abstract: Deep learning has transformed computer vision (CV), achieving outstanding
performance in classification, segmentation, and related tasks. Such AI-based
CV systems are becoming prevalent, with applications spanning from medical
imaging to surveillance. State of the art models such as convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs) are often regarded as ``black
boxes,'' offering limited transparency into their decision-making processes.
Despite a recent advancement in explainable AI (XAI), explainability remains
underutilized in practical CV deployments. A primary obstacle is the absence of
integrated software solutions that connect XAI techniques with robust knowledge
management and monitoring frameworks. To close this gap, we have developed Obz
AI, a comprehensive software ecosystem designed to facilitate state-of-the-art
explainability and observability for vision AI systems. Obz AI provides a
seamless integration pipeline, from a Python client library to a full-stack
analytics dashboard. With Obz AI, a machine learning engineer can easily
incorporate advanced XAI methodologies, extract and analyze features for
outlier detection, and continuously monitor AI models in real time. By making
the decision-making mechanisms of deep models interpretable, Obz AI promotes

Motivation: 现有方法依赖大量后处理或产生低质量重建，需要直接从扩散过程生成高质量物体几何并确保合理的手-物体交互

Method: 使用潜在扩散模型，以修复后的物体外观为条件，采用推理时指导优化重建。通过速度场监督和多模态几何线索（法线深度对齐、轮廓一致性、2D关键点重投影）同时优化手和物体的变换，并加入符号距离场监督以及接触和非相交约束

Result: 在遮挡情况下产生准确、鲁棒和一致的重建结果，在野外场景中泛化良好

Conclusion: 该方法通过扩散过程中的优化指导设计，直接生成高质量物体几何，确保了物理合理的手-物体交互，优于现有方法

Abstract: We propose a novel diffusion-based framework for reconstructing 3D geometry
of hand-held objects from monocular RGB images by leveraging hand-object
interaction as geometric guidance. Our method conditions a latent diffusion
model on an inpainted object appearance and uses inference-time guidance to
optimize the object reconstruction, while simultaneously ensuring plausible
hand-object interactions. Unlike prior methods that rely on extensive
post-processing or produce low-quality reconstructions, our approach directly
generates high-quality object geometry during the diffusion process by
introducing guidance with an optimization-in-the-loop design. Specifically, we
guide the diffusion model by applying supervision to the velocity field while
simultaneously optimizing the transformations of both the hand and the object
being reconstructed. This optimization is driven by multi-modal geometric cues,
including normal and depth alignment, silhouette consistency, and 2D keypoint
reprojection. We further incorporate signed distance field supervision and
enforce contact and non-intersection constraints to ensure physical
plausibility of hand-object interaction. Our method yields accurate, robust and
coherent reconstructions under occlusion while generalizing well to in-the-wild
scenarios.

TL;DR: GM-Skip是一个用于Transformer块跳过的灵活框架，通过度量引导的贪婪选择和反向删除机制，在保持输出质量的同时加速视觉语言模型的推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于Transformer的视觉语言模型虽然性能出色，但计算成本高，阻碍了在自动驾驶等延迟敏感应用中的部署。需要一种方法在保持性能的同时加速推理。

Method: 采用贪婪的度量引导块选择策略，利用度量反馈识别冗余层，结合反向顺序删除机制保留早期基础块，并通过可调节的稀疏度-性能平衡目标支持不同部署需求。

Result: 在COCO数据集上，GM-Skip将Person类别的单目标分类准确率从19.1%提升到87.3%，同时跳过超过40%的Transformer块。在自动驾驶系统中实现高达45.4%的延迟降低。

Conclusion: GM-Skip框架有效加速了视觉语言模型的推理速度，在多个任务和数据集上保持性能的同时显著减少计算延迟，具有实际部署价值。

Abstract: Transformer-based Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive
performance on tasks such as image captioning, object recognition, and visual
reasoning, but their high computational cost hinders deployment in
latency-sensitive applications like autonomous driving. We introduce GM-Skip, a
flexible and metric-adaptive framework for Transformer block skipping that
accelerates VLM inference while preserving output quality. GM-Skip features a
greedy, metric-guided block selection strategy that uses metric feedback (e.g.,
accuracy, CIDEr) to identify redundant layers, along with a reverse-order
deletion mechanism that preserves early foundational blocks to avoid
performance collapse. To support diverse deployment needs, it incorporates a
tunable trade-off between sparsity and performance via a score-sparsity balance
objective. Experiments across multiple tasks and datasets, including COCO and
CODA, show that GM-Skip consistently improves inference speed while maintaining
task performance. On the COCO dataset, GM-Skip improves single-object
classification accuracy on the Person category from 19.1 percent to 87.3
percent while skipping more than 40 percent of Transformer blocks. In
real-world deployment, it achieves up to 45.4 percent latency reduction on
single-object detection when integrated into an autonomous vehicle running
Autoware.Universe, validating the effectiveness of its skip configurations and
confirming its practical value in accelerating real-world inference.

TL;DR: SKD-CAG方法通过自知识蒸馏和交叉注意力引导，有效消除文本到图像扩散模型中的后门攻击，在保持图像质量的同时实现高精度后门移除。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像扩散模型存在后门攻击漏洞，攻击者可通过注入不可见的文本触发器操纵模型输出。虽然分类模型中的文本后门防御已有研究，但生成模型缺乏有效的缓解技术。

Method: 提出自知识蒸馏与交叉注意力引导(SKD-CAG)方法，利用知识蒸馏指导模型修正对中毒提示的响应，通过交叉注意力机制在注意力层面消除后门影响，同时保持模型在无触发器时生成干净输出的能力。

Result: 实验表明该方法显著优于现有方法，对像素后门实现100%移除准确率，对基于风格的攻击达到93%准确率，且不牺牲鲁棒性或图像保真度。

Conclusion: 定向遗忘是保护生成模型安全的有前景的防御策略，SKD-CAG方法为文本到图像扩散模型提供了有效的后门防御解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have revolutionized generative AI, but their
vulnerability to backdoor attacks poses significant security risks. Adversaries
can inject imperceptible textual triggers into training data, causing models to
generate manipulated outputs. Although text-based backdoor defenses in
classification models are well-explored, generative models lack effective
mitigation techniques against. We address this by selectively erasing the
model's learned associations between adversarial text triggers and poisoned
outputs, while preserving overall generation quality. Our approach,
Self-Knowledge Distillation with Cross-Attention Guidance (SKD-CAG), uses
knowledge distillation to guide the model in correcting responses to poisoned
prompts while maintaining image quality by exploiting the fact that the
backdoored model still produces clean outputs in the absence of triggers. Using
the cross-attention mechanism, SKD-CAG neutralizes backdoor influences at the
attention level, ensuring the targeted removal of adversarial effects.
Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms existing approaches,
achieving removal accuracy 100\% for pixel backdoors and 93\% for style-based
attacks, without sacrificing robustness or image fidelity. Our findings
highlight targeted unlearning as a promising defense to secure generative
models. Code and model weights can be found at

TL;DR: LanSE是一个新颖的评估框架，通过识别可解释的视觉模式并用自然语言描述，为AI生成图像提供细粒度评估，解决了现有评估指标过于粗糙的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI生成内容（如合成图像）质量显著提升，但现有评估指标只能提供粗粒度评估，无法识别具体优缺点，限制了模型选择和科学理解。

Method: 提出Language-Grounded Sparse Encoders (LanSE)架构，通过大规模人工评估（超过11,000个标注）和多模态模型分析，识别可解释的视觉模式。

Result: LanSE在自然图像中检测可解释视觉模式的准确率超过93%，能够量化提示匹配、视觉真实感、物理合理性和内容多样性四个关键维度，揭示现有指标无法发现的模型差异。

Conclusion: LanSE通过将可解释性与实际评估需求结合，为生成式AI模型用户提供了强大的模型选择、合成内容质量控制和模型改进工具，有助于建立公众对AI生成内容的信心和安全。

Abstract: While the quality of AI-generated contents, such as synthetic images, has
become remarkably high, current evaluation metrics provide only coarse-grained
assessments, failing to identify specific strengths and weaknesses that
researchers and practitioners need for model selection and development, further
limiting the scientific understanding and commercial deployment of these
generative models. To address this, we introduce Language-Grounded Sparse
Encoders (LanSE), a novel architecture that creates interpretable evaluation
metrics by identifying interpretable visual patterns and automatically
describing them in natural language. Through large-scale human evaluation (more
than 11,000 annotations) and large multimodal model (LMM) based analysis, LanSE
demonstrates reliable capabilities to detect interpretable visual patterns in
synthetic images with more than 93\% accuracy in natural images. LanSE further
provides a fine-grained evaluation framework that quantifies four key
dimensions of generation quality, prompt match, visual realism, physical
plausibility, and content diversity. LanSE reveals nuanced model differences
invisible to existing metrics, for instance, FLUX's superior physical
plausibility and SDXL-medium's strong content diversity, while aligning with
human judgments. By bridging interpretability with practical evaluation needs,
LanSE offers all users of generative AI models a powerful tool for model
selection, quality control of synthetic content, and model improvement. These
capabilities directly address the need for public confidence and safety in
AI-generated content, both critical for the future of generative AI
applications.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种轻量化的Transformer基础的3D人体姿势采集器，能够在即时性和计算成本上实现更优的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统方法在缺少相机参数或身体线段长度优先知识时性能下降的问题，并提供一个能适应不同部署场景的统一模型。

Method: 使用插入机制让模型在训练和推理时忽略缺失的优先知识，基于AMASS数据集生成二维合成数据进行训练，并与仅在完整优先知识上训练的专家模型进行对比。

Result: 相机和身体线段长度优先知识都能提升性能，多用途模型在所有情况下都超过专家模型，平均3D关节点位置误差仅36mm，计算效率高（GPU 380μs，CPU 1800μs）。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持高精度的同时显著降低了计算成本，适合在嵌入式平台和低功耗设备上部署，为单目摄像头3D人体姿势采集提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: This paper proposes a new lightweight Transformer-based lifter that maps
short sequences of human 2D joint positions to 3D poses using a single camera.
The proposed model takes as input geometric priors including segment lengths
and camera intrinsics and is designed to operate in both calibrated and
uncalibrated settings. To this end, a masking mechanism enables the model to
ignore missing priors during training and inference. This yields a single
versatile network that can adapt to different deployment scenarios, from fully
calibrated lab environments to in-the-wild monocular videos without
calibration. The model was trained using 3D keypoints from AMASS dataset with
corresponding 2D synthetic data generated by sampling random camera poses and
intrinsics. It was then compared to an expert model trained, only on complete
priors, and the validation was done by conducting an ablation study. Results
show that both, camera and segment length priors, improve performance and that
the versatile model outperforms the expert, even when all priors are available,
and maintains high accuracy when priors are missing. Overall the average 3D
joint center positions estimation accuracy was as low as 36mm improving state
of the art by half a centimeter and at a much lower computational cost. Indeed,
the proposed model runs in 380$\mu$s on GPU and 1800$\mu$s on CPU, making it
suitable for deployment on embedded platforms and low-power devices.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GSVisLoc是一种基于3D高斯泼溅(3DGS)场景表示的视觉定位方法，通过粗匹配、精匹配和姿态细化三个步骤，实现从查询图像到3D场景的相机位姿估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉定位方法通常需要修改、重新训练或额外的参考图像，而GSVisLoc旨在利用3DGS的显式场景表示，无需这些额外步骤就能实现有效的视觉定位。

Method: 方法包括三个步骤：1)粗匹配-对3D高斯进行下采样和编码生成场景特征；2)精匹配-编码图像块获取图像特征并进行鲁棒匹配；3)姿态细化-通过优化获得准确的最终位姿估计。

Result: 在室内外场景的标准基准测试中表现出竞争性的定位性能，优于现有的3DGS基线方法，并且能够有效泛化到新场景而无需额外训练。

Conclusion: GSVisLoc成功证明了利用3DGS显式表示进行视觉定位的可行性，为3D场景表示在定位任务中的应用提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce GSVisLoc, a visual localization method designed for 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) scene representations. Given a 3DGS model of a scene and a
query image, our goal is to estimate the camera's position and orientation. We
accomplish this by robustly matching scene features to image features. Scene
features are produced by downsampling and encoding the 3D Gaussians while image
features are obtained by encoding image patches. Our algorithm proceeds in
three steps, starting with coarse matching, then fine matching, and finally by
applying pose refinement for an accurate final estimate. Importantly, our
method leverages the explicit 3DGS scene representation for visual localization
without requiring modifications, retraining, or additional reference images. We
evaluate GSVisLoc on both indoor and outdoor scenes, demonstrating competitive
localization performance on standard benchmarks while outperforming existing
3DGS-based baselines. Moreover, our approach generalizes effectively to novel
scenes without additional training.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出MMTok方法，利用视觉和文本token的覆盖度准则来选择信息丰富的视觉token，提高视觉语言模型的推理效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要使用单模态信息进行视觉token剪枝，忽略了视觉语言任务的多模态特性，且缺乏适用于不同模态的通用准则

Method: 将子集选择问题建模为最大覆盖问题，优化视觉token子集同时覆盖文本token和原始视觉token集，并使用VLM代理改进文本token质量来指导视觉剪枝

Result: 在POPE数据集上实现1.87倍加速同时保持98.7%原始性能；仅用4个视觉token仍保留LLaVA-1.5-7B模型87.7%的原始性能

Conclusion: 视觉和文本信息具有互补性，多模态信息结合能显著超越单模态基线，覆盖度准则在token选择中非常有效

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate impressive performance in
understanding visual content with language instruction by converting visual
input to vision tokens. However, redundancy in vision tokens results in the
degenerated inference efficiency of VLMs. While many algorithms have been
proposed to reduce the number of vision tokens, most of them apply only
unimodal information (i.e., vision/text) for pruning and ignore the inherent
multimodal property of vision-language tasks. Moreover, it lacks a generic
criterion that can be applied to different modalities. To mitigate this
limitation, in this work, we propose to leverage both vision and text tokens to
select informative vision tokens by the criterion of coverage. We first
formulate the subset selection problem as a maximum coverage problem.
Afterward, a subset of vision tokens is optimized to cover the text tokens and
the original set of vision tokens, simultaneously. Finally, a VLM agent can be
adopted to further improve the quality of text tokens for guiding vision
pruning. The proposed method MMTok is extensively evaluated on benchmark
datasets with different VLMs. The comparison illustrates that vision and text
information are complementary, and combining multimodal information can surpass
the unimodal baseline with a clear margin. Moreover, under the maximum coverage
criterion on the POPE dataset, our method achieves a 1.87x speedup while
maintaining 98.7% of the original performance on LLaVA-NeXT-13B. Furthermore,
with only four vision tokens, it still preserves 87.7% of the original
performance on LLaVA-1.5-7B. These results highlight the effectiveness of
coverage in token selection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发更先进的开源多模态模型，提升推理能力、效率和多功能性，缩小与商业模型如GPT-5的性能差距。

Method: 采用级联强化学习框架（离线RL稳定收敛+在线RL精细对齐）、视觉分辨率路由器动态调整视觉token分辨率、解耦视觉-语言部署策略分离编码器和语言模型。

Result: 在MMMU和MathVista等下游推理任务上显著提升，总体推理性能提升16%，推理速度加快4.05倍，最大模型在开源MLLM中达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: InternVL 3.5通过创新的训练框架和效率优化技术，实现了性能与效率的双重突破，为开源多模态模型树立了新标杆，并支持GUI交互和具身代理等新能力。

Abstract: We introduce InternVL 3.5, a new family of open-source multimodal models that
significantly advances versatility, reasoning capability, and inference
efficiency along the InternVL series. A key innovation is the Cascade
Reinforcement Learning (Cascade RL) framework, which enhances reasoning through
a two-stage process: offline RL for stable convergence and online RL for
refined alignment. This coarse-to-fine training strategy leads to substantial
improvements on downstream reasoning tasks, e.g., MMMU and MathVista. To
optimize efficiency, we propose a Visual Resolution Router (ViR) that
dynamically adjusts the resolution of visual tokens without compromising
performance. Coupled with ViR, our Decoupled Vision-Language Deployment (DvD)
strategy separates the vision encoder and language model across different GPUs,
effectively balancing computational load. These contributions collectively
enable InternVL3.5 to achieve up to a +16.0\% gain in overall reasoning
performance and a 4.05$\times$ inference speedup compared to its predecessor,
i.e., InternVL3. In addition, InternVL3.5 supports novel capabilities such as
GUI interaction and embodied agency. Notably, our largest model, i.e.,
InternVL3.5-241B-A28B, attains state-of-the-art results among open-source MLLMs
across general multimodal, reasoning, text, and agentic tasks -- narrowing the
performance gap with leading commercial models like GPT-5. All models and code
are publicly released.

TL;DR: ObjFiller-3D是一种新颖的3D修复方法，通过利用视频编辑模型而非传统2D图像修复模型，解决了多视角2D图像修复中的一致性问题，实现了高质量、一致的3D对象补全和编辑。


<details>

Motivation: 现有的3D修复方法依赖于多视角2D图像修复，但不同修复视图之间的不一致性会导致模糊纹理、空间不连续和视觉伪影，严重影响3D对象补全的准确性和真实感。

Method: 提出ObjFiller-3D方法，使用精选的视频编辑模型来填充3D对象的掩码区域。分析了3D和视频之间的表示差距，将视频修复模型适配用于3D场景修复，并引入基于参考的3D修复方法以进一步提升重建质量。

Conclusion: ObjFiller-3D通过创新的视频模型适配方法，有效解决了3D修复中的一致性问题，为高质量3D对象补全和编辑提供了有效的解决方案，具有重要的实际应用价值。

Abstract: 3D inpainting often relies on multi-view 2D image inpainting, where the
inherent inconsistencies across different inpainted views can result in blurred
textures, spatial discontinuities, and distracting visual artifacts. These
inconsistencies pose significant challenges when striving for accurate and
realistic 3D object completion, particularly in applications that demand high
fidelity and structural coherence. To overcome these limitations, we propose
ObjFiller-3D, a novel method designed for the completion and editing of
high-quality and consistent 3D objects. Instead of employing a conventional 2D
image inpainting model, our approach leverages a curated selection of
state-of-the-art video editing model to fill in the masked regions of 3D
objects. We analyze the representation gap between 3D and videos, and propose
an adaptation of a video inpainting model for 3D scene inpainting. In addition,
we introduce a reference-based 3D inpainting method to further enhance the
quality of reconstruction. Experiments across diverse datasets show that
compared to previous methods, ObjFiller-3D produces more faithful and
fine-grained reconstructions (PSNR of 26.6 vs. NeRFiller (15.9) and LPIPS of
0.19 vs. Instant3dit (0.25)). Moreover, it demonstrates strong potential for
practical deployment in real-world 3D editing applications. Project page:

Abstract: Robotic cloth manipulation suffers from a lack of standardized benchmarks and
shared datasets for evaluating and comparing different approaches. To address
this, we created a benchmark and organized the ICRA 2024 Cloth Competition, a
unique head-to-head evaluation focused on grasp pose selection for in-air
robotic cloth unfolding. Eleven diverse teams participated in the competition,
utilizing our publicly released dataset of real-world robotic cloth unfolding
attempts and a variety of methods to design their unfolding approaches.
Afterwards, we also expanded our dataset with 176 competition evaluation
trials, resulting in a dataset of 679 unfolding demonstrations across 34
garments. Analysis of the competition results revealed insights about the
trade-off between grasp success and coverage, the surprisingly strong
achievements of hand-engineered methods and a significant discrepancy between
competition performance and prior work, underscoring the importance of
independent, out-of-the-lab evaluation in robotic cloth manipulation. The
associated dataset is a valuable resource for developing and evaluating grasp
selection methods, particularly for learning-based approaches. We hope that our

benchmarks and drive further progress in data-driven robotic cloth
manipulation. The dataset and benchmarking code are available at

Method: 使用Genesis仿真环境中的程序生成管道环境，设计奖励函数引导无人机通过航点，对碰撞施加重罚，比较PPO和SAC算法

Conclusion: 在危险密集导航中，on-policy方法的训练稳定性优于off-policy算法的样本效率；程序生成的高保真仿真是开发和基准测试导航策略的有效平台

Abstract: Inspecting confined industrial infrastructure, such as ventilation shafts, is
a hazardous and inefficient task for humans. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)
offer a promising alternative, but GPS-denied environments require robust
control policies to prevent collisions. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has
emerged as a powerful framework for developing such policies, and this paper
provides a comparative study of two leading DRL algorithms for this task: the
on-policy Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and the off-policy Soft
Actor-Critic (SAC). The training was conducted with procedurally generated duct
environments in Genesis simulation environment. A reward function was designed
to guide a drone through a series of waypoints while applying a significant
penalty for collisions. PPO learned a stable policy that completed all
evaluation episodes without collision, producing smooth trajectories. By
contrast, SAC consistently converged to a suboptimal behavior that traversed
only the initial segments before failure. These results suggest that, in
hazard-dense navigation, the training stability of on-policy methods can
outweigh the nominal sample efficiency of off-policy algorithms. More broadly,
the study provides evidence that procedurally generated, high-fidelity
simulations are effective testbeds for developing and benchmarking robust
navigation policies.

Abstract: The fast development of technology and artificial intelligence has
significantly advanced Autonomous Vehicle (AV) research, emphasizing the need
for extensive simulation testing. Accurate and adaptable maps are critical in
AV development, serving as the foundation for localization, path planning, and
scenario testing. However, creating simulation-ready maps is often difficult
and resource-intensive, especially with simulators like CARLA (CAR Learning to
Act). Many existing workflows require significant computational resources or
rely on specific simulators, limiting flexibility for developers. This paper
presents a custom workflow to streamline map creation for AV development,
demonstrated through the generation of a 3D map of a parking lot at Ontario
Tech University. Future work will focus on incorporating SLAM technologies,
optimizing the workflow for broader simulator compatibility, and exploring more
flexible handling of latitude and longitude values to enhance map generation
accuracy.

Motivation: 水下近距离操作中，由于缺乏目标侧本体感知，可用的相对观测稀疏、噪声大且通常不完整（如USBL位置），导致因子图最大后验估计在无运动先验时欠约束，连续目标状态关联弱且姿态容易漂移。

Method: 提出广义常扭运动先验，定义在李群切空间上，通过SE(3)中的三元因子实现平移和旋转的体坐标系耦合，推导了闭式雅可比矩阵，支持任意李群轨迹的即插即用。评估了两种部署模式：纯SE(3)表示和带边界因子的混合表示模式。

Result: 在真实动态对接场景数据集上的验证表明，该方法能够通过USBL-only和光学相对测量段实现一致的自我-目标轨迹估计，相比噪声测量提高了相对跟踪精度。

Conclusion: 该方法基于标准李群原语构建，具有跨状态流形和传感模态的可移植性，为水下6-DoF运动估计提供了有效的运动先验约束解决方案。

Abstract: Estimating a target's 6-DoF motion in underwater proximity operations is
difficult because the chaser lacks target-side proprioception and the available
relative observations are sparse, noisy, and often partial (e.g., Ultra-Short
Baseline (USBL) positions). Without a motion prior, factor-graph maximum a
posteriori estimation is underconstrained: consecutive target states are weakly
linked and orientation can drift. We propose a generalized constant-twist
motion prior defined on the tangent space of Lie groups that enforces
temporally consistent trajectories across all degrees of freedom; in SE(3) it
couples translation and rotation in the body frame. We present a ternary factor
and derive its closed-form Jacobians based on standard Lie group operations,
enabling drop-in use for trajectories on arbitrary Lie groups. We evaluate two
deployment modes: (A) an SE(3)-only representation that regularizes orientation
even when only position is measured, and (B) a mode with boundary factors that
switches the target representation between SE(3) and 3D position while applying
the same generalized constant-twist prior across representation changes.
Validation on a real-world dynamic docking scenario dataset shows consistent
ego-target trajectory estimation through USBL-only and optical relative
measurement segments with an improved relative tracking accuracy compared to
the noisy measurements to the target. Because the construction relies on
standard Lie group primitives, it is portable across state manifolds and
sensing modalities.

Conclusion: 这项工作代表了向能够在真实世界感官约束下执行复杂顺序任务的鲁棒通用人形智能体迈出的关键一步。

Abstract: We introduce HumanoidVerse, a novel framework for vision-language guided
humanoid control that enables a single physically simulated robot to perform
long-horizon, multi-object rearrangement tasks across diverse scenes. Unlike
prior methods that operate in fixed settings with single-object interactions,
our approach supports consecutive manipulation of multiple objects, guided only
by natural language instructions and egocentric camera RGB observations.
HumanoidVerse is trained via a multi-stage curriculum using a dual-teacher
distillation pipeline, enabling fluid transitions between sub-tasks without
requiring environment resets. To support this, we construct a large-scale
dataset comprising 350 multi-object tasks spanning four room layouts. Extensive
experiments in the Isaac Gym simulator demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art in both task success rate and
spatial precision, and generalizes well to unseen environments and
instructions. Our work represents a key step toward robust, general-purpose
humanoid agents capable of executing complex, sequential tasks under real-world
sensory constraints. The video visualization results can be found on the

Abstract: Recent advances in motion planning for autonomous driving have led to models
capable of generating high-quality trajectories. However, most existing
planners tend to fix their policy after supervised training, leading to
consistent but rigid driving behaviors. This limits their ability to reflect
human preferences or adapt to dynamic, instruction-driven demands. In this
work, we propose a diffusion-based multi-head trajectory planner(M-diffusion
planner). During the early training stage, all output heads share weights to
learn to generate high-quality trajectories. Leveraging the probabilistic
nature of diffusion models, we then apply Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) to fine-tune the pre-trained model for diverse policy-specific
behaviors. At inference time, we incorporate a large language model (LLM) to
guide strategy selection, enabling dynamic, instruction-aware planning without
switching models. Closed-loop simulation demonstrates that our post-trained
planner retains strong planning capability while achieving state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance on the nuPlan val14 benchmark. Open-loop results further
show that the generated trajectories exhibit clear diversity, effectively
satisfying multi-modal driving behavior requirements. The code and related
experiments will be released upon acceptance of the paper.

Conclusion: HDSim框架通过认知理论和LLM的结合，显著提升了交通模拟的真实性和多样性，为自动驾驶系统测试提供了更有效的安全性评估工具。

Abstract: Ensuring realistic traffic dynamics is a prerequisite for simulation
platforms to evaluate the reliability of self-driving systems before deployment
in the real world. Because most road users are human drivers, reproducing their
diverse behaviors within simulators is vital. Existing solutions, however,
typically rely on either handcrafted heuristics or narrow data-driven models,
which capture only fragments of real driving behaviors and offer limited
driving style diversity and interpretability. To address this gap, we introduce
HDSim, an HD traffic generation framework that combines cognitive theory with
large language model (LLM) assistance to produce scalable and realistic traffic
scenarios within simulation platforms. The framework advances the state of the
art in two ways: (i) it introduces a hierarchical driver model that represents
diverse driving style traits, and (ii) it develops a Perception-Mediated
Behavior Influence strategy, where LLMs guide perception to indirectly shape
driver actions. Experiments reveal that embedding HDSim into simulation
improves detection of safety-critical failures in self-driving systems by up to
68% and yields realism-consistent accident interpretability.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的双空间刚性配准方法，结合特征匹配和局部几何匹配的优势，通过高效过滤机制和几何代理实现快速准确的配准。


<details>

Motivation: 刚性配准在SLAM和3D重建中至关重要，但噪声数据、部分重叠和实时处理需求带来挑战。特征匹配能处理大变换但精度有限，几何匹配需要良好初始变换。

Method: 采用双空间范式：1）使用轻量级单点RANSAC算法和细化模块过滤不可靠特征对应；2）将过滤后的对应点作为锚点，提取几何代理，构建目标函数求解变换。

Result: 在KITTI数据集上实现了高达32倍的CPU时间加速，同时保持可比的精度。

Conclusion: 该方法有效结合了特征匹配和几何匹配的优势，在保持精度的同时显著提升了计算效率，适用于实时应用场景。

Abstract: Rigid registration, aiming to estimate a rigid transformation to align source
and target data, play a crucial role in applications such as SLAM and 3D
reconstruction. However, noisy, partially overlapping data and the need for
real-time processing pose major challenges for rigid registration. Considering
that feature-based matching can handle large transformation differences but
suffers from limited accuracy, while local geometry-based matching can achieve
fine-grained local alignment but relies heavily on a good initial
transformation, we propose a novel dual-space paradigm to fully leverage the
strengths of both approaches. First, we introduce an efficient filtering
mechanism that incorporates a computationally lightweight single-point RANSAC
algorithm followed by a refinement module to eliminate unreliable feature-based
correspondences. Subsequently, we treat filtered correspondences as anchor
points, extract geometric proxies, and formulates an effective objective
function with a tailored solver to estimate the transformation. Experiments
verify our method's effectiveness, as shown by achieving up to a 32x CPU-time
speedup over MAC on KITTI with comparable accuracy.

Abstract: As autonomous driving continues to advance, automated parking is becoming
increasingly essential. However, significant challenges arise when implementing
path velocity decomposition (PVD) trajectory planning for automated parking.
The primary challenge is ensuring rapid and precise collision-free trajectory
planning, which is often in conflict. The secondary challenge involves
maintaining sufficient control feasibility of the planned trajectory,
particularly at gear shifting points (GSP). This paper proposes a PVD-based
rapid iterative trajectory planning (RITP) method to solve the above
challenges. The proposed method effectively balances the necessity for time
efficiency and precise collision avoidance through a novel collision avoidance
framework. Moreover, it enhances the overall control feasibility of the planned
trajectory by incorporating the vehicle kinematics model and including terminal
smoothing constraints (TSC) at GSP during path planning. Specifically, the
proposed method leverages differential flatness to ensure the planned path
adheres to the vehicle kinematic model. Additionally, it utilizes TSC to
maintain curvature continuity at GSP, thereby enhancing the control feasibility
of the overall trajectory. The simulation results demonstrate superior time
efficiency and tracking errors compared to model-integrated and other
iteration-based trajectory planning methods. In the real-world experiment, the
proposed method was implemented and validated on a ROS-based vehicle,
demonstrating the applicability of the RITP method for real vehicles.

reduces the inductive biases introduced in the previous similar methods. We
demonstrate that a single-policy LaGarNet achieves flattening on four different
types of garments in both real-world and simulation settings.

Abstract: Brain-body co-optimization remains a challenging problem, despite increasing
interest from the community in recent years. To understand and overcome the
challenges, we propose exhaustively mapping a morphology-fitness landscape to
study it. To this end, we train controllers for each feasible morphology in a
design space of 1,305,840 distinct morphologies, constrained by a computational
budget. First, we show that this design space constitutes a good model for
studying the brain-body co-optimization problem, and our attempt to
exhaustively map it roughly captures the landscape. We then proceed to analyze
how evolutionary brain-body co-optimization algorithms work in this design
space. The complete knowledge of the morphology-fitness landscape facilitates a
better understanding of the results of evolutionary brain-body co-optimization
algorithms and how they unfold over evolutionary time in the morphology space.
This investigation shows that the experimented algorithms cannot consistently
find near-optimal solutions. The search, at times, gets stuck on morphologies
that are sometimes one mutation away from better morphologies, and the
algorithms cannot efficiently track the fitness gradient in the
morphology-fitness landscape. We provide evidence that experimented algorithms
regularly undervalue the fitness of individuals with newly mutated bodies and,
as a result, eliminate promising morphologies throughout evolution. Our work
provides the most concrete demonstration of the challenges of evolutionary
brain-body co-optimization. Our findings ground the trends in the literature
and provide valuable insights for future work.

Abstract: Quadruped robots have emerged as highly efficient and versatile platforms,
excelling in navigating complex and unstructured terrains where traditional
wheeled robots might fail. Equipping these robots with manipulator arms unlocks
the advanced capability of loco-manipulation to perform complex physical
interaction tasks in areas ranging from industrial automation to
search-and-rescue missions. However, achieving precise and adaptable grasping
in such dynamic scenarios remains a significant challenge, often hindered by
the need for extensive real-world calibration and pre-programmed grasp
configurations. This paper introduces a deep learning framework designed to
enhance the grasping capabilities of quadrupeds equipped with arms, focusing on
improved precision and adaptability. Our approach centers on a sim-to-real
methodology that minimizes reliance on physical data collection. We developed a
pipeline within the Genesis simulation environment to generate a synthetic
dataset of grasp attempts on common objects. By simulating thousands of
interactions from various perspectives, we created pixel-wise annotated
grasp-quality maps to serve as the ground truth for our model. This dataset was
used to train a custom CNN with a U-Net-like architecture that processes
multi-modal input from an onboard RGB and depth cameras, including RGB images,
depth maps, segmentation masks, and surface normal maps. The trained model
outputs a grasp-quality heatmap to identify the optimal grasp point. We
validated the complete framework on a four-legged robot. The system
successfully executed a full loco-manipulation task: autonomously navigating to
a target object, perceiving it with its sensors, predicting the optimal grasp
pose using our model, and performing a precise grasp. This work proves that
leveraging simulated training with advanced sensing offers a scalable and
effective solution for object handling.

Abstract: With the rise of modern deep learning, neural networks have become an
essential part of virtually every artificial intelligence system, making it
difficult even to imagine different models for intelligent behavior. In
contrast, nature provides us with many different mechanisms for intelligent
behavior, most of which we have yet to replicate. One of such underinvestigated
aspects of intelligence is embodiment and the role it plays in intelligent
behavior. In this work, we focus on how the simple and fixed behavior of
constituent parts of a simulated physical body can result in an emergent
behavior that can be classified as cognitive by an outside observer.
Specifically, we show how simulated voxels with fixed behaviors can be combined
to create a robot such that, when presented with an image of an MNIST digit
zero, it moves towards the left; and when it is presented with an image of an
MNIST digit one, it moves towards the right. Such robots possess what we refer
to as ``morphological cognition'' -- the ability to perform cognitive behavior
as a result of morphological processes. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first demonstration of a high-level mental faculty such as image
classification performed by a robot without any neural circuitry. We hope that
this work serves as a proof-of-concept and fosters further research into
different models of intelligence.

Abstract: Grasp synthesis is a fundamental task in robotic manipulation which usually
has multiple feasible solutions. Multimodal grasp synthesis seeks to generate
diverse sets of stable grasps conditioned on object geometry, making the robust
learning of geometric features crucial for success. To address this challenge,
we propose a framework for learning multimodal grasp distributions that
leverages variational shape inference to enhance robustness against shape noise
and measurement sparsity. Our approach first trains a variational autoencoder
for shape inference using implicit neural representations, and then uses these
learned geometric features to guide a diffusion model for grasp synthesis on
the SE(3) manifold. Additionally, we introduce a test-time grasp optimization
technique that can be integrated as a plugin to further enhance grasping
performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our shape inference for
grasp synthesis formulation outperforms state-of-the-art multimodal grasp
synthesis methods on the ACRONYM dataset by 6.3%, while demonstrating
robustness to deterioration in point cloud density compared to other
approaches. Furthermore, our trained model achieves zero-shot transfer to
real-world manipulation of household objects, generating 34% more successful
grasps than baselines despite measurement noise and point cloud calibration
errors.

TL;DR: 提出了基于高斯原语传播的3D世界模型GWM，通过扩散变换器和3D变分自编码器实现精细场景重建，在机器人操作任务中显著超越现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于图像的世界模型缺乏稳健的几何信息，无法提供一致的空间和物理理解，限制了在机器人操作任务中的性能

Method: 使用高斯原语推断机器人动作下的传播，结合潜在扩散变换器(DiT)和3D变分自编码器，通过高斯泼溅实现精细场景级未来状态重建

Result: 在仿真和真实世界实验中，GWM能够精确预测不同机器人动作条件下的未来场景，训练出的策略显著超越现有最先进方法

Conclusion: GWM展示了3D世界模型在数据扩展方面的潜力，既能增强模仿学习的视觉表示，又能作为支持基于模型强化学习的神经模拟器

Abstract: Training robot policies within a learned world model is trending due to the
inefficiency of real-world interactions. The established image-based world
models and policies have shown prior success, but lack robust geometric
information that requires consistent spatial and physical understanding of the
three-dimensional world, even pre-trained on internet-scale video sources. To
this end, we propose a novel branch of world model named Gaussian World Model
(GWM) for robotic manipulation, which reconstructs the future state by
inferring the propagation of Gaussian primitives under the effect of robot
actions. At its core is a latent Diffusion Transformer (DiT) combined with a 3D
variational autoencoder, enabling fine-grained scene-level future state
reconstruction with Gaussian Splatting. GWM can not only enhance the visual
representation for imitation learning agent by self-supervised future
prediction training, but can serve as a neural simulator that supports
model-based reinforcement learning. Both simulated and real-world experiments
depict that GWM can precisely predict future scenes conditioned on diverse
robot actions, and can be further utilized to train policies that outperform
the state-of-the-art by impressive margins, showcasing the initial data scaling
potential of 3D world model.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 开发了一个开源ROS包，用于在Gazebo模拟器中从RGB相机生成事件流，并研究了基于事件的机器人策略在导航和操作任务中的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件相机具有微秒级延迟、高动态范围和低功耗等优势，但在主流机器人模拟器中缺乏合成事件视觉的支持，这阻碍了事件驱动方法在机器人操作和导航任务中的评估。

Method: 提出了一个用户友好的v2e ROS包，能够从RGB相机无缝生成事件流。使用基于Transformer的事件机器人策略，通过行为克隆进行训练，并在移动机器人跟随和机械臂抓取两个代表性场景中与RGB基准方法进行比较。

Result: 实验结果表明，事件引导的策略在各种操作条件下始终具有竞争优势，特别是在运动模糊、遮挡和光照变化等挑战性条件下表现更佳。

Conclusion: 事件驱动感知有潜力改善实时机器人导航和操作性能，为事件相机更广泛地集成到机器人策略学习中奠定了基础。

Abstract: Event cameras offer microsecond latency, high dynamic range, and low power
consumption, making them ideal for real-time robotic perception under
challenging conditions such as motion blur, occlusion, and illumination
changes. However, despite their advantages, synthetic event-based vision
remains largely unexplored in mainstream robotics simulators. This lack of
simulation setup hinders the evaluation of event-driven approaches for robotic
manipulation and navigation tasks. This work presents an open-source,
user-friendly v2e robotics operating system (ROS) package for Gazebo simulation
that enables seamless event stream generation from RGB camera feeds. The
package is used to investigate event-based robotic policies (ERP) for real-time
navigation and manipulation. Two representative scenarios are evaluated: (1)
object following with a mobile robot and (2) object detection and grasping with
a robotic manipulator. Transformer-based ERPs are trained by behavior cloning
and compared to RGB-based counterparts under various operating conditions.
Experimental results show that event-guided policies consistently deliver
competitive advantages. The results highlight the potential of event-driven
perception to improve real-time robotic navigation and manipulation, providing
a foundation for broader integration of event cameras into robotic policy
learning. The GitHub repo for the dataset and code:

TL;DR: MEVITA是一个开源双足机器人，使用电商平台可获得的零件制造，通过钣金焊接减少组件数量，结合强化学习实现稳健行走。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开源双足机器人大多依赖3D打印，尺寸扩展性有限且结构脆弱；金属基机器人组件繁多且难以获取。需要开发易于组装、零件易得的开源双足机器人平台。

Method: 使用钣金焊接技术将复杂几何结构集成到单一零件中，显著减少组件数量；通过仿真环境中的强化学习和Sim-to-Real迁移技术实现行走控制。

Result: 成功开发出MEVITA机器人，实现了在各种环境中的稳健行走行为，验证了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: MEVITA提供了一个可行的开源双足机器人解决方案，通过简化制造工艺和使用易得零件，使任何人都能轻松组装和开发双足机器人。

Abstract: Various bipedal robots have been developed to date, and in recent years,
there has been a growing trend toward releasing these robots as open-source
platforms. This shift is fostering an environment in which anyone can freely
develop bipedal robots and share their knowledge, rather than relying solely on
commercial products. However, most existing open-source bipedal robots are
designed to be fabricated using 3D printers, which limits their scalability in
size and often results in fragile structures. On the other hand, some
metal-based bipedal robots have been developed, but they typically involve a
large number of components, making assembly difficult, and in some cases, the
parts themselves are not readily available through e-commerce platforms. To
address these issues, we developed MEVITA, an open-source bipedal robot that
can be built entirely from components available via e-commerce. Aiming for the
minimal viable configuration for a bipedal robot, we utilized sheet metal
welding to integrate complex geometries into single parts, thereby
significantly reducing the number of components and enabling easy assembly for
anyone. Through reinforcement learning in simulation and Sim-to-Real transfer,
we demonstrated robust walking behaviors across various environments,
confirming the effectiveness of our approach. All hardware, software, and
training environments can be obtained from https://github.com/haraduka/mevita .

TL;DR: 这篇论文评估了4种现代语音识别系统在公开数据集上的表现，发现它们在实际环境中存在显著性能差异、幻觉偏向和偏见问题，这对人机交互的任务执行、用户信任和安全造成威胁。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实际环境中的语音识别系统需要处理不完美音频和多样化用户群体，在人机交互场景下这些挑战更为严峛，需要系统性评估现有ASR系统的表现。

Method: 使用8个公开数据集评估4种最先进的ASR系统，这些数据集涵盖了域特异性、口音、噪声、年龄变化、障碍性和自发性语音等六个难度维度。

Result: 分析显示了系统之间的显著性能差异、幻觉偏向和内在偏见，尽管在标准测试集上得分相似。

Conclusion: 这些限制对人机交互具有严重影响，识别错误可能干扰任务执行、损害用户信任和威胁安全，强调了在实际应用场景中进一步改进ASR系统的必要性。

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems in real-world settings need to
handle imperfect audio, often degraded by hardware limitations or environmental
noise, while accommodating diverse user groups. In human-robot interaction
(HRI), these challenges intersect to create a uniquely challenging recognition
environment. We evaluate four state-of-the-art ASR systems on eight publicly
available datasets that capture six dimensions of difficulty: domain-specific,
accented, noisy, age-variant, impaired, and spontaneous speech. Our analysis
demonstrates significant variations in performance, hallucination tendencies,
and inherent biases, despite similar scores on standard benchmarks. These
limitations have serious implications for HRI, where recognition errors can
interfere with task performance, user trust, and safety.

*Yunxiang Liu,Hongkuo Niu,Jianlin Zhu*

TL;DR: 提出了FlexiSteps Network (FSN)框架，能够根据上下文条件动态调整轨迹预测的时间步长，解决了传统固定长度预测模型的局限性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统轨迹预测模型使用固定长度的输出预测，限制了在动态现实场景中的适应性。需要一种能够根据上下文条件动态调整预测步长的框架

Method: 设计了FlexiSteps Network (FSN)框架，包含预训练的自适应预测模块(APM)来动态评估和调整输出步长，动态解码器(DD)确保即插即用，以及评分机制平衡预测步长和精度

Result: 在Argoverse和INTERACTION等基准数据集上的大量实验证明了FSN框架的有效性和灵活性

Conclusion: FSN框架通过动态调整预测步长，在保持预测精度的同时提高了轨迹预测的适应性和效率，为自动驾驶和智能决策系统提供了更实用的解决方案

Abstract: Accurate trajectory prediction is vital for autonomous driving, robotics, and
intelligent decision-making systems, yet traditional models typically rely on
fixed-length output predictions, limiting their adaptability to dynamic
real-world scenarios. In this paper, we introduce the FlexiSteps Network (FSN),
a novel framework that dynamically adjusts prediction output time steps based
on varying contextual conditions. Inspired by recent advancements addressing
observation length discrepancies and dynamic feature extraction, FSN
incorporates an pre-trained Adaptive Prediction Module (APM) to evaluate and
adjust the output steps dynamically, ensuring optimal prediction accuracy and
efficiency. To guarantee the plug-and-play of our FSN, we also design a Dynamic
Decoder(DD). Additionally, to balance the prediction time steps and prediction
accuracy, we design a scoring mechanism, which not only introduces the
Fr\'echet distance to evaluate the geometric similarity between the predicted
trajectories and the ground truth trajectories but the length of predicted
steps is also considered. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets
including Argoverse and INTERACTION demonstrate the effectiveness and
flexibility of our proposed FSN framework.

### [219] [Effect of Performance Feedback Timing on Motor Learning for a Surgical Training Task](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17830)
*Mary Kate Gale,Kailana Baker-Matsuoka,Ilana Nisky,Allison Okamura*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 实时多感官（触觉和视觉）错误反馈相比任务回放反馈或无反馈，能显著提高机器人辅助微创手术虚拟训练中的学习效果，特别是在环状物定向精度和曲线路径段的位置准确性方面表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人辅助微创手术（RMIS）已成为多种外科手术的金标准，但最佳的外科医生培训方法尚不明确。研究假设实时错误反馈比任务后反馈能更好地提高学习速度和减少错误。

Method: 42名外科新手学习虚拟环线任务（RMIS训练中的经典任务）。研究比较了三组的多感官（触觉和视觉）反馈时机：(1)实时错误反馈；(2)任务回放错误反馈；(3)无错误反馈。

Result: 实时反馈组在环状物定向精度方面表现最佳；回放反馈组在长直路径段的定向精度优于无反馈组；实时反馈组在紧曲线路径段的位置准确性优于其他组；各组在整体位置准确性方面无显著差异。

Conclusion: 实时触觉和视觉错误反馈相比回放反馈或无反馈，能改善虚拟手术任务的学习效果。实时多感官错误反馈能带来更好的训练效果，可能使外科培训生以更快速度和更高准确性发展技能。

Abstract: Objective: Robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery (RMIS) has become the
gold standard for a variety of surgical procedures, but the optimal method of
training surgeons for RMIS is unknown. We hypothesized that real-time, rather
than post-task, error feedback would better increase learning speed and reduce
errors. Methods: Forty-two surgical novices learned a virtual version of the
ring-on-wire task, a canonical task in RMIS training. We investigated the
impact of feedback timing with multi-sensory (haptic and visual) cues in three
groups: (1) real-time error feedback, (2) trial replay with error feedback, and
(3) no error feedback. Results: Participant performance was evaluated based on
the accuracy of ring position and orientation during the task. Participants who
received real-time feedback outperformed other groups in ring orientation.
Additionally, participants who received feedback in replay outperformed
participants who did not receive any error feedback on ring orientation during
long, straight path sections. There were no significant differences between
groups for ring position overall, but participants who received real-time
feedback outperformed the other groups in positional accuracy on tightly curved
path sections. Conclusion: The addition of real-time haptic and visual error
feedback improves learning outcomes in a virtual surgical task over error
feedback in replay or no error feedback at all. Significance: This work
demonstrates that multi-sensory error feedback delivered in real time leads to
better training outcomes as compared to the same feedback delivered after task
completion. This novel method of training may enable surgical trainees to
develop skills with greater speed and accuracy.

TL;DR: CubeDN是一个专为无人机3D检测设计的单阶段端到端雷达目标检测网络，通过双雷达配置和深度学习管道解决毫米波雷达在高度测量方面的限制，实现了分米级精度的无人机检测和分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着无人机的广泛使用，需要确保安全性和安全性。光学传感器在恶劣光照和环境条件下性能下降，而现有的毫米波雷达系统主要专注于2D道路用户检测，缺乏对无人机3D检测所需的高度测量能力。

Method: 提出CubeDN单阶段端到端雷达目标检测网络，采用双雷达配置来克服高度分辨率差的问题，使用新颖的深度学习管道同时实现检测、定位和分类功能。

Result: 系统能够同时检测和分类两种尺寸的无人机，在较近距离实现分米级跟踪精度，整体平均精度(AP)达到95%，平均召回率(AR)达到85%，数据处理和推理速度为10Hz。

Conclusion: CubeDN通过创新的双雷达配置和深度学习架构，成功解决了毫米波雷达在无人机3D检测中的高度测量挑战，实现了高精度、高效率的无人机检测系统，非常适合实际应用。

Abstract: As drone use has become more widespread, there is a critical need to ensure
safety and security. A key element of this is robust and accurate drone
detection and localization. While cameras and other optical sensors like LiDAR
are commonly used for object detection, their performance degrades under
adverse lighting and environmental conditions. Therefore, this has generated
interest in finding more reliable alternatives, such as millimeter-wave
(mmWave) radar. Recent research on mmWave radar object detection has
predominantly focused on 2D detection of road users. Although these systems
demonstrate excellent performance for 2D problems, they lack the sensing
capability to measure elevation, which is essential for 3D drone detection. To
address this gap, we propose CubeDN, a single-stage end-to-end radar object
detection network specifically designed for flying drones. CubeDN overcomes
challenges such as poor elevation resolution by utilizing a dual radar
configuration and a novel deep learning pipeline. It simultaneously detects,
localizes, and classifies drones of two sizes, achieving decimeter-level
tracking accuracy at closer ranges with overall $95\%$ average precision (AP)
and $85\%$ average recall (AR). Furthermore, CubeDN completes data processing
and inference at 10Hz, making it highly suitable for practical applications.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文提出任务/指令依赖的affordance概念，构建了包含1.5万个物体-指令-可操作性三元组的数据集，并开发了基于大语言模型的"搜索验证"推理流程来预测指令导向的可操作性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统affordance研究忽略了任务/指令依赖性，即同一物体在不同指令下会产生不同的可操作区域和方向，这限制了智能机器人在物体操作中的实用性。

Method: 构建了包含1.5万个egocentric视角的三元组数据集；提出"search against verifiers"流程，让大语言模型逐步预测affordance并在迭代过程中自我验证，模拟推理过程。

Result: 实验表明该方法不仅解锁了新的指令导向affordance预测能力，而且在广泛范围内取得了优异性能。

Conclusion: 任务/指令依赖的affordance概念对于智能机器人操作至关重要，提出的数据集和方法为指令导向的可操作性预测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Affordance is crucial for intelligent robots in the context of object
manipulation. In this paper, we argue that affordance should be
task-/instruction-dependent, which is overlooked by many previous works. That
is, different instructions can lead to different manipulation regions and
directions even for the same object. According to this observation, we present
a new dataset comprising fifteen thousand object-instruction-affordance
triplets. All scenes in the dataset are from an egocentric viewpoint, designed
to approximate the perspective of a human-like robot. Furthermore, we
investigate how to enable large multimodal models (LMMs) to serve as affordance
predictors by implementing a ``search against verifiers'' pipeline. An LMM is
asked to progressively predict affordances, with the output at each step being
verified by itself during the iterative process, imitating a reasoning process.
Experiments show that our method not only unlocks new instruction-oriented
affordance prediction capabilities, but also achieves outstanding performance
broadly.

Abstract: This paper introduces a holistic perception system for internal and external
monitoring of autonomous vehicles, with the aim of demonstrating a novel
AI-leveraged self-adaptive framework of advanced vehicle technologies and
solutions that optimize perception and experience on-board. Internal monitoring
system relies on a multi-camera setup designed for predicting and identifying
driver and occupant behavior through facial recognition, exploiting in addition
a large language model as virtual assistant. Moreover, the in-cabin monitoring
system includes AI-empowered smart sensors that measure air-quality and perform
thermal comfort analysis for efficient on and off-boarding. On the other hand,
external monitoring system perceives the surrounding environment of vehicle,
through a LiDAR-based cost-efficient semantic segmentation approach, that
performs highly accurate and efficient super-resolution on low-quality raw 3D
point clouds. The holistic perception framework is developed in the context of
EU's Horizon Europe programm AutoTRUST, and has been integrated and deployed on
a real electric vehicle provided by ALKE. Experimental validation and
evaluation at the integration site of Joint Research Centre at Ispra, Italy,
highlights increased performance and efficiency of the modular blocks of the
proposed perception architecture.

Conclusion: 深度学习感知与基于规则的自适应决策相结合，能够显著提升汽车安全关键系统的性能。

Abstract: Ensuring safety in autonomous driving requires a seamless integration of
perception and decision making under uncertain conditions. Although computer
vision (CV) models such as YOLO achieve high accuracy in detecting traffic
signs and obstacles, their performance degrades in drift scenarios caused by
weather variations or unseen objects. This work presents a simulated autonomous
driving system that combines a context aware CV model with adaptive control
using the ADORE framework. The CARLA simulator was integrated with ADORE via
the ROS bridge, allowing real-time communication between perception, decision,
and control modules. A simulated test case was designed in both clear and drift
weather conditions to demonstrate the robust detection performance of the
perception model while ADORE successfully adapted vehicle behavior to speed
limits and obstacles with low response latency. The findings highlight the
potential of coupling deep learning-based perception with rule-based adaptive
decision making to improve automotive safety critical system.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种在完全无视觉输入情况下，仅依靠触觉反馈来搜索和抓取物体的机器人方法，使用覆盖敏感皮肤的完整机械臂表面进行接触感知。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器人物体定位和抓取主要依赖视觉传感器，触觉反馈通常只是辅助。本研究探索在完全无视觉输入的情况下，仅依靠触觉反馈来搜索和抓取物体的极端情况。

Method: 将搜索分为两个阶段：(1) 使用完整机器人表面进行粗略工作空间探索；(2) 使用配备力/力矩传感器的末端执行器进行精确定位。整个机械臂表面覆盖敏感皮肤来感知接触。

Result: 在仿真和真实机器人上系统评估，成功率为85.7%。使用全身接触的方法比仅使用末端执行器触觉反馈的基线方法快6倍。还展示了在桌面上定位和抓取多个物体的能力。

Conclusion: 该方法不限于特定设置，可部署在任何具有全身表面接触感知能力的平台上，在视觉感知具有挑战性的领域（如农业中在树叶中定位和采摘水果蔬菜）具有广泛应用前景。

Abstract: Locating and grasping of objects by robots is typically performed using
visual sensors. Haptic feedback from contacts with the environment is only
secondary if present at all. In this work, we explored an extreme case of
searching for and grasping objects in complete absence of visual input, relying
on haptic feedback only. The main novelty lies in the use of contacts over the
complete surface of a robot manipulator covered with sensitive skin. The search
is divided into two phases: (1) coarse workspace exploration with the complete
robot surface, followed by (2) precise localization using the end-effector
equipped with a force/torque sensor. We systematically evaluated this method in
simulation and on the real robot, demonstrating that diverse objects can be
located, grasped, and put in a basket. The overall success rate on the real
robot for one object was 85.7\% with failures mainly while grasping specific
objects. The method using whole-body contacts is six times faster compared to a
baseline that uses haptic feedback only on the end-effector. We also show
locating and grasping multiple objects on the table. This method is not
restricted to our specific setup and can be deployed on any platform with the
ability of sensing contacts over the entire body surface. This work holds
promise for diverse applications in areas with challenging visual perception
(due to lighting, dust, smoke, occlusion) such as in agriculture when fruits or
vegetables need to be located inside foliage and picked.

Abstract: Controlling high-dimensional and nonlinear musculoskeletal models of the
human body is a foundational scientific challenge. Recent machine learning
breakthroughs have heralded policies that master individual skills like
reaching, object manipulation and locomotion in musculoskeletal systems with
many degrees of freedom. However, these agents are merely "specialists",
achieving high performance for a single skill. In this work, we develop Arnold,
a generalist policy that masters multiple tasks and embodiments. Arnold
combines behavior cloning and fine-tuning with PPO to achieve expert or
super-expert performance in 14 challenging control tasks from dexterous object
manipulation to locomotion. A key innovation is Arnold's sensorimotor
vocabulary, a compositional representation of the semantics of heterogeneous
sensory modalities, objectives, and actuators. Arnold leverages this vocabulary
via a transformer architecture to deal with the variable observation and action
spaces of each task. This framework supports efficient multi-task,
multi-embodiment learning and facilitates rapid adaptation to novel tasks.
Finally, we analyze Arnold to provide insights into biological motor control,
corroborating recent findings on the limited transferability of muscle
synergies across tasks.

Motivation: 通信延迟对移动机器人遥操作中的人机协作产生负面影响，但之前没有研究探索延迟对人类操作表现和神经认知的具体影响，需要填补这一研究空白。

Method: 采用人在环实验，招募10名参与者，在0-500ms延迟范围内以100ms为增量进行测试，同时采集脑电图(EEG)数据和机器人行为数据。

Conclusion: 这些发现首次提供了人类在遥操作任务中的感知和认知延迟阈值的证据，为延迟补偿策略的设计提供了关键的神经认知见解。

Abstract: Communication delays in mobile robot teleoperation adversely affect
human-machine collaboration. Understanding delay effects on human operational
performance and neurocognition is essential for resolving this issue. However,
no previous research has explored this. To fill this gap, we conduct a
human-in-the-loop experiment involving 10 participants, integrating
electroencephalography (EEG) and robot behavior data under varying delays
(0-500 ms in 100 ms increments) to systematically investigate these effects.
Behavior analysis reveals significant performance degradation at 200-300 ms
delays, affecting both task efficiency and accuracy. EEG analysis discovers
features with significant delay dependence: frontal $\theta/\beta$-band and
parietal $\alpha$-band power. We also identify a threshold window (100-200 ms)
for early perception of delay in humans, during which these EEG features first
exhibit significant differences. When delay exceeds 400 ms, all features
plateau, indicating saturation of cognitive resource allocation at

Motivation: 研究推力辅助双足机器人的混合腿-推力器运动基本原理，理解不同运动模式下稳定运动的机制

Method: 分析Harpy机器人在小跑和跳跃实验中的实验数据，研究多种运动模式下的数据，包括关节行为、足部放置、能量水平和相位转换

Result: 实现了有界轨迹的稳定运动，关节扭矩低且对称跟踪准确，足部放置精确符合运动学约束，欠驱动自由度稳定无发散，腿部提供主要推进力，推力器实现空中控制

Conclusion: 混合驱动方法具有鲁棒性，腿部和推力器的战略协同是实现稳定运动的关键，空中相位需要特定的控制策略

Abstract: This study presents an analysis of experimental data from Harpy, a
thruster-assisted bipedal robot developed at Northeastern University. The study
examines data sets from trotting and jumping experiments to understand the
fundamental principles governing hybrid leg-thruster locomotion. Through data
analysis across multiple locomotion modes, this research reveals that Harpy
achieves stable locomotion with bounded trajectories and consistent foot
placement through strategic leg-thruster synergy. The results demonstrate
controlled joint behavior with low torques and symmetric tracking, accurate
foot placement within kinematic constraints despite phase-transition
perturbations, and underactuated degree-of-freedom stability without
divergence. Energy level analysis reveals that legs provide primary propulsion,
while the thrusters enable additional aerial phase control. The analysis
identifies critical body-leg coupling dynamics during aerial phases that
require phase-specific control strategies. Consistent repeatability and
symmetry across experiments validate the robustness of the hybrid actuation
approach.

Motivation: 现有方法通常将离散和连续决策空间的共识视为不同问题，需要一种统一的分布式算法来处理群体机器人系统中的共识问题。

Method: 使用高斯置信传播(GBP)算法，将群体表示为因子图，通过纯对等消息传递实现分布式共识，支持形状形成和离散决策两种应用场景。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法在可扩展性和效率方面优于现有方法，能够有效处理路径规划、碰撞避免和离散决策共识问题。

Conclusion: DANCeRS为多机器人系统提供了一种有前景的分布式共识解决方案，统一处理离散和连续决策问题，具有良好的实际应用价值。

Abstract: Robot swarms require cohesive collective behaviour to address diverse
challenges, including shape formation and decision-making. Existing approaches
often treat consensus in discrete and continuous decision spaces as distinct
problems. We present DANCeRS, a unified, distributed algorithm leveraging
Gaussian Belief Propagation (GBP) to achieve consensus in both domains. By
representing a swarm as a factor graph our method ensures scalability and
robustness in dynamic environments, relying on purely peer-to-peer message
passing. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our general framework through two
applications where agents in a swarm must achieve consensus on global behaviour
whilst relying on local communication. In the first, robots must perform path
planning and collision avoidance to create shape formations. In the second, we
show how the same framework can be used by a group of robots to form a
consensus over a set of discrete decisions. Experimental results highlight our
method's scalability and efficiency compared to recent approaches to these
problems making it a promising solution for multi-robot systems requiring
distributed consensus. We encourage the reader to see the supplementary video
demo.

Method: 1) 整合足印、LiDAR和相机数据作为视觉基础模型的提示，生成考虑语义和几何线索的可通行性标签；2) 训练解耦式双流网络进行多模态联合学习；3) 引入稀疏LiDAR监督减轻伪标签噪声

Conclusion: 提出的多模态自监督框架有效解决了可通行性估计中的模态单一和不可通行区域识别困难问题，通过多模态融合和噪声抑制实现了更鲁棒的性能

Abstract: Traversability estimation is critical for enabling robots to navigate across
diverse terrains and environments. While recent self-supervised learning
methods achieve promising results, they often fail to capture the
characteristics of non-traversable regions. Moreover, most prior works
concentrate on a single modality, overlooking the complementary strengths
offered by integrating heterogeneous sensory modalities for more robust
traversability estimation. To address these limitations, we propose a
multimodal self-supervised framework for traversability labeling and
estimation. First, our annotation pipeline integrates footprint, LiDAR, and
camera data as prompts for a vision foundation model, generating traversability
labels that account for both semantic and geometric cues. Then, leveraging
these labels, we train a dual-stream network that jointly learns from different
modalities in a decoupled manner, enhancing its capacity to recognize diverse
traversability patterns. In addition, we incorporate sparse LiDAR-based
supervision to mitigate the noise introduced by pseudo labels. Finally,
extensive experiments conducted across urban, off-road, and campus environments
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. The proposed automatic labeling
method consistently achieves around 88% IoU across diverse datasets. Compared
to existing self-supervised state-of-the-art methods, our multimodal
traversability estimation network yields consistently higher IoU, improving by
1.6-3.5% on all evaluated datasets.

Motivation: 现有的基于扩散策略的双手机器人操作方法忽略了物理安全约束，可能导致危险行为损坏机器人和物体

Method: 设计不同双臂协作模式的安全约束成本函数，通过扩散去噪过程的引导采样优化轨迹，使用视觉语言模型动态调度成本函数

Result: 在8个模拟任务中成功率提升13.7%，不安全交互减少18.8%；在4个真实任务中成功率提升32.5%

Conclusion: SafeBimanual框架有效提升了双手机器人操作的安全性和性能，具有实际应用价值

Abstract: Bimanual manipulation has been widely applied in household services and
manufacturing, which enables the complex task completion with coordination
requirements. Recent diffusion-based policy learning approaches have achieved
promising performance in modeling action distributions for bimanual
manipulation. However, they ignored the physical safety constraints of bimanual
manipulation, which leads to the dangerous behaviors with damage to robots and
objects. To this end, we propose a test-time trajectory optimization framework
named SafeBimanual for any pre-trained diffusion-based bimanual manipulation
policies, which imposes the safety constraints on bimanual actions to avoid
dangerous robot behaviors with improved success rate. Specifically, we design
diverse cost functions for safety constraints in different dual-arm cooperation
patterns including avoidance of tearing objects and collision between arms and
objects, which optimizes the manipulator trajectories with guided sampling of
diffusion denoising process. Moreover, we employ a vision-language model (VLM)
to schedule the cost functions by specifying keypoints and corresponding
pairwise relationship, so that the optimal safety constraint is dynamically
generated in the entire bimanual manipulation process. SafeBimanual
demonstrates superiority on 8 simulated tasks in RoboTwin with a 13.7% increase
in success rate and a 18.8% reduction in unsafe interactions over
state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods. Extensive experiments on 4 real-world
tasks further verify its practical value by improving the success rate by
32.5%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的VLA模型通过下一帧预测训练内部世界模型，但这种方法将静态外观与动态运动纠缠在一起，导致不合理的视觉预测和低效的策略学习。

Method: 提出Visual CoT框架，在单个自回归Transformer中实现"当前帧→光流→下一帧"的推理过程，通过中间光流表示编码运动动力学。

Result: 在机器人操作基准测试中实现了最先进的性能，显著提高了样本效率，产生了更连贯的视觉预测。

Conclusion: FlowVLA为世界建模提供了更原则性的基础，通过解耦动力学学习实现了更好的视觉预测和策略学习效果。

Abstract: Many Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models rely on an internal world model
trained via next-frame prediction. This approach, however, struggles with
physical reasoning as it entangles static appearance with dynamic motion, often
resulting in implausible visual forecasts and inefficient policy learning. To
address these limitations, we introduce the Visual Chain of Thought (Visual
CoT): a pre-training framework that encourages a model to reason about how a
scene evolves before predicting what it will look like. We instantiate this
principle in FlowVLA, which predicts a future frame ($v_{t+1}$) only after
generating an intermediate optical flow representation ($f_t$) that encodes
motion dynamics. This ``$v_t \rightarrow f_t \rightarrow v_{t+1}$'' reasoning
process is implemented within a single autoregressive Transformer, guiding the
model to learn disentangled dynamics. As a result, FlowVLA produces coherent
visual predictions and facilitates more efficient policy learning. Experiments
on challenging robotics manipulation benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art
performance with substantially improved sample efficiency, pointing toward a
more principled foundation for world modeling. Project page:

Abstract: Accurate 3D geometry acquisition is essential for a wide range of
applications, such as computer graphics, autonomous driving, robotics, and
augmented reality. However, raw point clouds acquired in real-world
environments are often corrupted with noise due to various factors such as
sensor, lighting, material, environment etc, which reduces geometric fidelity
and degrades downstream performance. Point cloud denoising is a fundamental
problem, aiming to recover clean point sets while preserving underlying
structures. Classical optimization-based methods, guided by hand-crafted
filters or geometric priors, have been extensively studied but struggle to
handle diverse and complex noise patterns. Recent deep learning approaches
leverage neural network architectures to learn distinctive representations and
demonstrate strong outcomes, particularly on complex and large-scale point
clouds. Provided these significant advances, this survey provides a
comprehensive and up-to-date review of deep learning-based point cloud
denoising methods up to August 2025. We organize the literature from two
perspectives: (1) supervision level (supervised vs. unsupervised), and (2)
modeling perspective, proposing a functional taxonomy that unifies diverse
approaches by their denoising principles. We further analyze architectural
trends both structurally and chronologically, establish a unified benchmark
with consistent training settings, and evaluate methods in terms of denoising
quality, surface fidelity, point distribution, and computational efficiency.
Finally, we discuss open challenges and outline directions for future research
in this rapidly evolving field.

Abstract: Generating coherent and diverse human dances from music signals has gained
tremendous progress in animating virtual avatars. While existing methods
support direct dance synthesis, they fail to recognize that enabling users to
edit dance movements is far more practical in real-world choreography
scenarios. Moreover, the lack of high-quality dance datasets incorporating
iterative editing also limits addressing this challenge. To achieve this goal,
we first construct DanceRemix, a large-scale multi-turn editable dance dataset
comprising the prompt featuring over 25.3M dance frames and 84.5K pairs. In
addition, we propose a novel framework for iterative and editable dance
generation coherently aligned with given music signals, namely DanceEditor.
Considering the dance motion should be both musical rhythmic and enable
iterative editing by user descriptions, our framework is built upon a
prediction-then-editing paradigm unifying multi-modal conditions. At the
initial prediction stage, our framework improves the authority of generated
results by directly modeling dance movements from tailored, aligned music.
Moreover, at the subsequent iterative editing stages, we incorporate text
descriptions as conditioning information to draw the editable results through a
specifically designed Cross-modality Editing Module (CEM). Specifically, CEM
adaptively integrates the initial prediction with music and text prompts as
temporal motion cues to guide the synthesized sequences. Thereby, the results
display music harmonics while preserving fine-grained semantic alignment with
text descriptions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
outperforms the state-of-the-art models on our newly collected DanceRemix
dataset. Code is available at https://lzvsdy.github.io/DanceEditor/.

Abstract: Holographic near-eye displays offer ultra-compact form factors for virtual
and augmented reality systems, but rely on advanced computer-generated
holography (CGH) algorithms to convert 3D scenes into interference patterns
that can be displayed on spatial light modulators (SLMs). Gaussian Wave
Splatting (GWS) has recently emerged as a powerful CGH paradigm that allows for
the conversion of Gaussians, a state-of-the-art neural 3D representation, into
holograms. However, GWS assumes smooth-phase distributions over the Gaussian
primitives, limiting their ability to model view-dependent effects and
reconstruct accurate defocus blur, and severely under-utilizing the
space-bandwidth product of the SLM. In this work, we propose random-phase GWS
(GWS-RP) to improve bandwidth utilization, which has the effect of increasing
eyebox size, reconstructing accurate defocus blur and parallax, and supporting
time-multiplexed rendering to suppress speckle artifacts.
  At the core of GWS-RP are (1) a fundamentally new wavefront compositing
procedure and (2) an alpha-blending scheme specifically designed for
random-phase Gaussian primitives, ensuring physically correct color
reconstruction and robust occlusion handling. Additionally, we present the
first formally derived algorithm for applying random phase to Gaussian
primitives, grounded in rigorous statistical optics analysis and validated
through practical near-eye display applications. Through extensive simulations
and experimental validations, we demonstrate that these advancements,
collectively with time-multiplexing, uniquely enables full-bandwith light field
CGH that supports accurate accurate parallax and defocus, yielding
state-of-the-art image quality and perceptually faithful 3D holograms for
next-generation near-eye displays.

Abstract: Reference-based sketch colorization methods have garnered significant
attention for the potential application in animation and digital illustration
production. However, most existing methods are trained with image triplets of
sketch, reference, and ground truth that are semantically and spatially
similar, while real-world references and sketches often exhibit substantial
misalignment. This mismatch in data distribution between training and inference
leads to overfitting, consequently resulting in artifacts and signif- icant
quality degradation in colorization results. To address this issue, we conduct
an in-depth analysis of the reference representations, defined as the
intermedium to transfer information from reference to sketch. Building on this
analysis, we introduce a novel framework that leverages distinct reference
representations to optimize different aspects of the colorization process. Our
approach decomposes colorization into modular stages, al- lowing
region-specific reference injection to enhance visual quality and reference
similarity while mitigating spatial artifacts. Specifically, we first train a
backbone network guided by high-level semantic embeddings. We then introduce a
background encoder and a style encoder, trained in separate stages, to enhance
low-level feature transfer and improve reference similar- ity. This design also
enables flexible inference modes suited for a variety of use cases. Extensive
qualitative and quantitative evaluations, together with a user study,
demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed method compared to
existing approaches. Code and pre-trained weight will be made publicly
available upon paper acceptance.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The emergence of 3D artificial intelligence-generated content (3D-AIGC) has
enabled rapid synthesis of intricate geometries. However, a fundamental
disconnect persists between AI-generated content and human-centric design
paradigms, rooted in representational incompatibilities: conventional AI
frameworks predominantly manipulate meshes or neural representations
(\emph{e.g.}, NeRF, Gaussian Splatting), while designers operate within
parametric modeling tools. This disconnection diminishes the practical value of
AI for 3D industry, undermining the efficiency of human-AI collaboration. To
resolve this disparity, we focus on generating design operation sequences,
which are structured modeling histories that comprehensively capture the
step-by-step construction process of 3D assets and align with designers'
typical workflows in modern 3D software. We first reformulate fundamental
modeling operations (\emph{e.g.}, \emph{Extrude}, \emph{Boolean}) into
differentiable units, enabling joint optimization of continuous (\emph{e.g.},
\emph{Extrude} height) and discrete (\emph{e.g.}, \emph{Boolean} type)
parameters via gradient-based learning. Based on these differentiable
operations, a hierarchical graph with gating mechanism is constructed and
optimized end-to-end by minimizing Chamfer Distance to target geometries.
Multi-stage sequence length constraint and domain rule penalties enable
unsupervised learning of compact design sequences without ground-truth sequence
supervision. Extensive validation demonstrates that the generated operation
sequences achieve high geometric fidelity, smooth mesh wiring, rational step
composition and flexible editing capacity, with full compatibility within
design industry.

Conclusion: MeshSplat通过创新的2D高斯溅射桥接方法，成功解决了稀疏视图下的表面重建挑战，为计算机视觉和图形学领域的几何重建提供了新思路。

Abstract: Surface reconstruction has been widely studied in computer vision and
graphics. However, existing surface reconstruction works struggle to recover
accurate scene geometry when the input views are extremely sparse. To address
this issue, we propose MeshSplat, a generalizable sparse-view surface
reconstruction framework via Gaussian Splatting. Our key idea is to leverage
2DGS as a bridge, which connects novel view synthesis to learned geometric
priors and then transfers these priors to achieve surface reconstruction.
Specifically, we incorporate a feed-forward network to predict per-view
pixel-aligned 2DGS, which enables the network to synthesize novel view images
and thus eliminates the need for direct 3D ground-truth supervision. To improve
the accuracy of 2DGS position and orientation prediction, we propose a Weighted
Chamfer Distance Loss to regularize the depth maps, especially in overlapping
areas of input views, and also a normal prediction network to align the
orientation of 2DGS with normal vectors predicted by a monocular normal
estimator. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed
improvement, demonstrating that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance in generalizable sparse-view mesh reconstruction tasks. Project

Motivation: 研究度量空间中树覆盖问题，探索在欧几里得空间中使用最少树的数量来构建具有常数拉伸度的树覆盖，这对于网络设计、路由算法等领域有重要应用价值。

Method: 通过数学证明和构造性方法，为二维欧几里得平面构造了一个具体的两棵树覆盖方案，并针对高维情况给出了下界证明。

Result: 在二维平面上成功构造了由两棵树组成的常数拉伸度树覆盖；在高维空间中证明了任何常数拉伸度的强化树覆盖变体至少需要(d+1)/2棵树。

Abstract: For a given metric space $(P,\phi)$, a tree cover of stretch $t$ is a
collection of trees on $P$ such that edges $(x,y)$ of trees receive length
$\phi(x,y)$, and such that for any pair of points $u,v\in P$ there is a tree
$T$ in the collection such that the induced graph distance in $T$ between $u$
and $v$ is at most $t\phi(u,v).$ In this paper, we show that, for any set of
points $P$ on the Euclidean plane, there is a tree cover consisting of two
trees and with stretch $O(1).$ Although the problem in higher dimensions
remains elusive, we manage to prove that for a slightly stronger variant of a
tree cover problem we must have at least $(d+1)/2$ trees in any constant
stretch tree cover in $\mathbb R^d$.

TL;DR: 本文研究插入式凸包数据结构，发现基于Graham扫描的朴素O(h)算法在实际应用中优于理论最优方法，并提出了一种基于向量的对数方法，虽然理论复杂度较差但缓存性能优异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究插入式凸包数据结构，解决指针树结构因内存局部性差导致的实践性能问题，探索在鲁棒性、内存访问模式和空间使用之间的权衡

Method: 开发了基于向量的对数方法（受Overmars对数方法启发），使用O(log n)个连续向量存储数据，支持O(log² n)时间查询；同时比较了基于Graham扫描的朴素O(h)算法和树状结构方法

Result: 实证评估显示：朴素O(h)算法在实际工作负载下始终优于理论和实践中最先进的方法；向量对数方法虽然理论界限较差，但在所有测试场景中都具有高度竞争力，当凸包变大时达到最优

Conclusion: 理论最优的树状方法在实践中从未达到最优，而缓存友好的向量方法和简单的朴素算法在实际应用中表现更佳，挑战了传统计算几何中对渐进复杂度的过度重视

Abstract: Convex hull data structures are fundamental in computational geometry. We
study insertion-only data structures, supporting various containment and
intersection queries. When $P$ is sorted by $x$- or $y$-coordinate, convex
hulls can be constructed in linear time using classical algorithms such as
Graham scan. We investigate a variety of methods tailored to the insertion-only
setting. We explore a broad selection of trade-offs involving robustness,
memory access patterns, and space usage, providing an extensive evaluation of
both existing and novel techniques. Logarithmic-time methods rely on
pointer-based tree structures, which suffer in practice due to poor memory
locality. Motivated by this, we develop a vector-based solution inspired by
Overmars' logarithmic method. Our structure has worse asymptotic bounds,
supporting queries in $O(\log^2 n)$ time, but stores data in $O(\log n)$
contiguous vectors, greatly improving cache performance.
  Through empirical evaluation on real-world and synthetic data sets, we
uncover surprising trends. Let $h$ denote the size of the convex hull. We show
that a na\"ive $O(h)$ insertion-only algorithm based on Graham scan
consistently outperforms both theoretical and practical state-of-the-art
methods under realistic workloads, even on data sets with rather large convex
hulls. While tree-based methods with $O(\log h)$ update times offer solid
theoretical guarantees, they are never optimal in practice. In contrast, our
vector-based logarithmic method, despite its theoretically inferior bounds, is
highly competitive across all tested scenarios. It is optimal whenever the
convex hull becomes large.

TL;DR: 提出了一种计算几何图动态可视化的方法，通过序列帧显示图的子集，保持顶点位置不变并避免边交叉，目标是最大化最小帧大小的平面故事。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决几何图动态可视化问题，需要在保持用户心智地图（绘制稳定性）的同时控制每帧的视觉复杂度（避免边交叉）。

Method: 使用平面故事序列：首帧显示非交叉边子集，后续每帧添加一条新边并删除与其交叉的所有边。研究理论模型并设计精确算法和启发式算法。

Result: 开发了多种算法，在效率和效果之间提供不同的权衡，具体取决于输入图的结构。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效平衡动态可视化的稳定性和视觉复杂度，为几何图的可视化提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: We address the problem of computing a dynamic visualization of a geometric
graph $G$ as a sequence of frames. Each frame shows only a portion of the graph
but their union covers $G$ entirely. The two main requirements of our dynamic
visualization are: $(i)$ guaranteeing drawing stability, so to preserve the
user's mental map; $(ii)$ keeping the visual complexity of each frame low. To
satisfy the first requirement, we never change the position of the vertices.
Regarding the second requirement, we avoid edge crossings in each frame. More
precisely, in the first frame we visualize a suitable subset of non-crossing
edges; in each subsequent frame, exactly one new edge enters the visualization
and all the edges that cross with it are deleted. We call such a sequence of
frames a planar story of $G$. Our goal is to find a planar story whose minimum
number of edges contemporarily displayed is maximized (i.e., a planar story
that maximizes the minimum frame size). Besides studying our model from a
theoretical point of view, we also design and experimentally compare different
algorithms, both exact techniques and heuristics. These algorithms provide an
array of alternative trade-offs between efficiency and effectiveness, also
depending on the structure of the input graph.

Conclusion: 该符号框架能够有效减少计算机几何、图形学和自动建模中的高成本几何验证需求，通过结构性预检查提高效率。

Abstract: I present a coordinate-free, symbolic framework for deciding whether a given
set of polygonal faces can form a closed, genus-zero polyhedral surface and for
predicting how such a surface could be decomposed into internal tetrahedra. The
method uses only discrete incidence variables, such as the number of internal
tetrahedra $T$, internal gluing triangles $N_i$, and internal triangulation
segments $S_i$, and applies combinatorial feasibility checks before any
geometric embedding is attempted. For polyhedra in \emph{normal form}, I record
exact incidence identities linking $V,E,F$ to a flatness parameter
$S:=\sum_f(\deg f-3)$, and I identify parity-sensitive effects in $E$, $F$, and
$S$. The external identities and parity-sensitive bounds hold universally for
genus-0 polyhedral graphs. For internal quantities, I prove exact relations
$N_i=2T-V+2$ and $T-N_i+S_i=1$ (with $S_i$ taken to be the number of interior
edges) and obtain restricted linear ranges within a \emph{shell--aligned
ladder} subclass (SALT), where at most one interior edge is introduced per
layer. Consequently, I propose a symbolic workflow that yields rapid pre-checks
for structural impossibility, reducing the need for costly geometric validation
in computational geometry, graphics, and automated modeling.
