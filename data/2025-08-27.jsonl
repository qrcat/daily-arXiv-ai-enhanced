However, the extreme data imbalance in these logs, where mundane\nscenarios vastly outnumber rare \"long-tail\" events, leads to brittle and unsafe\npolicies when using standard uniform data sampling. In this work, we address\nthis challenge through a systematic, large-scale comparative study of data\ncuration strategies designed to focus the learning process on information-rich\nsamples. We investigate six distinct criticality weighting schemes which are\ncategorized into three families: heuristic-based, uncertainty-based, and\nbehavior-based. These are evaluated at two temporal scales, the individual\ntimestep and the complete scenario. We train seven goal-conditioned\nConservative Q-Learning (CQL) agents with a state-of-the-art, attention-based\narchitecture and evaluate them in the high-fidelity Waymax simulator. Our\nresults demonstrate that all data curation methods significantly outperform the\nbaseline. Notably, data-driven curation using model uncertainty as a signal\nachieves the most significant safety improvements, reducing the collision rate\nby nearly three-fold (from 16.0% to 5.5%). Furthermore, we identify a clear\ntrade-off where timestep-level weighting excels at reactive safety while\nscenario-level weighting improves long-horizon planning. Our work provides a\ncomprehensive framework for data curation in Offline RL and underscores that\nintelligent, non-uniform sampling is a critical component for building safe and\nreliable autonomous agents."}

While deep learning has\nrevolutionized terrestrial 3D detection, its application underwater faces a\ncritical bottleneck: obtaining sufficient annotated sonar data is prohibitively\nexpensive and logistically complex, often requiring specialized vessels, expert\nsurveyors, and favorable weather conditions. This work addresses a fundamental\nquestion: Can we achieve reliable underwater 3D object detection without\nreal-world training data? We tackle this challenge by developing and comparing\ntwo paradigms for training-free detection of artificial structures in multibeam\necho-sounder point clouds. Our dual approach combines a physics-based sonar\nsimulation pipeline that generates synthetic training data for state-of-the-art\nneural networks, with a robust model-based template matching system that\nleverages geometric priors of target objects. Evaluation on real bathymetry\nsurveys from the Baltic Sea reveals surprising insights: while neural networks\ntrained on synthetic data achieve 98% mean Average Precision (mAP) on simulated\nscenes, they drop to 40% mAP on real sonar data due to domain shift.\nConversely, our template matching approach maintains 83% mAP on real data\nwithout requiring any training, demonstrating remarkable robustness to acoustic\nnoise and environmental variations. Our findings challenge conventional wisdom\nabout data-hungry deep learning in underwater domains and establish the first\nlarge-scale benchmark for training-free underwater 3D detection.

We consider two distinct\nsettings: the geometric setting, in which the vertices are points embedded in\nthe plane and all occurring odd matchings are crossing-free, and a\ncombinatorial setting, in which we consider odd matchings in general graphs.\n  For the latter setting, we provide a complete polynomial time checkable\ncharacterization of graphs in which any two odd matchings can be reconfigured\ninto each another. This complements the previously known result that the flip\ngraph is always connected in the geometric setting [Aichholzer, Br\\\"otzner,\nPerz, and Schnider. Flips in odd matchings]. In the combinatorial setting, we\nprove that the diameter of the flip graph, if connected, is linear in the\nnumber of vertices.

This naturally raises an important question: can\ngeneral-purpose standalone VLMs effectively solve HOI detection, and how do\nthey compare with specialized HOI methods? Answering this requires a benchmark\nthat can accommodate both paradigms. However, existing HOI benchmarks such as\nHICO-DET were developed before the emergence of modern VLMs, and their\nevaluation protocols require exact matches to annotated HOI classes. This is\npoorly aligned with the generative nature of VLMs, which often yield multiple\nvalid interpretations in ambiguous cases. For example, a static image may\ncapture a person mid-motion with a frisbee, which can plausibly be interpreted\nas either \"throwing\" or \"catching\". When only \"catching\" is annotated, the\nother, though equally plausible for the image, is marked incorrect when exact\nmatching is used. As a result, correct predictions might be penalized,\naffecting both VLMs and HOI-specific methods. To avoid penalizing valid\npredictions, we introduce a new benchmark that reformulates HOI detection as a\nmultiple-answer multiple-choice task, where each question includes only\nground-truth positive options and a curated set of negatives that are\nconstructed to reduce ambiguity (e.g., when \"catching\" is annotated, \"throwing\"\nis not selected as a negative to avoid penalizing valid predictions).

The majority of\ncurrent approaches for roof plane segmentation rely on the manually designed or\nlearned features followed by some specifically designed geometric clustering\nstrategies. Because the learned features are more powerful than the manually\ndesigned features, the deep learning-based approaches usually perform better\nthan the traditional approaches. However, the current deep learning-based\napproaches have three unsolved problems. The first is that most of them are not\ntruly end-to-end, the plane segmentation results may be not optimal. The second\nis that the point feature discriminability near the edges is relatively low,\nleading to inaccurate planar edges. The third is that the planar geometric\ncharacteristics are not sufficiently considered to constrain the network\ntraining. To solve these issues, a novel edge-aware transformer-based network,\nnamed RoofSeg, is developed for segmenting roof planes from LiDAR point clouds\nin a truly end-to-end manner. In the RoofSeg, we leverage a transformer\nencoder-decoder-based framework to hierarchically predict the plane instance\nmasks with the use of a set of learnable plane queries.

It generates two sub-paths for each threat,\nselects the optimal route based on a heuristic rule, and iteratively refines\nthe path until the target is reached. Considering the UAV kinematic and dynamic\nconstraints, a modified smoothing technique based on quadratic B\\'ezier curves\nis adopted to generate a smooth and efficient route. Experimental results show\nthat the TIG algorithm can generate the shortest path in less time, starting\nfrom 0.01 seconds, with fewer turning angles compared to A*, PRM, RRT*, Tangent\nGraph, and Static APPATT algorithms in static environments. Furthermore, in\ncompletely unknown and partially known environments, TIG demonstrates efficient\nreal-time path planning capabilities for collision avoidance, outperforming APF\nand Dynamic APPATT algorithms."}

Traditional methods for\ngenerating datasets to train these prediction models often involve putting\nrobots into potentially hazardous environments, posing risks to equipment and\nsafety. To solve this problem, we present ZeST, a novel approach leveraging\nvisual reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to create a\ntraversability map in real-time without exposing robots to danger. Our approach\nnot only performs zero-shot traversability and mitigates the risks associated\nwith real-world data collection but also accelerates the development of\nadvanced navigation systems, offering a cost-effective and scalable solution.\nTo support our findings, we present navigation results, in both controlled\nindoor and unstructured outdoor environments. As shown in the experiments, our\nmethod provides safer navigation when compared to other state-of-the-art\nmethods, constantly reaching the final goal."}

In this work, we present a collection of optimizations that\nsignificantly improve both the training and inference performance of INPC\nwithout sacrificing visual fidelity. The most significant modifications are an\nimproved rasterizer implementation, more effective sampling techniques, and the\nincorporation of pre-training for the convolutional neural network used for\nhole-filling. Furthermore, we demonstrate that points can be modeled as small\nGaussians during inference to further improve quality in extrapolated, e.g.,\nclose-up views of the scene. We design our implementations to be broadly\napplicable beyond INPC and systematically evaluate each modification in a\nseries of experiments. Our optimized INPC pipeline achieves up to 25% faster\ntraining, 2x faster rendering, and 20% reduced VRAM usage paired with slight\nimage quality improvements."}

Cognitive science\nsuggests that humans rely on working memory to buffer short-lived\nrepresentations for immediate control, while the hippocampal system preserves\nverbatim episodic details and semantic gist of past experience for long-term\nmemory. Inspired by these mechanisms, we propose MemoryVLA, a\nCognition-Memory-Action framework for long-horizon robotic manipulation. A\npretrained VLM encodes the observation into perceptual and cognitive tokens\nthat form working memory, while a Perceptual-Cognitive Memory Bank stores\nlow-level details and high-level semantics consolidated from it. Working memory\nretrieves decision-relevant entries from the bank, adaptively fuses them with\ncurrent tokens, and updates the bank by merging redundancies. Using these\ntokens, a memory-conditioned diffusion action expert yields temporally aware\naction sequences. We evaluate MemoryVLA on 150+ simulation and real-world tasks\nacross three robots. On SimplerEnv-Bridge, Fractal, and LIBERO-5 suites, it\nachieves 71.9%, 72.7%, and 96.5% success rates, respectively, all outperforming\nstate-of-the-art baselines CogACT and pi-0, with a notable +14.6 gain on\nBridge. On 12 real-world tasks spanning general skills and long-horizon\ntemporal dependencies, MemoryVLA achieves 84.0% success rate, with long-horizon\ntasks showing a +26 improvement over state-of-the-art baseline.
