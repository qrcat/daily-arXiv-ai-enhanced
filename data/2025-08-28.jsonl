Like the Jacob's\nLadder toy, FlipWalker features two interconnected segments joined by flexible\ncables, enabling it to pivot and flip around singularities in a manner\nreminiscent of the toy's cascading motion. Actuation is provided by\nmotor-driven legs within each segment that push off either the ground or the\nopposing segment, depending on the robot's current configuration. A\nphysics-based model of the underactuated flipping dynamics is formulated to\nelucidate the critical design parameters governing forward motion and obstacle\nclearance or climbing. The untethered prototype weighs 0.78 kg, achieves a\nmaximum flipping speed of 0.2 body lengths per second.

This emphasis has two notable side\neffects: some edges are drawn with unnecessarily long sequences of segments and\nbends, and the overall drawing area may become excessively large. As a result,\nthe produced drawings often lack geometric uniformity. Moreover, orthogonal\ncrossings are known to have a limited impact on readability, suggesting that\ncrossing minimization may not always be the optimal goal. In this paper, we\nintroduce a methodology that 'subverts' the traditional TSM pipeline by\nfocusing on minimizing bends. Given a graph $G$, we ideally seek to construct a\nrectilinear drawing of $G$, that is, an orthogonal drawing with no bends. When\nnot possible, we incrementally subdivide the edges of $G$ by introducing dummy\nvertices that will (possibly) correspond to bends in the final drawing. This\nprocess continues until a rectilinear drawing of a subdivision of the graph is\nfound, after which the final coordinates are computed. We tackle the\n(NP-complete) rectilinear drawability problem by encoding it as a SAT formula\nand solving it with state-of-the-art SAT solvers. If the SAT formula is\nunsatisfiable, we use the solver's proof to determine which edge to subdivide.\nOur implementation, DOMUS, which is fairly simple, is evaluated through\nextensive experiments on small- to medium-sized graphs. The results show that\nit consistently outperforms OGDF's TSM-based approach across most standard\ngraph drawing metrics."}

This\nin-depth review presents a structured exploration of the state-of-the-art in\nLVLMs, systematically organized through a three-step research review process.\nFirst, we discuss the functioning of vision language models (VLMs) for object\ndetection, describing how these models harness natural language processing\n(NLP) and computer vision (CV) techniques to revolutionize object detection and\nlocalization. We then explain the architectural innovations, training\nparadigms, and output flexibility of recent LVLMs for object detection,\nhighlighting how they achieve advanced contextual understanding for object\ndetection. The review thoroughly examines the approaches used in integration of\nvisual and textual information, demonstrating the progress made in object\ndetection using VLMs that facilitate more sophisticated object detection and\nlocalization strategies. This review presents comprehensive visualizations\ndemonstrating LVLMs' effectiveness in diverse scenarios including localization\nand segmentation, and then compares their real-time performance, adaptability,\nand complexity to traditional deep learning systems. Based on the review, its\nis expected that LVLMs will soon meet or surpass the performance of\nconventional methods in object detection. The review also identifies a few\nmajor limitations of the current LVLM modes, proposes solutions to address\nthose challenges, and presents a clear roadmap for the future advancement in\nthis field. We conclude, based on this study, that the recent advancement in\nLVLMs have made and will continue to make a transformative impact on object\ndetection and robotic applications in the future."}

Our benchmark comprises 438 manually curated videos spanning multiple\ntypes, yielding 1,177 high-quality multiple-choice questions and 120 open-ended\nquestions, validated for their effectiveness in exposing positional bias. Based\non these, we evaluate 27 state-of-the-art LVLMs, including both commercial and\nopen-source models. Our findings reveal significant positional biases in many\nleading open-source models, typically exhibiting head or neighbor-content\npreferences. In contrast, commercial models such as Gemini2.5-Pro show\nimpressive, consistent performance across entire video sequences.

As a result, VLMs receive sparse visual signals and often\nlearn to prioritize language-based reasoning over visual perception. To\nmitigate this, some existing methods add visual supervision using human\nannotations or distilled labels from external large models.

Consequently, many works\nhave sought to mitigate such semantic misalignments, typically via\ninference-time schemes that modify the attention layers of the denoising\nnetworks. However, prior work has mostly utilized coarse metrics, such as the\ncosine similarity between text and image CLIP embeddings, or human evaluations,\nwhich are challenging to conduct on a larger-scale. In this work, we perform a\ncase study on colors -- a fundamental attribute commonly associated with\nobjects in text prompts, which offer a rich test bed for rigorous evaluation.\nOur analysis reveals that pretrained models struggle to generate images that\nfaithfully reflect multiple color attributes-far more so than with single-color\nprompts-and that neither inference-time techniques nor existing editing methods\nreliably resolve these semantic misalignments.
