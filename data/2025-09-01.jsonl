The first\nstrategy introduces an effective rank regularization, motivated by recent\nstudies on Gaussian primitive structures. This regularization discourages\nextreme anisotropy-specifically, \"needle-like\" shapes-by favoring more\nbalanced, \"disk-like\" forms that are better suited for stable surface\nreconstruction. The second strategy integrates a neural Signed Distance\nFunction (SDF) into the optimization process. The SDF is regularized with an\nEikonal loss to maintain proper distance properties and provides a continuous\nglobal surface prior, guiding Gaussians toward better alignment with the\nunderlying geometry.

We derive a strategy based on optimal transport that not only\nprovides minimum cost paths from robots to targets but also guarantees\nnon-overlapping trajectories.

To address\nthis critical bottleneck, this paper introduces Print2Volume, a novel framework\nfor generating realistic, synthetic OCT-based 3D fingerprints from 2D\nfingerprint image. Our framework operates in three sequential stages: (1) a 2D\nstyle transfer module that converts a binary fingerprint into a grayscale\nimages mimicking the style of a Z-direction mean-projected OCT scan; (2) a 3D\nStructure Expansion Network that extrapolates the 2D im-age into a plausible 3D\nanatomical volume; and (3) an OCT Realism Refiner, based on a 3D GAN, that\nrenders the structural volume with authentic textures, speckle noise, and other\nimaging characteristics.

We propose a latent\ndiffusion model to reconstruct a complete 3D scene with Gaussian splats,\nincluding the occluded parts, from only a single image during inference.\nCompleting the unobserved surfaces of a scene is challenging due to the\nambiguity of the plausible surfaces. Conventional methods use a\nregression-based formulation to predict a single \"mode\" for occluded and\nout-of-frustum surfaces, leading to blurriness, implausibility, and failure to\ncapture multiple possible explanations.

They\nattribute hallucinations to factors such as strong language priors, missing\nframes, or vision-language biases introduced by the visual encoder. While these\ncauses indeed account for most hallucinations in short videos, they still\noversimplify the cause of hallucinations. Sometimes, models generate incorrect\noutputs but with correct frame-level semantics. We refer to this type of\nhallucination as Semantic Aggregation Hallucination (SAH), which arises during\nthe process of aggregating frame-level semantics into event-level semantic\ngroups. Given that SAH becomes particularly critical in long videos due to\nincreased semantic complexity across multiple events, it is essential to\nseparate and thoroughly investigate the causes of this type of hallucination.\nTo address the above issues, we introduce ELV-Halluc, the first benchmark\ndedicated to long-video hallucination, enabling a systematic investigation of\nSAH. Our experiments confirm the existence of SAH and show that it increases\nwith semantic complexity. Additionally, we find that models are more prone to\nSAH on rapidly changing semantics. Moreover, we discuss potential approaches to\nmitigate SAH.

To address this, we propose the\nHierarchical Cross-Granularity Contrastive and Matching learning (HCCM)\nframework with two components: (1) Region-Global Image-Text Contrastive\nLearning (RG-ITC), which avoids precise scene partitioning and captures\nhierarchical local-to-global semantics by contrasting local visual regions with\nglobal text and vice versa; (2) Region-Global Image-Text Matching (RG-ITM),\nwhich dispenses with rigid constraints and instead evaluates local semantic\nconsistency within global cross-modal representations, enhancing compositional\nreasoning.

The rapid\nadvancement of VLMs accelerates the development of GUI agents, owing to their\npowerful capabilities in visual understanding and task planning. However,\nbuilding a GUI agent remains a challenging task due to the scarcity of\noperation trajectories, the availability of interactive infrastructure, and the\nlimitation of initial capabilities in foundation models. In this work, we\nintroduce UItron, an open-source foundational model for automatic GUI agents,\nfeaturing advanced GUI perception, grounding, and planning capabilities. UItron\nhighlights the necessity of systemic data engineering and interactive\ninfrastructure as foundational components for advancing GUI agent development.\nIt not only systematically studies a series of data engineering strategies to\nenhance training effects, but also establishes an interactive environment\nconnecting both Mobile and PC devices. In training, UItron adopts supervised\nfinetuning over perception and planning tasks in various GUI scenarios, and\nthen develop a curriculum reinforcement learning framework to enable complex\nreasoning and exploration for online environments. As a result, UItron achieves\nsuperior performance in benchmarks of GUI perception, grounding, and planning.\nIn particular, UItron highlights the interaction proficiency with top-tier\nChinese mobile APPs, as we identified a general lack of Chinese capabilities\neven in state-of-the-art solutions.

Consequently, current DG evaluation may neither be sufficiently\nchallenging nor adequately test genuinely unseen data scenarios. To better\nassess the performance of CLIP on DG in-the-wild, a scenario where CLIP\nencounters challenging unseen data, we consider two approaches: (1) evaluating\non 33 diverse datasets with quantified out-of-distribution (OOD) scores after\nfine-tuning CLIP on ImageNet, and (2) using unlearning to make CLIP `forget'\nsome domains as an approximation. We observe that CLIP's performance\ndeteriorates significantly on more OOD datasets. To address this, we present\nCLIP-DCA (Disentangling Classification from enhanced domain Aware\nrepresentations).

In this paper, we are\ninterested in asking: \\textit{What if atypical unusual videos are exposed in\nthe learning process?} To this end, we collect a new video dataset consisting\nof various types of unusual atypical data (\\eg sci-fi, animation, \\etc). To\nstudy how such atypical data may benefit open-world learning, we feed them into\nthe model training process for representation learning. Focusing on three key\ntasks in open-world learning: out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, novel\ncategory discovery (NCD), and zero-shot action recognition (ZSAR), we found\nthat even straightforward learning approaches with atypical data consistently\nimprove performance across various settings. Furthermore, we found that\nincreasing the categorical diversity of the atypical samples further boosts OOD\ndetection performance. Additionally, in the NCD task, using a smaller yet more\nsemantically diverse set of atypical samples leads to better performance\ncompared to using a larger but more typical dataset.
