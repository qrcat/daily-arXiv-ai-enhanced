We formulate the slicing problem as an optimization task, in which\nparametric curves are computed to define both the slicing layers and the model\npartitioning through their tangent planes.

Although contemporary dehazing models have\ndemonstrated promising performance, few have thoroughly investigated\nhigh-resolution imagery. In such scenarios, practitioners often resort to\ndownsampling the input image or processing it in smaller patches, which leads\nto a notable performance degradation. This drop is primarily linked to the\ndifficulty of effectively combining global contextual information with\nlocalized, fine-grained details as the spatial resolution grows. In this\nchapter, we propose a novel framework, termed the Streamlined Global and Local\nFeatures Combinator (SGLC), to bridge this gap and enable robust dehazing for\nhigh-resolution inputs. Our approach is composed of two principal components:\nthe Global Features Generator (GFG) and the Local Features Enhancer (LFE). The\nGFG produces an initial dehazed output by focusing on broad contextual\nunderstanding of the scene. Subsequently, the LFE refines this preliminary\noutput by enhancing localized details and pixel-level features, thereby\ncapturing the interplay between global appearance and local structure. To\nevaluate the effectiveness of SGLC, we integrated it with the Uformer\narchitecture, a state-of-the-art dehazing model. Experimental results on\nhigh-resolution datasets reveal a considerable improvement in peak\nsignal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) when employing SGLC, indicating its potency in\naddressing haze in large-scale imagery. Moreover, the SGLC design is\nmodel-agnostic, allowing any dehazing network to be augmented with the proposed\nglobal-and-local feature fusion mechanism. Through this strategy, practitioners\ncan harness both scene-level cues and granular details, significantly improving\nvisual fidelity in high-resolution environments."}

The\nframework comprises state estimation for both the autonomous vehicle (AV) and\nHDVs, trajectory generation using double quintic polynomials, real-time TTC\ncomputation, and adaptive trajectory evaluation. To the best of our knowledge,\nthis is the first work to embed an analytic TTC penalty directly into the\nclosed-form double-quintic polynomial solver, enabling real-time safety-aware\ntrajectory generation without post-hoc validation. Extensive simulations\nconducted under diverse traffic scenarios demonstrate the safety, efficiency,\nand comfort of the proposed approach compared to conventional methods such as\nquintic polynomials, Bezier curves, and B-splines. The results highlight that\nthe improved method not only avoids collisions but also ensures smooth\ntransitions and adaptive decision-making in dynamic environments. This work\nbridges the gap between model-based and adaptive trajectory planning\napproaches, offering a stable solution for real-world autonomous driving\napplications."}

However,\ndue to the scarcity of point cloud data, pre-training large 3D models remains a\nchallenging task. While many efforts have been made to apply pre-trained visual\nmodels to 3D domains through \"high-to-low\" mapping, these approaches often lead\nto the loss of spatial geometries and lack a generalizable framework for\nadapting any modality to 3D. This paper, therefore, attempts to directly\nleverage point features to calibrate the heterogeneous foundation model of any\nmodality for 3D point cloud analysis. Specifically, we propose the Adaptive\nPoint-Prompt Tuning (APPT) method, which fine-tunes pre-trained models with a\nmodest number of parameters, enabling direct point cloud processing without\nheterogeneous mappings. We convert raw point clouds into point embeddings by\naggregating local geometry to capture spatial features followed by linear\nlayers to ensure seamless utilization of frozen pre-trained models. Given the\ninherent disorder of point clouds, in contrast to the structured nature of\nimages and language, we employ a permutation-invariant feature to capture the\nrelative positions of point embeddings, thereby obtaining point tokens enriched\nwith location information to optimize self-attention mechanisms. To calibrate\nself-attention across source domains of any modality to 3D and reduce\ncomputational overhead, we introduce a prompt generator that shares weights\nwith the point embedding module, dynamically producing point-prompts without\nadding additional parameters. These prompts are then concatenated into a frozen\nfoundation model, providing rich global structural information and compensating\nfor the lack of structural context in the heterogeneous data."}

We propose to\nreorganize preference-labeled critic datasets into verifiable training signals\nand perform reinforcement learning directly on a base generative model,\nproducing LLaVA-Critic-R1, a multimodal critic trained to optimize preference\njudgments while retaining full generation ability. Surprisingly,\nLLaVA-Critic-R1 emerges not only as a top-performing critic but also as a\ncompetitive policy model -- matching or surpassing specialized reasoning VLMs\ntrained with in-domain data across 26 visual reasoning and understanding\nbenchmarks, with an average gain of +5.7% over its base model (Qwen-2.5-VL-7B).\nExtending this approach to existing strong reasoning VLMs yields\nLLaVA-Critic-R1+, which further advances policy performance without sacrificing\ncritic quality, achieving a SoTA performance of 71.9 on MMMU at the 7B scale.\nFinally, we show that the enhanced critic ability benefits inference: applying\nself-critique at test time yields an average +13.8% improvement on five\nrepresentative reasoning tasks without additional training. Our results reveal\nthat RL training on critic data can produce a unified model excelling at both\nevaluation and generation, offering a simple path toward scalable,\nself-improving multimodal systems."}

The VLM-based perception module employs a\nSigLIP2-driven architecture with a bidirectional cross-attention fusion\nmechanism and weight-decomposed low-rank adaptation (DoRA) fine-tuning to\nachieve language-conditioned fine-grained visual grounding. Experiments in both\nsimulation and real-world settings demonstrate the method's effectiveness. In\nsimulation, it outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 2.23, 1.87, and 33.3\non seen instructions, unseen instructions, and unseen tasks, respectively. On a\nreal robot, it robustly executes multi-step folding sequences from language\ninstructions across diverse cloth materials and configurations, demonstrating\nstrong generalization in practical scenarios.

Existing methods commonly\nfollow a two-step pipeline, where camera poses are first estimated and then 3D\nGaussians are optimized. Since blurring artifacts usually undermine pose\nestimation, pose errors could be accumulated to produce inferior reconstruction\nresults. To address this issue, we introduce a unified optimization framework\nby incorporating camera poses as learnable parameters complementary to 3DGS\nattributes for end-to-end optimization. Specifically, we recast camera and\nobject motion as per-primitive SE(3) affine transformations on 3D Gaussians and\nformulate a unified optimization objective. For stable optimization, we\nintroduce a three-stage training schedule that optimizes camera poses and\nGaussians alternatively.

While 3DGS excels on\nRGB data, naive per-band optimization of additional spectra yields poor\nreconstructions due to inconsistently appearing geometry in the spectral\ndomain. This problem is prominent, even though the actual geometry is the same,\nregardless of spectral modality. To investigate this, we evaluate three\nstrategies: 1) Separate per-band reconstruction with no shared structure. 2)\nSplitting optimization, in which we first optimize RGB geometry, copy it, and\nthen fit each new band to the model by optimizing both geometry and band\nrepresentation. 3) Joint, in which the modalities are jointly optimized,\noptionally with an initial RGB-only phase.

Despite the effectiveness, they have\noverlooked the potential noise in the labeled data, and mainly focus on\nstrategies to generate the reference prediction, while ignoring the\nheterogeneous values of different unlabeled pixels. We argue that effectively\nmining the rich information contained by the two predictions in the loss\nfunction, instead of the specific strategy to obtain a reference prediction, is\nmore essential for SSL, and propose a universal framework MetaSSL based on a\nspatially heterogeneous loss that assigns different weights to pixels by\nsimultaneously leveraging the uncertainty and consistency information between\nthe reference and supervised predictions. Specifically, we split the\npredictions on unlabeled data into four regions with decreasing weights in the\nloss: Unanimous and Confident (UC), Unanimous and Suspicious (US), Discrepant\nand Confident (DC), and Discrepant and Suspicious (DS), where an adaptive\nthreshold is proposed to distinguish confident predictions from suspicious\nones. The heterogeneous loss is also applied to labeled images for robust\nlearning considering the potential annotation noise. Our method is\nplug-and-play and general to most existing SSL methods. The experimental\nresults showed that it improved the segmentation performance significantly when\nintegrated with existing SSL frameworks on different datasets.

Unlike previous event-based\nensemble methods, which only utilise temporal resolution, our broader fusion\nstrategy delivers significantly improved robustness under varied lighting\nconditions (e.g., afternoon, sunset, night), achieving a 57% relative\nimprovement in Recall@1 across day-night transitions. We evaluate our approach\non two long-term driving datasets (with 8 km per traverse) without metric\nsubsampling, thereby preserving natural variations in speed and stop duration\nthat influence event density. We also conduct a comprehensive analysis of key\ndesign choices, including binning strategies, polarity handling, reconstruction\nmethods, and feature extractors, to identify the most critical components for\nrobust performance. Additionally, we propose a modification to the standard\nsequence matching framework that enhances performance at longer sequence\nlengths. To facilitate future research, we will release our codebase and\nbenchmarking framework."}

To address this issue, we introduce\nDraw-In-Mind (DIM), a dataset comprising two complementary subsets: (i)\nDIM-T2I, containing 14M long-context image-text pairs to enhance complex\ninstruction comprehension; and (ii) DIM-Edit, consisting of 233K\nchain-of-thought imaginations generated by GPT-4o, serving as explicit design\nblueprints for image edits.

Object-centric learning aims\nto mimic this process in an unsupervised manner. Recently, the slot\nattention-based framework has emerged as a leading approach in this area and\nhas been widely used in various downstream tasks. However, existing slot\nattention methods face two key limitations: (1) a lack of high-level semantic\ninformation. In current methods, image areas are assigned to slots based on\nlow-level features such as color and texture. This makes the model overly\nsensitive to low-level features and limits its understanding of object\ncontours, shapes, or other semantic characteristics. (2) The inability to\nfine-tune the encoder.

In medical imaging, the analysis of complex shapes - such as\norgans, tissues, or other anatomical structures - combined with the often\nanisotropic nature of high-dimensional images complicates these adaptations. In\nthis study, we critically examine the role of Positional Encodings (PEs),\narguing that commonly used approaches may be suboptimal for the specific\nchallenges of medical imaging. Sinusoidal Positional Encodings (SPEs) have\nproven effective in vision tasks, but they struggle to preserve Euclidean\ndistances in higher-dimensional spaces. Isotropic Fourier Feature Positional\nEncodings (IFPEs) have been proposed to better preserve Euclidean distances,\nbut they lack the ability to account for anisotropy in images. To address these\nlimitations, we propose Anisotropic Fourier Feature Positional Encoding (AFPE),\na generalization of IFPE that incorporates anisotropic, class-specific, and\ndomain-specific spatial dependencies. We systematically benchmark AFPE against\ncommonly used PEs on multi-label classification in chest X-rays, organ\nclassification in CT images, and ejection fraction regression in\nechocardiography. Our results demonstrate that choosing the correct PE can\nsignificantly improve model performance. We show that the optimal PE depends on\nthe shape of the structure of interest and the anisotropy of the data.

Prior methods\nfor articulation estimation have primarily focused on controlled settings,\nassuming either fixed camera viewpoints or direct observations of various\nobject states, which tend to fail in more realistic unconstrained environments.\nIn contrast, humans effortlessly infer articulation by watching others\nmanipulate objects. Inspired by this, we introduce ArtiPoint, a novel\nestimation framework that can infer articulated object models under dynamic\ncamera motion and partial observability. By combining deep point tracking with\na factor graph optimization framework, ArtiPoint robustly estimates articulated\npart trajectories and articulation axes directly from raw RGB-D videos. To\nfoster future research in this domain, we introduce Arti4D, the first\nego-centric in-the-wild dataset that captures articulated object interactions\nat a scene level, accompanied by articulation labels and ground-truth camera\nposes. We benchmark ArtiPoint against a range of classical and learning-based\nbaselines, demonstrating its superior performance on Arti4D.

To encode the mesh structure, these methods derive positional\nembeddings, that heavily rely on eigenvalue decomposition based operations,\ne.g. on the Laplacian matrix, or on heat-kernel signatures, which are then\nconcatenated to the input features. This paper proposes a novel approach\ninspired by the explicit construction of the Hodge Laplacian operator in\nDiscrete Exterior Calculus as a product of discrete Hodge operators and\nexterior derivatives, i.e. $(L := \\star_0^{-1} d_0^T \\star_1 d_0)$. We adjust\nthe Transformer architecture in a novel deep learning layer that utilizes the\nmulti-head attention mechanism to approximate Hodge matrices $\\star_0$,\n$\\star_1$ and $\\star_2$ and learn families of discrete operators $L$ that act\non mesh vertices, edges and faces. Our approach results in a\ncomputationally-efficient architecture that achieves comparable performance in\nmesh segmentation and classification tasks, through a direct learning\nframework, while eliminating the need for costly eigenvalue decomposition\noperations or complex preprocessing operations."}

Recent Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) based facial models achieve fast,\nhigh-quality rendering but still depend solely on a mesh-based 3DMM prior for\nexpression control, limiting their ability to capture fine-grained geometry,\nexpressions, and full-head coverage. We introduce GRMM, the first full-head\nGaussian 3D morphable model that augments a base 3DMM with residual geometry\nand appearance components, additive refinements that recover high-frequency\ndetails such as wrinkles, fine skin texture, and hairline variations. GRMM\nprovides disentangled control through low-dimensional, interpretable parameters\n(e.g., identity shape, facial expressions) while separately modelling residuals\nthat capture subject- and expression-specific detail beyond the base model's\ncapacity. Coarse decoders produce vertex-level mesh deformations, fine decoders\nrepresent per-Gaussian appearance, and a lightweight CNN refines rasterised\nimages for enhanced realism, all while maintaining 75 FPS real-time rendering.\nTo learn consistent, high-fidelity residuals, we present EXPRESS-50, the first\ndataset with 60 aligned expressions across 50 identities, enabling robust\ndisentanglement of identity and expression in Gaussian-based 3DMMs. Across\nmonocular 3D face reconstruction, novel-view synthesis, and expression\ntransfer, GRMM surpasses state-of-the-art methods in fidelity and expression\naccuracy while delivering interactive real-time performance."}

In\ncontrast, humans, living in a 3D world, depend more on physical properties-such\nas distance, size, and shape-than on texture when interacting with objects.\nSince such 3D geometric information can be acquired from widely available depth\ncameras, it appears feasible to endow robots with similar perceptual\ncapabilities. Our pilot study found that using depth cameras for manipulation\nis challenging, primarily due to their limited accuracy and susceptibility to\nvarious types of noise. In this work, we propose Camera Depth Models (CDMs) as\na simple plugin on daily-use depth cameras, which take RGB images and raw depth\nsignals as input and output denoised, accurate metric depth. To achieve this,\nwe develop a neural data engine that generates high-quality paired data from\nsimulation by modeling a depth camera's noise pattern. Our results show that\nCDMs achieve nearly simulation-level accuracy in depth prediction, effectively\nbridging the sim-to-real gap for manipulation tasks. Notably, our experiments\ndemonstrate, for the first time, that a policy trained on raw simulated depth,\nwithout the need for adding noise or real-world fine-tuning, generalizes\nseamlessly to real-world robots on two challenging long-horizon tasks involving\narticulated, reflective, and slender objects, with little to no performance\ndegradation.
