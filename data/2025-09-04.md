Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving has drawn tremendous attention recently. Many
works focus on using modular deep neural networks to construct the end-to-end
archi-tecture. However, whether using powerful large language models (LLM),
especially multi-modality Vision Language Models (VLM) could benefit the
end-to-end driving tasks remain a question. In our work, we demonstrate that
combining end-to-end architectural design and knowledgeable VLMs yield
impressive performance on the driving tasks. It is worth noting that our method
only uses a single camera and is the best camera-only solution across the
leaderboard, demonstrating the effectiveness of vision-based driving approach
and the potential for end-to-end driving tasks.

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have shown impressive
generalization across tasks using images and text modalities. While their
extension to video has enabled tasks such as video question answering and video
captioning, their pixel-level visual grounding abilities are less studied. In
this work, we raise the pertinent question of whether motion is used in
pixel-level visual grounding and whether video MLLMs can segment objects based
on natural language expressions describing their motion patterns. We identify
the shortcomings in the current benchmarks, where we show that a single frame
can often suffice for capturing the motion referring expression without any
temporal reasoning. To address this, we introduce four motion-centric probing
techniques, particularly designed for the visual grounding task, to study video
MLLMs' ability to identify true motion from a fake one and their ability to
grasp the motion order. Consequently, we provide a motion-centric benchmark,
MoCentric-Bench. It ensures that video MLLMs are evaluated towards leveraging
the interaction between motion and language rather than being dominated by
static appearance cues emphasized in existing visual grounding datasets. We
further establish strong single-image baselines that are on par with or
outperform prior methods. Finally, we explore simple motion-centric adaptation
techniques that provide state-of-the-art performance on our MoCentric-Bench.
Our motion-centric benchmark, evaluation and findings challenge future models
to improve dense spatiotemporal grounding and pixel-level understanding within
videos. Code and datasets will be made publicly available at

Abstract: Colon cancer also known as Colorectal cancer, is one of the most malignant
types of cancer worldwide. Early-stage detection of colon cancer is highly
crucial to prevent its deterioration. This research presents a hybrid
multi-scale deep learning architecture that synergizes capsule networks, graph
attention mechanisms, transformer modules, and residual learning to advance
colon cancer classification on the Lung and Colon Cancer Histopathological
Image Dataset (LC25000) dataset. The proposed model in this paper utilizes the
HG-TNet model that introduces a hybrid architecture that joins strength points
in transformers and convolutional neural networks to capture multi-scale
features in histopathological images. Mainly, a transformer branch extracts
global contextual bonds by partitioning the image into patches by
convolution-based patch embedding and then processing these patches through a
transformer encoder. Analogously, a dedicated CNN branch captures fine-grained,
local details through successive Incorporation these diverse features, combined
with a self-supervised rotation prediction objective, produce a robust
diagnostic representation that surpasses standard architectures in performance.
Results show better performance not only in accuracy or loss function but also
in these algorithms by utilizing capsule networks to preserve spatial orders
and realize how each element individually combines and forms whole structures.

Abstract: Aortic stenosis (AS) is a life-threatening condition caused by a narrowing of
the aortic valve, leading to impaired blood flow. Despite its high prevalence,
access to echocardiography (echo), the gold-standard diagnostic tool, is often
limited due to resource constraints, particularly in rural and underserved
areas. Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) offers a more accessible alternative
but is restricted by operator expertise and the challenge of selecting the most
relevant imaging views. To address this, we propose a reinforcement learning
(RL)-driven active video acquisition framework that dynamically selects each
patient's most informative echo videos. Unlike traditional methods that rely on
a fixed set of videos, our approach continuously evaluates whether additional
imaging is needed, optimizing both accuracy and efficiency. Tested on data from
2,572 patients, our method achieves 80.6% classification accuracy while using
only 47% of the echo videos compared to a full acquisition. These results
demonstrate the potential of active feature acquisition to enhance AS
diagnosis, making echocardiographic assessments more efficient, scalable, and
personalized. Our source code is available at:

Abstract: There is a growing interest in the development of lidar-based autonomous
mobility and Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). To operate and research
on lidar data, researchers often develop code specific to application niche.
This approach leads to duplication of efforts across studies that, in many
cases, share multiple methodological steps such as data input/output (I/O),
pre/post processing, and common algorithms in multi-stage solutions. Moreover,
slight changes in data, algorithms, and/or research focus may force major
revisions in the code. To address these challenges, we present LiGuard, an
open-source software framework that allows researchers to: 1) rapidly develop
code for their lidar-based projects by providing built-in support for data I/O,
pre/post processing, and commonly used algorithms, 2) interactively
add/remove/reorder custom algorithms and adjust their parameters, and 3)
visualize results for classification, detection, segmentation, and tracking
tasks. Moreover, because it creates all the code files in structured
directories, it allows easy sharing of entire projects or even the individual
components to be reused by other researchers. The effectiveness of LiGuard is
demonstrated via case studies.

Abstract: LiDAR-based perception in intelligent transportation systems (ITS), for tasks
such as object detection, tracking, and semantic and instance segmentation, is
predominantly solved by deep neural network models which often require
large-scale labeled datasets during training to achieve generalization.
However, creating these datasets is costly. time consuming and require human
labor before the datasets are ready for training models. This hinders
scalability of the LiDAR-based perception systems in ITS. Sim2Real learning
offers scalable alternative, however, its effectiveness is dependent on the
fidelity of the source simulation(s) to real-world, in terms of environment
structure, actor dynamics, and sensor emulations. In response, this paper
introduces a rigorous and reproducible methodology for creating large-scale,
high-quality synthetic datasets using High-Fidelity Digital Twins (HiFi DTs).
The proposed workflow outlines the steps, tools, and best practices for
digitally replicating real-world environments, encompassing static geometry
modeling, road infrastructure replication, and dynamic traffic scenario
generation. Leveraging open-source and readily available resources such as
satellite imagery and OpenStreetMap data, alongside specific sensor
configurations, this paper provides practical, detailed guidance for
constructing robust synthetic environments. These environments subsequently
facilitate scalable, cost-effective, and diverse dataset generation, forming a
reliable foundation for robust Sim2Real learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LiDAR感知模型在模拟环境中训练后在真实世界数据上表现不佳的问题，这是由于模拟与现实数据分布之间的差异导致的域偏移。Sim2Real域迁移为智能交通系统中的感知应用提供了成本效益高且可扩展的解决方案。

Method: 提出HiFi DT框架，包含真实世界背景几何、车道级路网拓扑和传感器特定规格与安装位置。形式化了Sim2Real学习中的域适配挑战，并提出了一种系统的模拟环境构建方法以生成域内合成数据。使用多种指标（CD、MMD、EMD、FD）在原始输入和潜在特征层面量化合成与真实数据的分布对齐程度。

Conclusion: 高保真数字双胞框架能够有效缩小Sim2Real域差距离，为真实世界智能交通系统提供了可靠的基于模拟的LiDAR感知解决方案。这些发现强调了数字双胞在推进模拟基感知技术应用中的重要作用。

Abstract: Sim2Real domain transfer offers a cost-effective and scalable approach for
developing LiDAR-based perception (e.g., object detection, tracking,
segmentation) in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). However, perception
models trained in simulation often under perform on real-world data due to
distributional shifts. To address this Sim2Real gap, this paper proposes a
high-fidelity digital twin (HiFi DT) framework that incorporates real-world
background geometry, lane-level road topology, and sensor-specific
specifications and placement. We formalize the domain adaptation challenge
underlying Sim2Real learning and present a systematic method for constructing
simulation environments that yield in-domain synthetic data. An off-the-shelf
3D object detector is trained on HiFi DT-generated synthetic data and evaluated
on real data. Our experiments show that the DT-trained model outperforms the
equivalent model trained on real data by 4.8%. To understand this gain, we
quantify distributional alignment between synthetic and real data using
multiple metrics, including Chamfer Distance (CD), Maximum Mean Discrepancy
(MMD), Earth Mover's Distance (EMD), and Fr'echet Distance (FD), at both
raw-input and latent-feature levels. Results demonstrate that HiFi DTs
substantially reduce domain shift and improve generalization across diverse
evaluation scenarios. These findings underscore the significant role of digital
twins in enabling reliable, simulation-based LiDAR perception for real-world
ITS applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医学影像中模型在真实世界分布偏移下泛化能力差的问题，特别是在糖尿病视网膜病变分类中应对不同域的数据分布变化。

Result: 在四个公开数据集上验证，跨域设置中准确率提升5.2%，比基线ViT模型提高6%。符号模型在MDG中达到63.67%平均准确率，神经符号集成在SDG场景中取得最高准确率。病变特征准确率达84.65%，显著优于纯神经方法。

Conclusion: 神经符号集成是构建临床鲁棒、域不变医学AI系统的有前景范式，符号组件不仅增强可解释性，还作为有效正则化器提升性能。

Abstract: Domain generalization remains a critical challenge in medical imaging, where
models trained on single sources often fail under real-world distribution
shifts. We propose KG-DG, a neuro-symbolic framework for diabetic retinopathy
(DR) classification that integrates vision transformers with expert-guided
symbolic reasoning to enable robust generalization across unseen domains. Our
approach leverages clinical lesion ontologies through structured, rule-based
features and retinal vessel segmentation, fusing them with deep visual
representations via a confidence-weighted integration strategy. The framework
addresses both single-domain generalization (SDG) and multi-domain
generalization (MDG) by minimizing the KL divergence between domain embeddings,
thereby enforcing alignment of high-level clinical semantics. Extensive
experiments across four public datasets (APTOS, EyePACS, Messidor-1,
Messidor-2) demonstrate significant improvements: up to a 5.2% accuracy gain in
cross-domain settings and a 6% improvement over baseline ViT models. Notably,
our symbolic-only model achieves a 63.67% average accuracy in MDG, while the
complete neuro-symbolic integration achieves the highest accuracy compared to
existing published baselines and benchmarks in challenging SDG scenarios.
Ablation studies reveal that lesion-based features (84.65% accuracy)
substantially outperform purely neural approaches, confirming that symbolic
components act as effective regularizers beyond merely enhancing
interpretability. Our findings establish neuro-symbolic integration as a
promising paradigm for building clinically robust, and domain-invariant medical
AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常依赖计算密集型且难以复现的复杂可变形或深度学习方案，而轻量级刚性框架在连续切片场景中足够但发展不足

Method: 集成染色条件预处理、分层粗到精相关策略、自适应核缩放和内置质量控制

Conclusion: STAR作为一个开源轻量级工具，为临床采用降低了门槛，并为下一代计算病理学的大规模配对数据准备提供了可复现的基线

Abstract: Registration of serial whole-slide histopathological images (WSIs) is
critical for enabling direct comparison across diverse stains and for preparing
paired datasets in artificial intelligence (AI) workflows such as virtual
staining and biomarker prediction. While existing methods often rely on complex
deformable or deep learning approaches that are computationally intensive and
difficult to reproduce, lightweight rigid frameworks-sufficient for many
consecutive-section scenarios-remain underdeveloped. We introduce STAR (Serial
Tissue Alignment for Rigid registration), a fast and robust open-source
framework for multi-WSI alignment. STAR integrates stain-conditioned
preprocessing with a hierarchical coarse-to-fine correlation strategy, adaptive
kernel scaling, and built-in quality control, achieving reliable rigid
registration across heterogeneous tissue types and staining protocols,
including hematoxylin-eosin (H&E), special histochemical stains (e.g., PAS,
PASM, Masson's), and immunohistochemical (IHC) markers (e.g., CD31, KI67).
Evaluated on the ANHIR 2019 and ACROBAT 2022 datasets spanning multiple organs
and scanning conditions, STAR consistently produced stable alignments within
minutes per slide, demonstrating robustness to cross-stain variability and
partial tissue overlap. Beyond benchmarks, we present case studies on H&E-IHC
alignment, construction of multi-IHC panels, and typical failure modes,
underscoring both utility and limitations. Released as an open and lightweight
tool, STAR provides a reproducible baseline that lowers the barrier for
clinical adoption and enables large-scale paired data preparation for
next-generation computational pathology.

Abstract: Multimodal industrial surface defect detection (MISDD) aims to identify and
locate defect in industrial products by fusing RGB and 3D modalities. This
article focuses on modality-missing problems caused by uncertain sensors
availability in MISDD. In this context, the fusion of multiple modalities
encounters several troubles, including learning mode transformation and
information vacancy. To this end, we first propose cross-modal prompt learning,
which includes: i) the cross-modal consistency prompt serves the establishment
of information consistency of dual visual modalities; ii) the modality-specific
prompt is inserted to adapt different input patterns; iii) the missing-aware
prompt is attached to compensate for the information vacancy caused by dynamic
modalities-missing. In addition, we propose symmetric contrastive learning,
which utilizes text modality as a bridge for fusion of dual vision modalities.
Specifically, a paired antithetical text prompt is designed to generate binary
text semantics, and triple-modal contrastive pre-training is offered to
accomplish multimodal learning. Experiment results show that our proposed
method achieves 73.83% I-AUROC and 93.05% P-AUROC with a total missing rate 0.7
for RGB and 3D modalities (exceeding state-of-the-art methods 3.84% and 5.58%
respectively), and outperforms existing approaches to varying degrees under
different missing types and rates. The source code will be available at

*Victor Solomon,Piet Martens,Jingyu Liu,Rafal Angryk*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EdgeAttNet是一种基于U-Net的太阳灯丝分割架构，通过引入可学习的边缘图来改进自注意力机制，显著提升了细尺度灯丝结构（特别是倒刺）的分割精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在H-alpha观测中难以准确分割太阳灯丝，特别是无法有效捕捉细尺度结构和倒刺，主要原因是长程依赖建模能力和空间细节处理能力有限。

Method: 在U-Net骨干网络上引入直接从输入图像推导的可学习边缘图，通过将边缘信息线性变换到注意力Key和Query矩阵中，指导瓶颈处的自注意力机制更好地捕捉灯丝边界和倒刺结构。

Result: 在MAGFILO数据集上，EdgeAttNet超越了U-Net和其他基于U-Net的transformer基线，获得了更高的分割精度和显著更好的倒刺识别能力，同时推理速度更快。

Conclusion: 通过将结构先验显式整合到注意力计算中，EdgeAttNet在减少可训练参数的同时增强了空间敏感性和分割准确性，适合实际部署应用。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of solar filaments in H-alpha observations is critical
for determining filament chirality, a key factor in the behavior of Coronal
Mass Ejections (CMEs). However, existing methods often fail to capture
fine-scale filament structures, particularly barbs, due to a limited ability to
model long-range dependencies and spatial detail.
  We propose EdgeAttNet, a segmentation architecture built on a U-Net backbone
by introducing a novel, learnable edge map derived directly from the input
image. This edge map is incorporated into the model by linearly transforming
the attention Key and Query matrices with the edge information, thereby guiding
the self-attention mechanism at the network's bottleneck to more effectively
capture filament boundaries and barbs. By explicitly integrating this
structural prior into the attention computations, EdgeAttNet enhances spatial
sensitivity and segmentation accuracy while reducing the number of trainable
parameters.
  Trained end-to-end, EdgeAttNet outperforms U-Net and other U-Net-based
transformer baselines on the MAGFILO dataset. It achieves higher segmentation
accuracy and significantly better recognition of filament barbs, with faster
inference performance suitable for practical deployment.

encoder, trained via self-supervised learning with hard-negative mining, with a
scalable k-means + HNSW retrieval stack that supplies scene-aligned exemplars.
Retrieved priors are embedded into chain-of-thought (CoT) prompts with explicit
planning constraints, while a triple-stage fine-tuning schedule incrementally
aligns the language head to metric spatial cues, physically feasible motion,
and temporally conditioned front-view planning. Evaluated on nuScenes dataset,
KEPT achieves state-of-the-art performance across open-loop protocols: under
NoAvg, it achieves 0.70m average L2 with a 0.21\% collision rate; under TemAvg
with lightweight ego status, it attains 0.31m average L2 and a 0.07\% collision
rate. Ablation studies show that all three fine-tuning stages contribute
complementary benefits, and that using Top-2 retrieved exemplars yields the
best accuracy-safety trade-off. The k-means-clustered HNSW index delivers
sub-millisecond retrieval latency, supporting practical deployment. These
results indicate that retrieval-augmented, CoT-guided VLMs offer a promising,
data-efficient pathway toward interpretable and trustworthy autonomous driving.

Conclusion: InstaDA通过双智能体协作有效增强了实例分割数据集，无需额外训练，在性能提升和数据多样性方面表现出色

Abstract: Acquiring high-quality instance segmentation data is challenging due to the
labor-intensive nature of the annotation process and significant class
imbalances within datasets. Recent studies have utilized the integration of
Copy-Paste and diffusion models to create more diverse datasets. However, these
studies often lack deep collaboration between large language models (LLMs) and
diffusion models, and underutilize the rich information within the existing
training data. To address these limitations, we propose InstaDA, a novel,
training-free Dual-Agent system designed to augment instance segmentation
datasets. First, we introduce a Text-Agent (T-Agent) that enhances data
diversity through collaboration between LLMs and diffusion models. This agent
features a novel Prompt Rethink mechanism, which iteratively refines prompts
based on the generated images. This process not only fosters collaboration but
also increases image utilization and optimizes the prompts themselves.
Additionally, we present an Image-Agent (I-Agent) aimed at enriching the
overall data distribution. This agent augments the training set by generating
new instances conditioned on the training images. To ensure practicality and
efficiency, both agents operate as independent and automated workflows,
enhancing usability. Experiments conducted on the LVIS 1.0 validation set
indicate that InstaDA achieves significant improvements, with an increase of
+4.0 in box average precision (AP) and +3.3 in mask AP compared to the
baseline. Furthermore, it outperforms the leading model, DiverGen, by +0.3 in
box AP and +0.1 in mask AP, with a notable +0.7 gain in box AP on common
categories and mask AP gains of +0.2 on common categories and +0.5 on frequent
categories.

Motivation: 现有的原型方法通常为支持图像生成单一全局原型来匹配查询图像，忽略了类内变化，导致性能受限

Method: 提出自引导原型增强网络(SPENet)，包含多级原型生成模块(同时生成全局原型和自适应数量的局部原型)和查询引导的局部原型增强模块(通过查询图像指导自适应优化支持原型)

Result: 在三个公开医学数据集上的大量实验表明，SPENet超越了现有的最先进方法，取得了优越的性能

Conclusion: SPENet通过多粒度原型匹配和查询引导的原型增强，有效解决了少样本医学图像分割中的类内变化问题，展现出优异的性能

Abstract: Few-Shot Medical Image Segmentation (FSMIS) aims to segment novel classes of
medical objects using only a few labeled images. Prototype-based methods have
made significant progress in addressing FSMIS. However, they typically generate
a single global prototype for the support image to match with the query image,
overlooking intra-class variations. To address this issue, we propose a
Self-guided Prototype Enhancement Network (SPENet). Specifically, we introduce
a Multi-level Prototype Generation (MPG) module, which enables
multi-granularity measurement between the support and query images by
simultaneously generating a global prototype and an adaptive number of local
prototypes. Additionally, we observe that not all local prototypes in the
support image are beneficial for matching, especially when there are
substantial discrepancies between the support and query images. To alleviate
this issue, we propose a Query-guided Local Prototype Enhancement (QLPE)
module, which adaptively refines support prototypes by incorporating guidance
from the query image, thus mitigating the negative effects of such
discrepancies. Extensive experiments on three public medical datasets
demonstrate that SPENet outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods,
achieving superior performance.

Result: SOPSeg在小物体分割任务上超过现有方法，并基于SODA-A构建了全面的小物体实例分割数据集

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了远感小物体分割的技术挑战，提供了高效的数据集构建方案，将为远感应用领域提供支持

Abstract: Extracting small objects from remote sensing imagery plays a vital role in
various applications, including urban planning, environmental monitoring, and
disaster management. While current research primarily focuses on small object
detection, instance segmentation for small objects remains underexplored, with
no dedicated datasets available. This gap stems from the technical challenges
and high costs of pixel-level annotation for small objects. While the Segment
Anything Model (SAM) demonstrates impressive zero-shot generalization, its
performance on small-object segmentation deteriorates significantly, largely
due to the coarse 1/16 feature resolution that causes severe loss of fine
spatial details. To this end, we propose SOPSeg, a prompt-based framework
specifically designed for small object segmentation in remote sensing imagery.
It incorporates a region-adaptive magnification strategy to preserve
fine-grained details, and employs a customized decoder that integrates edge
prediction and progressive refinement for accurate boundary delineation.
Moreover, we introduce a novel prompting mechanism tailored to the oriented
bounding boxes widely adopted in remote sensing applications. SOPSeg
outperforms existing methods in small object segmentation and facilitates
efficient dataset construction for remote sensing tasks. We further construct a
comprehensive small object instance segmentation dataset based on SODA-A, and
will release both the model and dataset to support future research.

Abstract: Recent studies on deep watermarking have predominantly focused on
in-processing watermarking, which integrates the watermarking process into
image generation. However, post-processing watermarking, which embeds
watermarks after image generation, offers more flexibility. It can be applied
to outputs from any generative model (e.g. GANs, diffusion models) without
needing access to the model's internal structure. It also allows users to embed
unique watermarks into individual images. Therefore, this study focuses on
post-processing watermarking and enhances its robustness by incorporating an
ensemble attack network during training. We construct various versions of
attack networks using CNN and Transformer in both spatial and frequency domains
to investigate how each combination influences the robustness of the
watermarking model. Our results demonstrate that combining a CNN-based attack
network in the spatial domain with a Transformer-based attack network in the
frequency domain yields the highest robustness in watermarking models.
Extensive evaluation on the WAVES benchmark, using average bit accuracy as the
metric, demonstrates that our ensemble attack network significantly enhances
the robustness of baseline watermarking methods under various stress tests. In
particular, for the Regeneration Attack defined in WAVES, our method improves
StegaStamp by 18.743%. The code is released

TL;DR: LVLMs存在将文本输入误认为图像内容的幻觉问题，研究发现特定FFN神经元能识别视觉缺失，基于此开发了检测模块和改进方法，有效减少错误响应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在处理文本和视觉输入时，经常错误地将文本概念视为图像内容，导致产生不准确的响应，需要解决这种幻觉问题。

Method: 识别出特定的视觉缺失感知(VA)神经元，开发检测模块分类输入token是否视觉接地，通过重新解释问题提示或替换检测到的缺失token来改进输出。

Result: 实验表明该方法有效减轻了模型错误假定文本输入视觉存在的倾向，并在各种LVLM中具有通用性。

Conclusion: 通过利用内部神经元激活模式，可以系统性地检测和纠正LVLMs的视觉接地错误，提高模型输出的准确性。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) generate contextually relevant responses
by jointly interpreting visual and textual inputs. However, our finding reveals
they often mistakenly perceive text inputs lacking visual evidence as being
part of the image, leading to erroneous responses. In light of this finding, we
probe whether LVLMs possess an internal capability to determine if textual
concepts are grounded in the image, and discover a specific subset of
Feed-Forward Network (FFN) neurons, termed Visual Absence-aware (VA) neurons,
that consistently signal the visual absence through a distinctive activation
pattern. Leveraging these patterns, we develop a detection module that
systematically classifies whether an input token is visually grounded. Guided
by its prediction, we propose a method to refine the outputs by reinterpreting
question prompts or replacing the detected absent tokens during generation.
Extensive experiments show that our method effectively mitigates the models'
tendency to falsely presume the visual presence of text input and its
generality across various LVLMs.

Result: 在两个整体和两个遮挡ReID基准测试上的综合实验证明了方法的有效性和通用性，结果达到或超过了当前最先进方法

Conclusion: 背景语义信息对行人重识别至关重要，提出的联合建模框架能有效抑制背景噪声并增强对身份相关前景线索的关注

Abstract: Person re-identification faces two core challenges: precisely locating the
foreground target while suppressing background noise and extracting
fine-grained features from the target region. Numerous visual-only approaches
address these issues by partitioning an image and applying attention modules,
yet they rely on costly manual annotations and struggle with complex
occlusions. Recent multimodal methods, motivated by CLIP, introduce semantic
cues to guide visual understanding. However, they focus solely on foreground
information, but overlook the potential value of background cues. Inspired by
human perception, we argue that background semantics are as important as the
foreground semantics in ReID, as humans tend to eliminate background
distractions while focusing on target appearance. Therefore, this paper
proposes an end-to-end framework that jointly models foreground and background
information within a dual-branch cross-modal feature extraction pipeline. To
help the network distinguish between the two domains, we propose an
intra-semantic alignment and inter-semantic adversarial learning strategy.
Specifically, we align visual and textual features that share the same
semantics across domains, while simultaneously penalizing similarity between
foreground and background features to enhance the network's discriminative
power. This strategy drives the model to actively suppress noisy background
regions and enhance attention toward identity-relevant foreground cues.
Comprehensive experiments on two holistic and two occluded ReID benchmarks
demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of the proposed method, with
results that match or surpass those of current state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: Accurate skin-lesion segmentation remains a key technical challenge for
computer-aided diagnosis of skin cancer. Convolutional neural networks, while
effective, are constrained by limited receptive fields and thus struggle to
model long-range dependencies. Vision Transformers capture global context, yet
their quadratic complexity and large parameter budgets hinder use on the

MedLiteNet, a lightweight CNN Transformer hybrid tailored for dermoscopic
segmentation that achieves high precision through hierarchical feature
extraction and multi-scale context aggregation. The encoder stacks depth-wise
Mobile Inverted Bottleneck blocks to curb computation, inserts a
bottleneck-level cross-scale token-mixing unit to exchange information between

Motivation: 条件扩散模型在图像处理领域进展显著，但其构建数据分布路径的特性使其难以利用多任务场景中任务间的内在相关性，在训练数据缺乏的病态任务中表现更差。传统静态条件控制也难以适应多任务场景的动态演化特性。

Method: 提出动态条件双扩散桥训练范式：1）将扩散过程和条件生成过程解耦，避免扩散模型对病态任务中监督数据的依赖；2）使用相同噪声调度生成的动态条件，逐步调整统计特性，自然嵌入时间相关信息，降低网络学习难度。

Conclusion: 该动态条件训练范式有效解决了条件扩散模型在多任务场景中的局限性，通过解耦扩散与条件生成过程以及使用动态条件，显著提升了病态多任务的处理性能。

Abstract: Conditional diffusion models have made impressive progress in the field of
image processing, but the characteristics of constructing data distribution
pathways make it difficult to exploit the intrinsic correlation between tasks
in multi-task scenarios, which is even worse in ill-posed tasks with a lack of
training data. In addition, traditional static condition control makes it
difficult for networks to learn in multi-task scenarios with its dynamically
evolving characteristics. To address these challenges, we propose a dynamic
conditional double diffusion bridge training paradigm to build a general
framework for ill-posed multi-tasks. Firstly, this paradigm decouples the
diffusion and condition generation processes, avoiding the dependence of the
diffusion model on supervised data in ill-posed tasks. Secondly, generated by
the same noise schedule, dynamic conditions are used to gradually adjust their
statistical characteristics, naturally embed time-related information, and
reduce the difficulty of network learning. We analyze the learning objectives
of the network under different conditional forms in the single-step denoising
process and compare the changes in its attention weights in the network,
demonstrating the superiority of our dynamic conditions. Taking dehazing and
visible-infrared fusion as typical ill-posed multi-task scenarios, we achieve
the best performance in multiple indicators on public datasets. The code has
been publicly released at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/DCDB-D3C2.

classify highly cursive and complex characters. The generator network produces
fake handwritten character images, which are then used to augment the training

the accuracy of convolutional neural networks decreases as character complexity
increases, but our proposed model, ADA-GAN, remains more robust and effective
for both cursive and complex characters.

Abstract: Intracranial aneurysms pose a significant clinical risk yet are difficult to

cross-domain feature-transfer approach that leverages the latent geometric
embeddings learned by TRELLIS, a generative model trained on large-scale
non-medical 3D datasets, to augment neural networks for aneurysm analysis. By
replacing conventional point normals or mesh descriptors with TRELLIS surface
features, we systematically enhance three downstream tasks: (i) classifying
aneurysms versus healthy vessels in the Intra3D dataset, (ii) segmenting
aneurysm and vessel regions on 3D meshes, and (iii) predicting time-evolving
blood-flow fields using a graph neural network on the AnXplore dataset. Our
experiments show that the inclusion of these features yields strong gains in
accuracy, F1-score and segmentation quality over state-of-the-art baselines,
and reduces simulation error by 15\%. These results illustrate the broader
potential of transferring 3D representations from general-purpose generative
models to specialized medical tasks.

Abstract: Face recognition systems are robust against environmental changes and noise,
and thus may be vulnerable to illegal authentication attempts using user face
photos, such as spoofing attacks. To prevent such spoofing attacks, it is
crucial to discriminate whether the input image is a live user image or a
spoofed image prior to the face recognition process. Most existing spoofing
attack detection methods utilize deep learning, which necessitates a
substantial amount of training data. Consequently, if malicious data is
injected into a portion of the training dataset, a specific spoofing attack may
be erroneously classified as live, leading to false positives.In this paper, we
propose a novel backdoor poisoning attack method to demonstrate the latent
threat of backdoor poisoning within face anti-spoofing detection. The proposed
method enables certain spoofing attacks to bypass detection by embedding
features extracted from the spoofing attack's face image into a live face image
without inducing any perceptible visual alterations.Through experiments
conducted on public datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed method
constitutes a realistic threat to existing spoofing attack detection systems.

TL;DR: CAIM-Net是一个从变化时刻推断变化区域的时间序列变化检测网络，通过三个关键步骤实现变化区域和变化时刻结果的一致性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法将变化区域检测和变化时刻识别作为独立任务处理，但变化区域可以从变化时刻推断出来，需要确保两者结果的一致性

Method: 包含三个关键步骤：差异提取与增强、粗粒度变化时刻提取、细粒度变化时刻提取与变化区域推断。使用轻量级编码器提取差异特征，边界增强卷积放大特征，时空相关性分析确定变化时刻，最后通过多尺度时间CAM模块推断变化区域

Result: 该方法能够同时指示变化发生的位置和时间，确保变化区域检测和变化时刻识别结果的一致性

Conclusion: CAIM-Net通过从变化时刻推断变化区域的方式，有效解决了时间序列变化检测中变化区域和变化时刻结果不一致的问题

Abstract: Time series change detection is a critical task for exploring ecosystem
dynamics using time series remote sensing images, because it can simultaneously
indicate where and when change occur. While deep learning has shown excellent
performance in this domain, it continues to approach change area detection and
change moment identification as distinct tasks. Given that change area can be
inferred from change moment, we propose a time series change detection network,
named CAIM-Net (Change Area Inference from Moment Network), to ensure
consistency between change area and change moment results. CAIM-Net infers
change area from change moment based on the intrinsic relationship between time
series analysis and spatial change detection. The CAIM-Net comprises three key
steps: Difference Extraction and Enhancement, Coarse Change Moment Extraction,
and Fine Change Moment Extraction and Change Area Inference. In the Difference
Extraction and Enhancement, a lightweight encoder with batch dimension stacking
is designed to rapidly extract difference features. Subsequently, boundary
enhancement convolution is applied to amplify these difference features. In the
Coarse Change Moment Extraction, the enhanced difference features from the
first step are used to spatiotemporal correlation analysis, and then two
distinct methods are employed to determine coarse change moments. In the Fine
Change Moment Extraction and Change Area Inference, a multiscale temporal Class
Activation Mapping (CAM) module first increases the weight of the
change-occurring moment from coarse change moments. Then the weighted change
moment is used to infer change area based on the fact that pixels with the
change moment must have undergone a change.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于梯度自反思的token影响估计方法，通过影响感知对比解码框架同时缓解多模态大语言模型中的文本-视觉偏差和共现偏差，无需额外资源即可有效减少幻觉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型存在文本-视觉偏差和共现偏差导致的幻觉问题，现有方法缺乏对实例间偏差水平波动的理解，需要一种无需额外资源的有效缓解方案。

Method: 使用梯度自反思方法估计不同类型token（视觉、提示、先前输出）的影响，检测物体相关视觉token，并将其整合到影响感知对比解码框架中。

Result: 在LLaVA-QA90上实现了高达92%的准确率提升，有效减少了幻觉现象。

Conclusion: 该方法能够同时缓解两种偏差类型，无需昂贵微调、额外模型或数据统计，为多模态大语言模型的幻觉问题提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Hallucinations in multimodal large language model are caused by the
text-visual bias and the co-occurrence bias. The former reflects an
over-reliance on text information in the decision-making process, while the
latter arises from the statistical object-pairing patterns abstracted from the
training data. Existing mitigation methods heuristically address these biases
without understanding the fluctuating bias level across the instances. We first
propose estimating the influence of respective token types (visual, prompt, and
previous outputs) using a gradient-based self-reflection method. The estimated
token influence further enables the detection of object-related visual tokens
and their integration into an influence-aware contrastive decoding framework to
mitigate both types of biases simultaneously. Our method operates without the
need for additional resources, such as costly fine-tuning, extra models, or
data statistics. Extensive experiments show it effectively reduces
hallucinations, achieving up to a 92% accuracy increase on LLaVA-QA90.

TL;DR: 提出GravityDB方法，通过引力场驱动的扩散桥解决手-物体交互中的穿透、间隙和手部变形问题，生成物理合理的交互状态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有手-物体姿态估计方法存在穿透、接触区域间隙问题，且难以捕捉手部在交互过程中的真实变形。

Method: 将手-物体交互建模为引力场驱动过程，使用基于引力场的扩散桥模拟可变形手部表面与刚性物体的交互，并引入文本语义信息指导引力场构建。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，该方法能有效消除穿透、确保稳定抓握，并捕捉真实的手部变形，生成物理合理的交互状态。

Conclusion: GravityDB方法通过引力场驱动和语义引导，成功解决了手-物体交互中的关键挑战，为复杂交互建模提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Existing reconstruction or hand-object pose estimation methods are capable of
producing coarse interaction states. However, due to the complex and diverse
geometry of both human hands and objects, these approaches often suffer from
interpenetration or leave noticeable gaps in regions that are supposed to be in
contact. Moreover, the surface of a real human hand undergoes non-negligible
deformations during interaction, which are difficult to capture and represent
with previous methods. To tackle these challenges, we formulate hand-object
interaction as an attraction-driven process and propose a Gravity-Field Based
Diffusion Bridge (GravityDB) to simulate interactions between a deformable hand
surface and rigid objects. Our approach effectively resolves the aforementioned
issues by generating physically plausible interactions that are free of
interpenetration, ensure stable grasping, and capture realistic hand
deformations. Furthermore, we incorporate semantic information from textual
descriptions to guide the construction of the gravitational field, enabling
more semantically meaningful interaction regions. Extensive qualitative and
quantitative experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of
our method.

TL;DR: 提出了TADM-3D模型，一种3D时间感知扩散模型，用于准确预测MRI脑部扫描的未来变化，通过预训练脑龄估计器和双向时间正则化来改进时间关系建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在三个主要局限：无法明确捕捉结构变化与时间间隔的关系、仅依赖扫描插值缺乏临床实用性、以及大多基于2D架构忽略3D解剖上下文。需要开发能够准确预测脑部病理进展的3D方法。

Method: 使用预训练的脑龄估计器(BAE)指导扩散模型生成反映预期年龄差异的MRI；提出Back-In-Time正则化(BITR)，通过双向训练（从基线到随访和从随访到基线）来增强时间感知能力。

Result: 在OASIS-3数据集上训练和评估，并在NACC数据集的外部测试集上验证了泛化性能。

Conclusion: TADM-3D能够准确预测脑部MRI的进展，通过脑龄估计器和双向正则化有效解决了现有方法的时间建模不足问题，具有更好的临床实用性。

Abstract: Generating realistic MRIs to accurately predict future changes in the
structure of brain is an invaluable tool for clinicians in assessing clinical
outcomes and analysing the disease progression at the patient level. However,
current existing methods present some limitations: (i) some approaches fail to
explicitly capture the relationship between structural changes and time
intervals, especially when trained on age-imbalanced datasets; (ii) others rely
only on scan interpolation, which lack clinical utility, as they generate
intermediate images between timepoints rather than future pathological
progression; and (iii) most approaches rely on 2D slice-based architectures,
thereby disregarding full 3D anatomical context, which is essential for
accurate longitudinal predictions. We propose a 3D Temporally-Aware Diffusion
Model (TADM-3D), which accurately predicts brain progression on MRI volumes. To
better model the relationship between time interval and brain changes, TADM-3D
uses a pre-trained Brain-Age Estimator (BAE) that guides the diffusion model in
the generation of MRIs that accurately reflect the expected age difference
between baseline and generated follow-up scans. Additionally, to further
improve the temporal awareness of TADM-3D, we propose the Back-In-Time
Regularisation (BITR), by training TADM-3D to predict bidirectionally from the
baseline to follow-up (forward), as well as from the follow-up to baseline
(backward). Although predicting past scans has limited clinical applications,
this regularisation helps the model generate temporally more accurate scans. We
train and evaluate TADM-3D on the OASIS-3 dataset, and we validate the
generalisation performance on an external test set from the NACC dataset. The
code will be available upon acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了两种新颖的损失函数（负中心线损失和简化拓扑损失）来改善生物医学分割任务中的结构连续性，特别是在信号丢失区域保持细长结构的连通性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在生物医学分割任务中，保持细长结构的连续性和长度比体素级精度更重要。现有方法在处理信号丢失时容易出现分割不连续的问题。

Method: 使用卷积神经网络（CNNs）结合两种新损失函数：负中心线损失和简化拓扑损失，并讨论了实验设计特征如下采样和间距校正。在3D光片荧光显微镜数据集上评估。

Result: 与标准CNNs和现有拓扑感知损失相比，新方法减少了每个实例的分割不连续数量，特别是在输入信号缺失区域，改善了实例长度计算的准确性。

Conclusion: 在损失函数设计中嵌入结构先验可以显著提高生物应用分割的可靠性，特别是在保持细长结构连续性方面。

Abstract: In many biomedical segmentation tasks, the preservation of elongated
structure continuity and length is more important than voxel-wise accuracy. We
propose two novel loss functions, Negative Centerline Loss and Simplified
Topology Loss, that, applied to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), help
preserve connectivity of output instances. Moreover, we discuss characteristics
of experiment design, such as downscaling and spacing correction, that help
obtain continuous segmentation masks. We evaluate our approach on a 3D
light-sheet fluorescence microscopy dataset of axon initial segments (AIS), a
task prone to discontinuity due to signal dropout. Compared to standard CNNs
and existing topology-aware losses, our methods reduce the number of
segmentation discontinuities per instance, particularly in regions with missing
input signal, resulting in improved instance length calculation in downstream
applications. Our findings demonstrate that structural priors embedded in the
loss design can significantly enhance the reliability of segmentation for
biological applications.

TL;DR: Count2Density是一种仅使用计数级标注训练密度估计模型的新方法，通过历史地图库和对比空间正则化来生成伪密度图，显著减少了标注需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统人群密度估计需要精细的位置级标注（每个人头上的点），这种标注既繁琐又耗时，限制了实际应用的可扩展性。

Method: 使用历史地图库生成伪密度图，通过无监督显著性估计提供初始空间先验，采用EMA更新策略，结合超几何分布采样和自监督对比空间正则化来增强空间感知。

Conclusion: Count2Density能够有效地从计数级标注中提取空间信息，为减少标注负担提供了可行的解决方案，在人群密度估计任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Crowd density estimation is a well-known computer vision task aimed at
estimating the density distribution of people in an image. The main challenge
in this domain is the reliance on fine-grained location-level annotations,
(i.e. points placed on top of each individual) to train deep networks.
Collecting such detailed annotations is both tedious, time-consuming, and poses
a significant barrier to scalability for real-world applications. To alleviate
this burden, we present Count2Density: a novel pipeline designed to predict
meaningful density maps containing quantitative spatial information using only
count-level annotations (i.e., total number of people) during training. To
achieve this, Count2Density generates pseudo-density maps leveraging past
predictions stored in a Historical Map Bank, thereby reducing confirmation
bias. This bank is initialised using an unsupervised saliency estimator to
provide an initial spatial prior and is iteratively updated with an EMA of
predicted density maps. These pseudo-density maps are obtained by sampling
locations from estimated crowd areas using a hypergeometric distribution, with
the number of samplings determined by the count-level annotations. To further
enhance the spatial awareness of the model, we add a self-supervised
contrastive spatial regulariser to encourage similar feature representations
within crowded regions while maximising dissimilarity with background regions.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms
cross-domain adaptation methods and achieves better results than recent
state-of-the-art approaches in semi-supervised settings across several
datasets. Additional analyses validate the effectiveness of each individual
component of our pipeline, confirming the ability of Count2Density to
effectively retrieve spatial information from count-level annotations and
enabling accurate subregion counting.

Motivation: 军事领域物体检测系统面临毒化攻击风险，但相关研究较少，需要研究其实际效果和有效检测方法

Method: 创建MilCivVeh军事车辆数据集，实施修改版BadDet毒化攻击，测试专门检测方法和异常检测方法，并提出自动编码器基础的AutoDetect方法

Result: 毒化攻击虽然可能成功，但需要毒化大量数据，实际应用性受限。AutoDetect方法在区分清洁和毒化样本方面表现优异，更节省时间和内存

Conclusion: 军事领域需要大规模代表性数据集来进一步评估毒化攻击风险，AutoDetect方法为补丁检测提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Poisoning attacks pose an increasing threat to the security and robustness of
Artificial Intelligence systems in the military domain. The widespread use of
open-source datasets and pretrained models exacerbates this risk. Despite the
severity of this threat, there is limited research on the application and
detection of poisoning attacks on object detection systems. This is especially
problematic in the military domain, where attacks can have grave consequences.
In this work, we both investigate the effect of poisoning attacks on military
object detectors in practice, and the best approach to detect these attacks. To
support this research, we create a small, custom dataset featuring military
vehicles: MilCivVeh. We explore the vulnerability of military object detectors
for poisoning attacks by implementing a modified version of the BadDet attack:
a patch-based poisoning attack. We then assess its impact, finding that while a
positive attack success rate is achievable, it requires a substantial portion
of the data to be poisoned -- raising questions about its practical
applicability. To address the detection challenge, we test both specialized
poisoning detection methods and anomaly detection methods from the visual
industrial inspection domain. Since our research shows that both classes of
methods are lacking, we introduce our own patch detection method: AutoDetect, a
simple, fast, and lightweight autoencoder-based method. Our method shows
promising results in separating clean from poisoned samples using the
reconstruction error of image slices, outperforming existing methods, while
being less time- and memory-intensive. We urge that the availability of large,
representative datasets in the military domain is a prerequisite to further
evaluate risks of poisoning attacks and opportunities patch detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低剂量CT(LDCT)虽然减少辐射暴露，但会导致噪声增加和图像质量下降。传统去噪方法在保持图像质量方面存在不足，需要新的解决方案

Method: 使用基于强化学习的方法，采用先进的后验策略优化(PPO)算法，通过编码器-解码器架构实时优化去噪策略，基于图像质量反馈进行训练

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优异：PSNR达41.87，SSIM达0.9814，RMSE为0.00236；在COVID-19 LDCT数据集上分类准确率达到94%，比无RL去噪方法提升4%

Conclusion: 该方法为更安全、更准确的LDCT成像提供了有前景的解决方案，显著提升了图像质量和下游任务的性能

Abstract: Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) is critical for minimizing radiation
exposure, but it often leads to increased noise and reduced image quality.
Traditional denoising methods, such as iterative optimization or supervised
learning, often fail to preserve image quality. To address these challenges, we
introduce PPORLD-EDNetLDCT, a reinforcement learning-based (RL) approach with
Encoder-Decoder for LDCT. Our method utilizes a dynamic RL-based approach in
which an advanced posterior policy optimization (PPO) algorithm is used to
optimize denoising policies in real time, based on image quality feedback,
trained via a custom gym environment. The experimental results on the low dose
CT image and projection dataset demonstrate that the proposed PPORLD-EDNetLDCT
model outperforms traditional denoising techniques and other DL-based methods,
achieving a peak signal-to-noise ratio of 41.87, a structural similarity index
measure of 0.9814 and a root mean squared error of 0.00236. Moreover, in
NIH-AAPM-Mayo Clinic Low Dose CT Challenge dataset our method achived a PSNR of
41.52, SSIM of 0.9723 and RMSE of 0.0051. Furthermore, we validated the quality
of denoising using a classification task in the COVID-19 LDCT dataset, where
the images processed by our method improved the classification accuracy to
94\%, achieving 4\% higher accuracy compared to denoising without RL-based
denoising. This method offers a promising solution for safer and more accurate
LDCT imaging.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly improved
natural language understanding and generation, enhancing Human-Computer
Interaction (HCI). However, LLMs are limited to unimodal text processing and
lack the ability to interpret emotional cues from non-verbal signals, hindering
more immersive and empathetic interactions. This work explores integrating
multimodal sentiment perception into LLMs to create emotion-aware agents. We
propose \ours, an AI-based virtual companion that captures multimodal sentiment
cues, enabling emotionally aligned and animated HCI. \ours introduces a
Multimodal Sentiment Perception Network (MSPN) using a cross-modal fusion
transformer and supervised contrastive learning to provide emotional cues.
Additionally, we develop an emotion-aware prompt engineering strategy for
generating empathetic responses and integrate a Text-to-Speech (TTS) system and
animated avatar module for expressive interactions. \ours provides a framework
for emotion-aware agents with applications in companion robotics, social care,
mental health, and human-centered AI.

Conclusion: RTGMFF通过结合自动文本生成和多模态特征融合，有效解决了fMRI数据分析中的挑战，为脑部疾病诊断提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a powerful tool for probing
brain function, yet reliable clinical diagnosis is hampered by low
signal-to-noise ratios, inter-subject variability, and the limited frequency
awareness of prevailing CNN- and Transformer-based models. Moreover, most fMRI
datasets lack textual annotations that could contextualize regional activation
and connectivity patterns. We introduce RTGMFF, a framework that unifies
automatic ROI-level text generation with multimodal feature fusion for
brain-disorder diagnosis. RTGMFF consists of three components: (i) ROI-driven
fMRI text generation deterministically condenses each subject's activation,
connectivity, age, and sex into reproducible text tokens; (ii) Hybrid
frequency-spatial encoder fuses a hierarchical wavelet-mamba branch with a
cross-scale Transformer encoder to capture frequency-domain structure alongside
long-range spatial dependencies; and (iii) Adaptive semantic alignment module
embeds the ROI token sequence and visual features in a shared space, using a
regularized cosine-similarity loss to narrow the modality gap. Extensive
experiments on the ADHD-200 and ABIDE benchmarks show that RTGMFF surpasses
current methods in diagnostic accuracy, achieving notable gains in sensitivity,
specificity, and area under the ROC curve. Code is available at

Abstract: Synthetic tumors in medical images offer controllable characteristics that
facilitate the training of machine learning models, leading to an improved
segmentation performance. However, the existing methods of tumor synthesis
yield suboptimal performances when tumor occupies a large spatial volume, such
as breast tumor segmentation in MRI with a large field-of-view (FOV), while
commonly used tumor generation methods are based on small patches. In this
paper, we propose a 3D medical diffusion model, called SynBT, to generate
high-quality breast tumor (BT) in contrast-enhanced MRI images. The proposed
model consists of a patch-to-volume autoencoder, which is able to compress the
high-resolution MRIs into compact latent space, while preserving the resolution
of volumes with large FOV. Using the obtained latent space feature vector, a
mask-conditioned diffusion model is used to synthesize breast tumors within
selected regions of breast tissue, resulting in realistic tumor appearances. We
evaluated the proposed method for a tumor segmentation task, which demonstrated
the proposed high-quality tumor synthesis method can facilitate the common
segmentation models with performance improvement of 2-3% Dice Score on a large
public dataset, and therefore provides benefits for tumor segmentation in MRI
images.

*Qihang Zhou,Shibo He,Jiangtao Yan,Wenchao Meng,Jiming Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过结合Point咄Pixel级别信息，将CLIP的2D异常检测能力转移到3D领域，提出PointAD+统一框架来检测咄分割看不见对象的3D异常


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将CLIP在2D图像上的健壮异常检测能力扩展到3D领域，解决在未见过的多样化类别对象上进行3D异常检测的挑战

Method: 首先设计PointAD（隐式3D表示）利用点-像素对应关系，然后提出PointAD+（显式3D表示）通过G-aggregation涵盖几何信息，采用层次表征学习咄跨层次对比对齐，统合渲染层咄几何层的异常语义

Result: 大量实验证明PointAD+在看不见对象的零样本学习3D异常检测中表现优异，能够处理高度多样化的类别语义，实现对3D异常的全面理解

Conclusion: PointAD+通过结合隐式咄显式3D表示方法，成功将CLIP的2D异常检测能力转移到3D领域，为处理未见对象的3D异常检测提供了有效的统一框架

Abstract: In this paper, we aim to transfer CLIP's robust 2D generalization
capabilities to identify 3D anomalies across unseen objects of highly diverse
class semantics. To this end, we propose a unified framework to comprehensively
detect and segment 3D anomalies by leveraging both point- and pixel-level
information. We first design PointAD, which leverages point-pixel
correspondence to represent 3D anomalies through their associated rendering
pixel representations. This approach is referred to as implicit 3D
representation, as it focuses solely on rendering pixel anomalies but neglects
the inherent spatial relationships within point clouds. Then, we propose
PointAD+ to further broaden the interpretation of 3D anomalies by introducing
explicit 3D representation, emphasizing spatial abnormality to uncover abnormal
spatial relationships. Hence, we propose G-aggregation to involve geometry
information to enable the aggregated point representations spatially aware. To
simultaneously capture rendering and spatial abnormality, PointAD+ proposes
hierarchical representation learning, incorporating implicit and explicit
anomaly semantics into hierarchical text prompts: rendering prompts for the
rendering layer and geometry prompts for the geometry layer. A cross-hierarchy
contrastive alignment is further introduced to promote the interaction between
the rendering and geometry layers, facilitating mutual anomaly learning.
Finally, PointAD+ integrates anomaly semantics from both layers to capture the
generalized anomaly semantics. During the test, PointAD+ can integrate RGB
information in a plug-and-play manner and further improve its detection
performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of PointAD+ in
ZS 3D anomaly detection across unseen objects with highly diverse class
semantics, achieving a holistic understanding of abnormality.

*Linyu Ou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了长链式思维数据对轻量级多模态语言模型推理能力的提升作用，发现先通过长CoT数据进行监督微调，再进行强化学习，可有效提升轻量级MLLM的推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然带可验证奖励的强化学习已提升大规模语言模型的推理能力，但对参数少于70亿的轻量级多模态语言模型的效果仍不明确，需要探索如何有效提升这类模型的推理能力。

Method: 采用长链式思维(long CoT)数据进行监督微调(SFT)，然后在此基础上进行强化学习(RL)阶段。研究长CoT数据在提升轻量级MLLM推理能力中的作用。

Result: 监督微调使用长CoT数据显著提升了MLLM的推理能力；在SFT阶段之后，通过强化学习还可以获得额外的性能提升。

Conclusion: 使用长CoT数据进行监督微调是发展轻量级多模态语言模型推理能力的关键前提条件，为后续强化学习基础排搬。

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards has enhanced the
reasoning of large-scale language models (LLMs), its efficacy for lightweight
multimodal language models (MLLMs) with fewer than seven billion parameters
remains underexplored. This paper investigates the role of long
Chain-of-Thought (long CoT) data in enhancing the reasoning abilities of such
MLLMs. Our findings demonstrate that Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with long CoT
data significantly improves MLLM reasoning. Furthermore, we observe that after
this initial SFT phase, MLLMs can achieve additional performance gains through
a subsequent RL stage. We conclude that a SFT stage with long CoT data is a
critical prerequisite for developing the reasoning capabilities of lightweight
MLLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 星形细胞的异常形态和密度是许多神经系统疾病的标志，但其复杂的分枝结构和染色变异性使得自动化检测极其困难。

Method: 提出混合CNN-Transformer检测器：CNN提取局部特征，Transformer提供全局上下文理解；热力图导向查询机制生成空间基础锚点；轻量Transformer模块提高密集聚集区别能力。

Result: 在ALDH1L1和GFAP染色的星形细胞数据集上，模型表现超过Faster R-CNN、YOLOv11和DETR，实现更高敏感性和更少假阻性，FROC分析确认了这一结果。

Conclusion: 混合CNN-Transformer械架在星形细胞检测中展现出强大潜力，为进阶计算病理学工具的发展奠定了基础。

Abstract: Astrocytes are critical glial cells whose altered morphology and density are
hallmarks of many neurological disorders. However, their intricate branching
and stain dependent variability make automated detection of histological images
a highly challenging task. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid CNN
Transformer detector that combines local feature extraction with global
contextual reasoning. A heatmap guided query mechanism generates spatially
grounded anchors for small and faint astrocytes, while a lightweight
Transformer module improves discrimination in dense clusters. Evaluated on
ALDH1L1 and GFAP stained astrocyte datasets, the model consistently
outperformed Faster R-CNN, YOLOv11 and DETR, achieving higher sensitivity with
fewer false positives, as confirmed by FROC analysis. These results highlight
the potential of hybrid CNN Transformer architectures for robust astrocyte
detection and provide a foundation for advanced computational pathology tools.

TL;DR: InfraDiffusion是一个零样本框架，通过虚拟相机将砖石点云转换为深度图，并使用DDNM进行恢复，无需特定任务训练即可显著提升砖块级分割效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在低光照环境下获取高分辨率RGB图像不切实际，而点云虽然对暗光环境鲁棒，但通常是非结构化、稀疏且有噪声的，限制了细粒度分割能力

Method: 将砖石点云通过虚拟相机投影为深度图，采用去噪扩散零空间模型(DDNM)进行恢复，无需特定任务训练即可增强深度图的视觉清晰度和几何一致性

Result: 在砖石桥梁和隧道点云数据集上的实验显示，使用Segment Anything Model(SAM)进行砖块级分割时取得了显著改进

Conclusion: 该方法展示了在砖石资产自动化检测方面的潜力，特别是在低光照环境下提供了一种有效的点云增强和分割解决方案

Abstract: Point clouds are widely used for infrastructure monitoring by providing
geometric information, where segmentation is required for downstream tasks such
as defect detection. Existing research has automated semantic segmentation of
structural components, while brick-level segmentation (identifying defects such
as spalling and mortar loss) has been primarily conducted from RGB images.
However, acquiring high-resolution images is impractical in low-light
environments like masonry tunnels. Point clouds, though robust to dim lighting,
are typically unstructured, sparse, and noisy, limiting fine-grained
segmentation. We present InfraDiffusion, a zero-shot framework that projects
masonry point clouds into depth maps using virtual cameras and restores them by
adapting the Denoising Diffusion Null-space Model (DDNM). Without task-specific
training, InfraDiffusion enhances visual clarity and geometric consistency of
depth maps. Experiments on masonry bridge and tunnel point cloud datasets show
significant improvements in brick-level segmentation using the Segment Anything
Model (SAM), underscoring its potential for automated inspection of masonry
assets. Our code and data is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法难以同时表征全局依赖和局部一致性，无法兼顾长程交互和边界细节的保持

Method: 使用Transformer捕获全局依赖，引入内容自适应图神经网络增强局部关系，集成多传播阶次动态学习图结构，采用图残差机制保持全局信息和稳定训练

Result: 实验结果表明该方法优于最先进的方法

Conclusion: T-CAGU框架有效解决了高光谱解混中全局和局部特征同时保持的难题，具有鲁棒性和优越性能

Abstract: Hyperspectral unmixing (HU) targets to decompose each mixed pixel in remote
sensing images into a set of endmembers and their corresponding abundances.
Despite significant progress in this field using deep learning, most methods
fail to simultaneously characterize global dependencies and local consistency,
making it difficult to preserve both long-range interactions and boundary
details. This letter proposes a novel transformer-guided content-adaptive graph
unmixing framework (T-CAGU), which overcomes these challenges by employing a
transformer to capture global dependencies and introducing a content-adaptive
graph neural network to enhance local relationships. Unlike previous work,
T-CAGU integrates multiple propagation orders to dynamically learn the graph
structure, ensuring robustness against noise. Furthermore, T-CAGU leverages a
graph residual mechanism to preserve global information and stabilize training.
Experimental results demonstrate its superiority over the state-of-the-art
methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/xianchaoxiu/T-CAGU.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers在图像分类中表现优异但计算成本高昂，需要在不牺牲精度的情况下降低大型ViT模型的推理成本

Method: 提出TinyDrop框架：使用轻量级视觉模型在推理时估计token重要性，指导大型ViT模型选择性丢弃低重要性token，无需训练和架构修改

Result: 在标准图像分类基准测试中，FLOPs减少高达80%，精度下降极小，具有良好的泛化能力

Conclusion: TinyDrop为高效ViT分类提供了实用的解决方案，具有即插即用、兼容多种ViT架构的优点

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) achieve strong performance in image classification
but incur high computational costs from processing all image tokens. To reduce
inference costs in large ViTs without compromising accuracy, we propose
TinyDrop, a training-free token dropping framework guided by a lightweight
vision model. The guidance model estimates the importance of tokens while
performing inference, thereby selectively discarding low-importance tokens if
large vit models need to perform attention calculations. The framework operates
plug-and-play, requires no architectural modifications, and is compatible with
diverse ViT architectures. Evaluations on standard image classification
benchmarks demonstrate that our framework reduces FLOPs by up to 80% for ViTs
with minimal accuracy degradation, highlighting its generalization capability
and practical utility for efficient ViT-based classification.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了D-GPTScore评价方法和CC-AlignBench标准数据集，用于更准确地评估多概念自定制生成的质量，并与人类偏好更一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的概念自定制评估方法存在问题：评估范围过于窄阑或过于广泛，导致与人类偏好不一致。多概念评估比单概念更加困难，需要考虑概念之间的交互作用。

Method: 提出Decomposed GPT Score (D-GPTScore)，将评估标准分解为更细层面的方面，并使用多模态大语言模型(MLLM)进行方面级别的评估。同时发布了Human Preference-Aligned Concept Customization Benchmark (CC-AlignBench)标准数据集。

Result: 在CC-AlignBench标准数据集上，该方法显著超过现有方法，与人类偏好展现出更高的相关性。

Conclusion: 这项工作为概念自定制评估建立了新标准，并指出了未来研究的关键挑战。

Abstract: Evaluating concept customization is challenging, as it requires a
comprehensive assessment of fidelity to generative prompts and concept images.
Moreover, evaluating multiple concepts is considerably more difficult than
evaluating a single concept, as it demands detailed assessment not only for
each individual concept but also for the interactions among concepts. While
humans can intuitively assess generated images, existing metrics often provide
either overly narrow or overly generalized evaluations, resulting in
misalignment with human preference. To address this, we propose Decomposed GPT
Score (D-GPTScore), a novel human-aligned evaluation method that decomposes
evaluation criteria into finer aspects and incorporates aspect-wise assessments
using Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). Additionally, we release Human
Preference-Aligned Concept Customization Benchmark (CC-AlignBench), a benchmark
dataset containing both single- and multi-concept tasks, enabling stage-wise
evaluation across a wide difficulty range -- from individual actions to
multi-person interactions. Our method significantly outperforms existing
approaches on this benchmark, exhibiting higher correlation with human
preferences. This work establishes a new standard for evaluating concept
customization and highlights key challenges for future research. The benchmark

Method: 提出可扩展的松耦合多模态框架，整合CNV、临床记录和组织病理图像。引入双重WSI表征（图像基础和图论基础），并提出新的多模态融合策略。框架设计为可轻松添加其他模态。

Result: 结果显示，将双重WSI表征与CNV和临床健康记录结合，以及采用新的融合策略，在乳腾癌分子分型任务上超过了最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅在乳腾癌分子分型中表现优异，还具有良好的扩展性，可以应用于其他癌症类型，为多模态医疗应用提供了灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Healthcare applications are inherently multimodal, benefiting greatly from
the integration of diverse data sources. However, the modalities available in
clinical settings can vary across different locations and patients. A key area
that stands to gain from multimodal integration is breast cancer molecular
subtyping, an important clinical task that can facilitate personalized
treatment and improve patient prognosis. In this work, we propose a scalable
and loosely-coupled multimodal framework that seamlessly integrates data from
various modalities, including copy number variation (CNV), clinical records,
and histopathology images, to enhance breast cancer subtyping. While our
primary focus is on breast cancer, our framework is designed to easily
accommodate additional modalities, offering the flexibility to scale up or down
with minimal overhead without requiring re-training of existing modalities,
making it applicable to other types of cancers as well. We introduce a
dual-based representation for whole slide images (WSIs), combining traditional
image-based and graph-based WSI representations. This novel dual approach
results in significant performance improvements. Moreover, we present a new
multimodal fusion strategy, demonstrating its ability to enhance performance
across a range of multimodal conditions. Our comprehensive results show that
integrating our dual-based WSI representation with CNV and clinical health
records, along with our pipeline and fusion strategy, outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in breast cancer subtyping.

Motivation: 现有的密集视频描述方法在处理长视频时遇到计算复杂度和内存限制问题，且需要整个视频作为输入才能输出结果，无法进行在线处理。

Method: 提出了带有传输状态的状态空间模型(State-Space Models with Transfer State)，结合了SSMs的长序列和递归性质，解决了SSMs在很长上下文中无法保持状态的主要限制。

Result: 该方法适合以流式方式进行实时描述生成，不需要等待整个视频处理完成。在密集视频描述任务中，能够良好地适应不同视频长度，并使用7倍更少的FLOPs。

Conclusion: 该研究通过时间缩放SSMs模型，提出了一种更高效的密集视频描述方案，解决了长视频处理的计算挑战，并支持在线流式处理，具有重要的实践价值。

Abstract: Dense video captioning is a challenging video understanding task which aims
to simultaneously segment the video into a sequence of meaningful consecutive
events and to generate detailed captions to accurately describe each event.
Existing methods often encounter difficulties when working with the long videos
associated with dense video captioning, due to the computational complexity and
memory limitations. Furthermore, traditional approaches require the entire
video as input, in order to produce an answer, which precludes online
processing of the video. We address these challenges by time-scaling
State-Space Models (SSMs) to even longer sequences than before. Our approach,
State-Space Models with Transfer State, combines both the long-sequence and
recurrent properties of SSMs and addresses the main limitation of SSMs which
are otherwise not able to sustain their state for very long contexts,
effectively scaling SSMs further in time. The proposed model is particularly
suitable for generating captions on-the-fly, in an online or streaming manner,
without having to wait for the full video to be processed, which is more
beneficial in practice. When applied to dense video captioning, our approach
scales well with video lengths and uses 7x fewer FLOPs.

Motivation: 解决从低信器比EEG信号中解码视觉神经表征的挑战，通过引入文本模态来增强EEG信号与视觉内容之间的语义对应关系。

Method: 提出了一个多模态框架，包括：1)使用文本提供显式语义标签；2)设计适配器模块来利用预训练的视觉和文本表征；3)模态一致性动态平衡(MCDB)策略；4)随机扰动正则化(SPR)项来提高模型的泛化能力。

Result: 在ThingsEEG数据集上，方法在Top-1和Top-5准确率指标上超越了之前的最好方法，分别提高了2.0%和4.7%。

Conclusion: 该框架通过多模态数据的有效整合和创新的正则化技术，成功地从低信器比EEG信号中解码了视觉神经表征，为神经科学和计算机视觉领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: In this work, we propose an innovative framework that integrates EEG, image,
and text data, aiming to decode visual neural representations from low
signal-to-noise ratio EEG signals. Specifically, we introduce text modality to
enhance the semantic correspondence between EEG signals and visual content.
With the explicit semantic labels provided by text, image and EEG features of
the same category can be more closely aligned with the corresponding text
representations in a shared multimodal space. To fully utilize pre-trained
visual and textual representations, we propose an adapter module that
alleviates the instability of high-dimensional representation while
facilitating the alignment and fusion of cross-modal features. Additionally, to
alleviate the imbalance in multimodal feature contributions introduced by the
textual representations, we propose a Modal Consistency Dynamic Balance (MCDB)
strategy that dynamically adjusts the contribution weights of each modality. We
further propose a stochastic perturbation regularization (SPR) term to enhance
the generalization ability of semantic perturbation-based models by introducing
dynamic Gaussian noise in the modality optimization process. The evaluation
results on the ThingsEEG dataset show that our method surpasses previous
state-of-the-art methods in both Top-1 and Top-5 accuracy metrics, improving by
2.0\% and 4.7\% respectively.

Result: 在RDD2022道路缺陷检测基准测试中超越最先进方法，参数量仅为竞争基线的20%以下

Conclusion: JTGD方法通过联合训练生成更难的训练样本，提高了检测性能，同时大幅减少参数量，非常适合在实际边缘设备上部署

Abstract: Road defect detection is important for road authorities to reduce the vehicle
damage caused by road defects. Considering the practical scenarios where the
defect detectors are typically deployed on edge devices with limited memory and
computational resource, we aim at performing road defect detection without
using ensemble-based methods or test-time augmentation (TTA). To this end, we
propose to Jointly Train the image Generator and Detector for road defect
detection (dubbed as JTGD). We design the dual discriminators for the
generative model to enforce both the synthesized defect patches and overall
images to look plausible. The synthesized image quality is improved by our
proposed CLIP-based Fr\'echet Inception Distance loss. The generative model in
JTGD is trained jointly with the detector to encourage the generative model to
synthesize harder examples for the detector. Since harder synthesized images of
better quality caused by the aforesaid design are used in the data
augmentation, JTGD outperforms the state-of-the-art method in the RDD2022 road
defect detection benchmark across various countries under the condition of no
ensemble and TTA. JTGD only uses less than 20% of the number of parameters
compared with the competing baseline, which makes it more suitable for
deployment on edge devices in practice.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel parameter-efficient adaptation method for
No- Reference Image Quality Assessment (NR-IQA) using visual prompts optimized
in pixel-space. Unlike full fine-tuning of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs), our approach trains only 600K parameters at most (< 0.01% of the base
model), while keeping the underlying model fully frozen. During inference,
these visual prompts are combined with images via addition and processed by
mPLUG-Owl2 with the textual query "Rate the technical quality of the image."
Evaluations across distortion types (synthetic, realistic, AI-generated) on
KADID- 10k, KonIQ-10k, and AGIQA-3k demonstrate competitive performance against
full finetuned methods and specialized NR-IQA models, achieving 0.93 SRCC on
KADID-10k. To our knowledge, this is the first work to leverage pixel-space
visual prompts for NR-IQA, enabling efficient MLLM adaptation for low-level

Abstract: We introduce OneCAT, a unified multimodal model that seamlessly integrates
understanding, generation, and editing within a novel, pure decoder-only
transformer architecture. Our framework uniquely eliminates the need for
external components such as Vision Transformers (ViT) or vision tokenizer
during inference, leading to significant efficiency gains, especially for
high-resolution inputs. This is achieved through a modality-specific
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) structure trained with a single autoregressive (AR)
objective, which also natively supports dynamic resolutions. Furthermore, we
pioneer a multi-scale visual autoregressive mechanism within the Large Language
Model (LLM) that drastically reduces decoding steps compared to diffusion-based
methods while maintaining state-of-the-art performance. Our findings
demonstrate the powerful potential of pure autoregressive modeling as a
sufficient and elegant foundation for unified multimodal intelligence. As a
result, OneCAT sets a new performance standard, outperforming existing
open-source unified multimodal models across benchmarks for multimodal
generation, editing, and understanding.

Abstract: Benchmarking multi-object tracking and object detection model performance is
an essential step in machine learning model development, as it allows
researchers to evaluate model detection and tracker performance on
human-generated 'test' data, facilitating consistent comparisons between models
and trackers and aiding performance optimization. In this study, a novel
benchmark video dataset was developed and used to assess the performance of
several Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute object detection models and a
FathomNet single-class object detection model together with several trackers.
The dataset consists of four video sequences representing midwater and benthic
deep-sea habitats. Performance was evaluated using Higher Order Tracking
Accuracy, a metric that balances detection, localization, and association
accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first publicly available
benchmark for multi-object tracking in deep-sea video footage. We provide the
benchmark data, a clearly documented workflow for generating additional
benchmark videos, as well as example Python notebooks for computing metrics.

Result: 实验评估显示，使用Strefer生成数据训练的模型在需要空间和时间消歧的任务上优于基线模型，并展现出增强的时空感知推理能力。

Conclusion: Strefer为感知基础的指令调优视频大语言模型建立了新基础，无需使用专有模型、昂贵的人工注释或大量新视频注释，即可提升模型的时空参考理解能力。

Abstract: Next-generation AI companions must go beyond general video understanding to
resolve spatial and temporal references in dynamic, real-world environments.
Existing Video Large Language Models (Video LLMs), while capable of
coarse-level comprehension, struggle with fine-grained, spatiotemporal
reasoning, especially when user queries rely on time-based event references for
temporal anchoring, or gestural cues for spatial anchoring to clarify object
references and positions. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce Strefer, a
synthetic instruction data generation framework designed to equip Video LLMs
with spatiotemporal referring and reasoning capabilities. Strefer produces
diverse instruction-tuning data using a data engine that pseudo-annotates
temporally dense, fine-grained video metadata, capturing rich spatial and
temporal information in a structured manner, including subjects, objects, their
locations as masklets, and their action descriptions and timelines. Our
approach enhances the ability of Video LLMs to interpret spatial and temporal
references, fostering more versatile, space-time-aware reasoning essential for
real-world AI companions. Without using proprietary models, costly human
annotation, or the need to annotate large volumes of new videos, experimental
evaluations show that models trained with data produced by Strefer outperform
baselines on tasks requiring spatial and temporal disambiguation. Additionally,
these models exhibit enhanced space-time-aware reasoning, establishing a new
foundation for perceptually grounded, instruction-tuned Video LLMs.

Abstract: This paper introduces a comprehensive database for research and investigation
on the effects of inheritance on handwriting. A database has been created that
can be used to answer questions such as: Is there a genetic component to
handwriting? Is handwriting inherited? Do family relationships affect
handwriting? Varieties of samples of handwritten components such as: digits,
letters, shapes and free paragraphs of 210 families including (grandparents,
parents, uncles, aunts, siblings, cousins, nephews and nieces) have been
collected using specially designed forms, and family relationships of all
writers are captured. To the best of our knowledge, no such database is
presently available. Based on comparisons and investigation of features of
handwritings of family members, similarities among their features and writing
styles are detected. Our database is freely available to the pattern
recognition community and hope it will pave the way for investigations on the
effects of inheritance and family relationships on handwritings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像生成基准测试在评估组合和推理能力方面存在局限性，无法全面评估模型在这两个核心能力上的表现，特别是在处理复杂高密度场景和多步推理方面

Method: 构建了一个12维评估分类法，围绕场景图元素（实例、属性、关系）构建组合能力评估，围绕哲学推理框架（演绎、归纳、溯因）构建推理能力评估，每个提示都配有检查清单来独立评估每个元素

Result: 对27个当前T2I模型的实验表明，它们在复杂高密度场景中的组合能力仍然有限，而推理能力更是严重滞后，所有模型都难以从提示中推断隐含元素

Conclusion: T2I-CoReBench提供了一个全面复杂的基准测试，揭示了当前T2I模型在组合和推理能力方面的局限性，特别是在处理复杂场景和隐含推理方面需要显著改进

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generation aims to synthesize images from textual
prompts, which jointly specify what must be shown and imply what can be
inferred, thereby corresponding to two core capabilities: composition and
reasoning. However, with the emerging advances of T2I models in reasoning
beyond composition, existing benchmarks reveal clear limitations in providing
comprehensive evaluations across and within these capabilities. Meanwhile,
these advances also enable models to handle more complex prompts, whereas
current benchmarks remain limited to low scene density and simplified
one-to-one reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose T2I-CoReBench, a
comprehensive and complex benchmark that evaluates both composition and
reasoning capabilities of T2I models. To ensure comprehensiveness, we structure
composition around scene graph elements (instance, attribute, and relation) and
reasoning around the philosophical framework of inference (deductive,
inductive, and abductive), formulating a 12-dimensional evaluation taxonomy. To
increase complexity, driven by the inherent complexities of real-world
scenarios, we curate each prompt with high compositional density for
composition and multi-step inference for reasoning. We also pair each prompt
with a checklist that specifies individual yes/no questions to assess each
intended element independently to facilitate fine-grained and reliable
evaluation. In statistics, our benchmark comprises 1,080 challenging prompts
and around 13,500 checklist questions. Experiments across 27 current T2I models
reveal that their composition capability still remains limited in complex
high-density scenarios, while the reasoning capability lags even further behind
as a critical bottleneck, with all models struggling to infer implicit elements
from prompts. Our project page: https://t2i-corebench.github.io/.

<details>

Motivation: 四足机器人在复杂地形上具有越野优势，但传统控制方法面临滑移、篮击等挑战，建模复杂很快变得不实用

Method: 通过强化学习进行试错学习，实现优化控制，发展了一种通用型算法

Result: 学习到的策略与最优专家策略相当，但训练时仅需要25%的代理数量，显著提高了训练效率

Conclusion: 强化学习提供了解决四足机器人复杂运动控制的有效途径，通用型算法在保持性能的同时显著降低了训练成本

Abstract: Climbing, crouching, bridging gaps, and walking up stairs are just a few of
the advantages that quadruped robots have over wheeled robots, making them more
suitable for navigating rough and unstructured terrain. However, executing such
manoeuvres requires precise temporal coordination and complex agent-environment
interactions. Moreover, legged locomotion is inherently more prone to slippage
and tripping, and the classical approach of modeling such cases to design a
robust controller thus quickly becomes impractical. In contrast, reinforcement
learning offers a compelling solution by enabling optimal control through trial
and error. We present a generalist reinforcement learning algorithm for
quadrupedal agents in dynamic motion scenarios. The learned policy rivals
state-of-the-art specialist policies trained using a mixture of experts
approach, while using only 25% as many agents during training. Our experiments
also highlight the key components of the generalist locomotion policy and the
primary factors contributing to its success.

Motivation: 研究情感对齐作为共情沟通的前提条件，在人机交互中的影响，包括对机器人说服力、用户沟通风格和心理状态归因的作用

Method: 使用NAO机器人进行实验，对42名参与者进行两种条件对比：中性沟通条件和情感适配条件（机器人根据用户情感调整回应）

Result: 情感对齐对用户沟通风格和说服效果没有影响，但显著影响用户对机器人心理状态的归因和共情感知

Conclusion: 情感对齐在人机交互中的作用有限，虽然能提升机器人的心理性赋能，但并不能改善其说服效果或影响用户沟通方式

Abstract: The paper presents an experiment on the effects of adaptive emotional
alignment between agents, considered a prerequisite for empathic communication,
in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI). Using the NAO robot, we investigate the
impact of an emotionally aligned, empathic, dialogue on these aspects: (i) the
robot's persuasive effectiveness, (ii) the user's communication style, and
(iii) the attribution of mental states and empathy to the robot. In an
experiment with 42 participants, two conditions were compared: one with neutral
communication and another where the robot provided responses adapted to the
emotions expressed by the users. The results show that emotional alignment does
not influence users' communication styles or have a persuasive effect. However,
it significantly influences attribution of mental states to the robot and its
perceived empathy

Abstract: Studying tissue samples obtained during autopsies is the gold standard when
diagnosing the cause of death and for understanding disease pathophysiology.
Recently, the interest in post mortem minimally invasive biopsies has grown
which is a less destructive approach in comparison to an open autopsy and
reduces the risk of infection. While manual biopsies under ultrasound guidance
are more widely performed, robotic post mortem biopsies have been recently
proposed. This approach can further reduce the risk of infection for
physicians. However, planning of the procedure and control of the robot need to
be efficient and usable. We explore a virtual reality setup with a digital twin
to realize fully remote planning and control of robotic post mortem biopsies.
The setup is evaluated with forensic pathologists in a usability study for
three interaction methods. Furthermore, we evaluate clinical feasibility and
evaluate the system with three human cadavers. Overall, 132 needle insertions
were performed with an off-axis needle placement error of 5.30+-3.25 mm. Tissue
samples were successfully biopsied and histopathologically verified. Users
reported a very intuitive needle placement approach, indicating that the system
is a promising, precise, and low-risk alternative to conventional approaches.

Abstract: Autonomously controlling quadrotors in large-scale subterranean environments
is applicable to many areas such as environmental surveying, mining operations,
and search and rescue. Learning-based controllers represent an appealing
approach to autonomy, but are known to not generalize well to
`out-of-distribution' environments not encountered during training. In this
work, we train a normalizing flow-based prior over the environment, which
provides a measure of how far out-of-distribution the quadrotor is at any given
time. We use this measure as a runtime monitor, allowing us to switch between a
learning-based controller and a safe controller when we are sufficiently
out-of-distribution. Our methods are benchmarked on a point-to-point navigation
task in a simulated 3D cave environment based on real-world point cloud data
from the DARPA Subterranean Challenge Final Event Dataset. Our experimental
results show that our combined controller simultaneously possesses the liveness
of the learning-based controller (completing the task quickly) and the safety
of the safety controller (avoiding collision).

Abstract: The small scale of urban farms and the commercial availability of low-cost
robots (such as the FarmBot) that automate simple tending tasks enable an
accessible platform for plant phenotyping. We have used a FarmBot with a custom
camera end-effector to estimate strawberry plant flower pose (for robotic
pollination) from acquired 3D point cloud models. We describe a novel algorithm
that translates individual occupancy grids along orthogonal axes of a point
cloud to obtain 2D images corresponding to the six viewpoints. For each image,
2D object detection models for flowers are used to identify 2D bounding boxes
which can be converted into the 3D space to extract flower point clouds. Pose
estimation is performed by fitting three shapes (superellipsoids, paraboloids
and planes) to the flower point clouds and compared with manually labeled
ground truth. Our method successfully finds approximately 80% of flowers
scanned using our customized FarmBot platform and has a mean flower pose error
of 7.7 degrees, which is sufficient for robotic pollination and rivals previous
results. All code will be made available at

Abstract: The quasi-repetitive nature of construction work and the resulting lack of
generalizability in programming construction robots presents persistent
challenges to the broad adoption of robots in the construction industry. Robots
cannot achieve generalist capabilities as skills learnt from one domain cannot
readily transfer to another work domain or be directly used to perform a
different set of tasks. Human workers have to arduously reprogram their
scene-understanding, path-planning, and manipulation components to enable the
robots to perform alternate work tasks. The methods presented in this paper
resolve a significant proportion of such reprogramming workload by proposing a
generalizable learning architecture that directly teaches robots versatile
task-performance skills through crowdsourced online natural language
instructions. A Large Language Model (LLM), a standardized and modularized
hierarchical modeling approach, and Building Information Modeling-Robot sematic
data pipeline are developed to address the multi-task skill transfer problem.
The proposed skill standardization scheme and LLM-based hierarchical skill
learning framework were tested with a long-horizon drywall installation
experiment using a full-scale industrial robotic manipulator. The resulting
robot task learning scheme achieves multi-task reprogramming with minimal
effort and high quality.

Conclusion: 该特征感知机制能够有效解决动态SLAM中特征不足的问题，在降低计算复杂度的同时提升了系统性能

Abstract: Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) plays a crucial role in
autonomous systems. Traditional SLAM methods, based on static environment
assumptions, struggle to handle complex dynamic environments. Recent dynamic
SLAM systems employ geometric constraints and deep learning to remove dynamic
features, yet this creates a new challenge: insufficient remaining point
features for subsequent SLAM processes. Existing solutions address this by
continuously introducing additional line and plane features to supplement point
features, achieving robust tracking and pose estimation. However, current
methods continuously introduce additional features regardless of necessity,
causing two problems: unnecessary computational overhead and potential
performance degradation from accumulated low-quality additional features and
noise. To address these issues, this paper proposes a feature-aware mechanism
that evaluates whether current features are adequate to determine if line
feature support should be activated. This decision mechanism enables the system
to introduce line features only when necessary, significantly reducing
computational complexity of additional features while minimizing the
introduction of low-quality features and noise. In subsequent processing, the
introduced line features assist in obtaining better initial camera poses
through tracking, local mapping, and loop closure, but are excluded from global
optimization to avoid potential negative impacts from low-quality additional
features in long-term process. Extensive experiments on TUM datasets
demonstrate substantial improvements in both ATE and RPE metrics compared to
ORB-SLAM3 baseline and superior performance over other dynamic SLAM and
multi-feature methods.

Conclusion: DUViN方法通过知识迁移策略成功实现了水下视觉导航，为解决水下导航数据稀缺和领域适应问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Autonomous underwater navigation remains a challenging problem due to limited
sensing capabilities and the difficulty of constructing accurate maps in
underwater environments. In this paper, we propose a Diffusion-based Underwater
Visual Navigation policy via knowledge-transferred depth features, named DUViN,
which enables vision-based end-to-end 4-DoF motion control for underwater
vehicles in unknown environments. DUViN guides the vehicle to avoid obstacles
and maintain a safe and perception awareness altitude relative to the terrain
without relying on pre-built maps. To address the difficulty of collecting
large-scale underwater navigation datasets, we propose a method that ensures
robust generalization under domain shifts from in-air to underwater
environments by leveraging depth features and introducing a novel model
transfer strategy. Specifically, our training framework consists of two phases:
we first train the diffusion-based visual navigation policy on in-air datasets
using a pre-trained depth feature extractor. Secondly, we retrain the extractor
on an underwater depth estimation task and integrate the adapted extractor into
the trained navigation policy from the first step. Experiments in both
simulated and real-world underwater environments demonstrate the effectiveness
and generalization of our approach. The experimental videos are available at

Abstract: In recent years, wheeled bipedal robots have gained increasing attention due
to their advantages in mobility, such as high-speed locomotion on flat terrain.
However, their performance on complex environments (e.g., staircases) remains
inferior to that of traditional legged robots. To overcome this limitation, we
propose a general contact-triggered blind climbing (CTBC) framework for wheeled
bipedal robots. Upon detecting wheel-obstacle contact, the robot triggers a
leg-lifting motion to overcome the obstacle. By leveraging a strongly-guided
feedforward trajectory, our method enables the robot to rapidly acquire agile
leg-lifting skills, significantly enhancing its capability to traverse
unstructured terrains. The approach has been experimentally validated and
successfully deployed on LimX Dynamics' wheeled bipedal robot, Tron1.
Real-world tests demonstrate that Tron1 can reliably climb obstacles well
beyond its wheel radius using only proprioceptive feedback.

Conclusion: UT³框架成功解决了测试时训练在实时应用中的计算效率问题，为自主系统在连续演化环境中的安全部署提供了可行方案

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are increasingly being used in autonomous
systems. However, DNNs do not generalize well to domain shift. Adapting to a
continuously evolving environment is a safety-critical challenge inevitably
faced by all autonomous systems deployed to the real world. Recent work on
test-time training proposes methods that adapt to a new test distribution on
the fly by optimizing the DNN model for each test input using self-supervision.
However, these techniques result in a sharp increase in inference time as
multiple forward and backward passes are required for a single test sample (for
test-time training) before finally making the prediction based on the
fine-tuned features. This is undesirable for real-world robotics applications
where these models may be deployed to resource constraint hardware with strong
latency requirements. In this work, we propose a new framework (called UT$^3$)
that leverages test-time training for improved performance in the presence of
continuous domain shift while also decreasing the inference time, making it
suitable for real-world applications. Our method proposes an uncertainty-aware
self-supervision task for efficient test-time training that leverages the
quantified uncertainty to selectively apply the training leading to sharp
improvements in the inference time while performing comparably to standard
test-time training protocol. Our proposed protocol offers a continuous setting
to identify the selected keyframes, allowing the end-user to control how often
to apply test-time training. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method on a
dense regression task - monocular depth estimation.

linkage is developed and experimentally validated. We present 2 variants as a
modular design: Forbal-2, a planar 2-DOF manipulator, and its extension to
5-DOF spatial motion called Forbal-5. The design considerations in terms of
geometric, kinematic, and dynamic design that fulfill the force balance
conditions while maximizing workspace are discussed. Then, the inverse
kinematics of both variants are derived from geometric principles.
  We validate the improvements from force balancing the manipulator through
comparative experiments with counter mass balanced and unbalanced
configurations. The results show how the balanced configuration yields a
reduction in the average reaction moments of up to 66\%, a reduction of average
joint torques of up to 79\%, as well as a noticeable reduction in position
error for Forbal-2. For Forbal-5, which has a higher end effector payload mass,
the joint torques are reduced up to 84\% for the balanced configuration.
Experimental results validate that the balanced manipulator design is suitable
for applications where the reduction of joint torques and reaction
forces/moments helps achieve millimeter level precision.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 主动训练框架通过ITSS和AIS策略从多样环境中精选训练数据，仅需52%序列数据就能达到全数据集训练的效果，大大提升深度LiDAR测程模型的训练效率和演化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度LiDAR测程模型需要大量多样化训练数据来适应不同环境，导致训练效率低下。需要一种能够精选训练数据的方法，减少训练负担同时提升模型的演化能力。

Method: 提出两种核心策略：1)ITSS初始训练集选择：将普通天气下的运动序列分解为节点和边进行轨迹分析，优先选择多样化序列构建初始训练集。2)AIS主动增量选择：对复杂序列（如雪天条件）通过场景重建和预测不一致性迭代选择训练样本，精炼模型。

Result: 在多种数据集和天气条件下验证了方法的有效性。仅使用52%的序列数据量就能达到与全数据集训练相等的性能表现，显示了训练效率和演化能力的显著提升。

Conclusion: 该主动训练框架通过优化训练过程，为更灵活可靠的LiDAR测程系统奠定了基础，能够在多样环境条件下实现更高精度的定位和导航。

Abstract: Robust and efficient deep LiDAR odometry models are crucial for accurate
localization and 3D reconstruction, but typically require extensive and diverse
training data to adapt to diverse environments, leading to inefficiencies. To
tackle this, we introduce an active training framework designed to selectively
extract training data from diverse environments, thereby reducing the training
load and enhancing model generalization. Our framework is based on two key
strategies: Initial Training Set Selection (ITSS) and Active Incremental
Selection (AIS). ITSS begins by breaking down motion sequences from general
weather into nodes and edges for detailed trajectory analysis, prioritizing
diverse sequences to form a rich initial training dataset for training the base
model. For complex sequences that are difficult to analyze, especially under
challenging snowy weather conditions, AIS uses scene reconstruction and
prediction inconsistency to iteratively select training samples, refining the
model to handle a wide range of real-world scenarios. Experiments across
datasets and weather conditions validate our approach's effectiveness. Notably,
our method matches the performance of full-dataset training with just 52\% of
the sequence volume, demonstrating the training efficiency and robustness of
our active training paradigm. By optimizing the training process, our approach
sets the stage for more agile and reliable LiDAR odometry systems, capable of
navigating diverse environmental conditions with greater precision.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究直观遥控界面对移动操作机器人的重要性，通过强烈的体验感和最小化身体和认知要求来提高数据收集质量和用户体验，特别是在需要全身协调的长时间线移动操作任务中。

Method: 比较了两种控制范弋：耦合体验（整合手臂操作和底盘导航功能）和解耦体验（将这些系统作为独立控制实体），以及两种视觉反馈机制：沉浸式VR和传统屏幕可视化。通过系统性评估复杂多阶段任务序列来进行分析。

Result: 结果显示使用VR作为反馈方式会增加任务完成时间、认知负荷和遥控者的感知努力。耦合操作和导航导致的用户负荷与解耦相似，但预始实验表明通过耦合遥控获取的数据能够带来更好的模仿学习性能。

Conclusion: 该研究为收集高质量、高维度移动操作数据提供了价值较高的见解，特别是在考虑人类操作员需求的情况下。耦合控制范弋在保持用户体验的同时能够提高数据质量，而VR反馈并不能提高遥控效果。

Abstract: Intuitive Teleoperation interfaces are essential for mobile manipulation
robots to ensure high quality data collection while reducing operator workload.
A strong sense of embodiment combined with minimal physical and cognitive
demands not only enhances the user experience during large-scale data
collection, but also helps maintain data quality over extended periods. This
becomes especially crucial for challenging long-horizon mobile manipulation
tasks that require whole-body coordination. We compare two distinct robot
control paradigms: a coupled embodiment integrating arm manipulation and base
navigation functions, and a decoupled embodiment treating these systems as
separate control entities. Additionally, we evaluate two visual feedback
mechanisms: immersive virtual reality and conventional screen-based
visualization of the robot's field of view. These configurations were
systematically assessed across a complex, multi-stage task sequence requiring
integrated planning and execution. Our results show that the use of VR as a
feedback modality increases task completion time, cognitive workload, and
perceived effort of the teleoperator. Coupling manipulation and navigation
leads to a comparable workload on the user as decoupling the embodiments, while
preliminary experiments suggest that data acquired by coupled teleoperation
leads to better imitation learning performance. Our holistic view on intuitive
teleoperation interfaces provides valuable insight into collecting
high-quality, high-dimensional mobile manipulation data at scale with the human
operator in mind. Project

Motivation: 研究集成大语言模型的社交机器人是否具有有效的说服能力，以以及如何设计机器人来更好地影响人类决策

Method: 设计了一个关于决策制定的实验案例，通过变更机器人外观和自我知识进行测试，使用定性分析评估交互质量、说服效果和沟通策略

Result: 参与者对交互感受正面，认为机器人能干、友好且支持性强，但存在响应延迟和语音识别错误等限制。说服效果与上下文程度相关，参与者更接受礼貌、合理的建议和丰富的手势，希望获得更个性化、上下文敏感的论据和更清晰的社交角色

Conclusion: 生成式社交机器人可以影响用户决策，但效果受到沟通细节和上下文相关性的强烈影响，需要进一步精炼研究案例来深入研究机器人与人类之间的说服动态

Abstract: Integrating generative AI such as large language models into social robots
has improved their ability to engage in natural, human-like communication. This
study presents a method to examine their persuasive capabilities. We designed
an experimental framework focused on decision making and tested it in a pilot
that varied robot appearance and self-knowledge. Using qualitative analysis, we
evaluated interaction quality, persuasion effectiveness, and the robot's
communicative strategies. Participants generally experienced the interaction
positively, describing the robot as competent, friendly, and supportive, while
noting practical limits such as delayed responses and occasional
speech-recognition errors. Persuasiveness was highly context dependent and
shaped by robot behavior: participants responded well to polite, reasoned
suggestions and expressive gestures, but emphasized the need for more
personalized, context-aware arguments and clearer social roles. These findings
suggest that generative social robots can influence user decisions, but their
effectiveness depends on communicative nuance and contextual relevance. We
propose refinements to the framework to further study persuasive dynamics
between robots and human users.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive refurbishment of the interactive robotic
art installation Standards and Double Standards by Rafael Lozano-Hemmer. The
installation features an array of belts suspended from the ceiling, each
actuated by stepper motors and dynamically oriented by a vision-based tracking
system that follows the movements of exhibition visitors. The original system
was limited by oscillatory dynamics, resulting in torsional and pendulum-like
vibrations that constrained rotational speed and reduced interactive
responsiveness. To address these challenges, the refurbishment involved
significant upgrades to both hardware and motion control algorithms. A detailed
mathematical model of the flying belt system was developed to accurately
capture its dynamic behavior, providing a foundation for advanced control
design. An input shaping method, formulated as a convex optimization problem,
was implemented to effectively suppress vibrations, enabling smoother and
faster belt movements. Experimental results demonstrate substantial
improvements in system performance and audience interaction. This work
exemplifies the integration of robotics, control engineering, and interactive
art, offering new solutions to technical challenges in real-time motion control
and vibration damping for large-scale kinetic installations.

Result: 通过3关节机械臂的广泛仿真验证，即使仅使用4个计算核心，也能在安全性和性能方面实现显著改进

Conclusion: 并行计算的安全集约束MPC方法有效提升了机器人系统的安全保证能力，为安全关键控制提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Ensuring constraint satisfaction is a key requirement for safety-critical
systems, which include most robotic platforms. For example, constraints can be
used for modeling joint position/velocity/torque limits and collision
avoidance. Constrained systems are often controlled using Model Predictive
Control, because of its ability to naturally handle constraints, relying on
numerical optimization. However, ensuring constraint satisfaction is
challenging for nonlinear systems/constraints. A well-known tool to make
controllers safe is the so-called control-invariant set (a.k.a. safe set). In
our previous work, we have shown that safety can be improved by letting the
safe-set constraint recede along the MPC horizon. In this paper, we push that
idea further by exploiting parallel computation to improve safety. We solve
several MPC problems at the same time, where each problem instantiates the
safe-set constraint at a different time step along the horizon. Finally, the
controller can select the best solution according to some user-defined
criteria. We validated this idea through extensive simulations with a 3-joint
robotic arm, showing that significant improvements can be achieved in terms of
safety and performance, even using as little as 4 computational cores.

Abstract: The utilization of robotic technology has gained traction in healthcare
facilities due to progress in the field that enables time and cost savings,
minimizes waste, and improves patient care. Digital healthcare technologies
that leverage automation, such as robotics and artificial intelligence, have
the potential to enhance the sustainability and profitability of healthcare
systems in the long run. However, the recent COVID-19 pandemic has amplified
the need for cyber-physical robots to automate check-ups and medication
administration. A robot nurse is controlled by the Internet of Things (IoT) and
can serve as an automated medical assistant while also allowing supervisory
control based on custom commands. This system helps reduce infection risk and
improves outcomes in pandemic settings. This research presents a test case with
a nurse robot that can assess a patient's health status and take action
accordingly. We also evaluate the system's performance in medication
administration, health-status monitoring, and life-cycle considerations.

Abstract: Advancements in onboard computing mean remote sensing agents can employ
state-of-the-art computer vision and machine learning at the edge. These
capabilities can be leveraged to unlock new rare, transient, and pinpoint
measurements of dynamic science phenomena. In this paper, we present an
automated workflow that synthesizes the detection of these dynamic events in
look-ahead satellite imagery with autonomous trajectory planning for a
follow-up high-resolution sensor to obtain pinpoint measurements. We apply this
workflow to the use case of observing volcanic plumes. We analyze
classification approaches including traditional machine learning algorithms and
convolutional neural networks. We present several trajectory planning
algorithms that track the morphological features of a plume and integrate these
algorithms with the classifiers. We show through simulation an order of
magnitude increase in the utility return of the high-resolution instrument
compared to baselines while maintaining efficient runtimes.

TL;DR: 研究发现Waymo开放运动数据集(WOMD)无法准确反映真实自动驾驶车辆的行为动态，特别是在短车距和紧急减速方面存在系统性低估，可能导致行为模型低估实际驾驶的风险和复杂性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估WOMD数据集在自动驾驶行为分析中的有效性，因为该数据集存在专有后处理、缺乏误差量化以及轨迹分段等问题，其真实性存疑。

Method: 使用凤凰城独立收集的L4级自动驾驶自然数据集(PHX)进行对比分析，涵盖信号交叉口通行、跟车和变道三种典型场景。采用手动提取车头时距、SIMEX误差校正和DTW距离量化行为差异。

Result: 所有场景分析一致显示PHX数据的行为特征都超出了WOMD的行为范围，WOMD显著低估了短车距和紧急减速行为。

Conclusion: 仅基于WOMD校准的行为模型可能系统性地低估自然驾驶的变异性、风险和复杂性，使用WOMD进行行为建模时需要谨慎并需用独立数据进行验证。

Abstract: The Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) has become a popular resource for
data-driven modeling of autonomous vehicles (AVs) behavior. However, its
validity for behavioral analysis remains uncertain due to proprietary
post-processing, the absence of error quantification, and the segmentation of
trajectories into 20-second clips. This study examines whether WOMD accurately
captures the dynamics and interactions observed in real-world AV operations.
Leveraging an independently collected naturalistic dataset from Level 4 AV
operations in Phoenix, Arizona (PHX), we perform comparative analyses across
three representative urban driving scenarios: discharging at signalized
intersections, car-following, and lane-changing behaviors. For the discharging
analysis, headways are manually extracted from aerial video to ensure
negligible measurement error. For the car-following and lane-changing cases, we
apply the Simulation-Extrapolation (SIMEX) method to account for empirically
estimated error in the PHX data and use Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distances to
quantify behavioral differences. Results across all scenarios consistently show
that behavior in PHX falls outside the behavioral envelope of WOMD. Notably,
WOMD underrepresents short headways and abrupt decelerations. These findings
suggest that behavioral models calibrated solely on WOMD may systematically
underestimate the variability, risk, and complexity of naturalistic driving.
Caution is therefore warranted when using WOMD for behavior modeling without
proper validation against independently collected data.

Abstract: Robotic manipulation, a key frontier in robotics and embodied AI, requires
precise motor control and multimodal understanding, yet traditional rule-based
methods fail to scale or generalize in unstructured, novel environments. In
recent years, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, built upon Large
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) pretrained on vast image-text datasets, have
emerged as a transformative paradigm. This survey provides the first
systematic, taxonomy-oriented review of large VLM-based VLA models for robotic
manipulation. We begin by clearly defining large VLM-based VLA models and
delineating two principal architectural paradigms: (1) monolithic models,
encompassing single-system and dual-system designs with differing levels of
integration; and (2) hierarchical models, which explicitly decouple planning
from execution via interpretable intermediate representations. Building on this
foundation, we present an in-depth examination of large VLM-based VLA models:
(1) integration with advanced domains, including reinforcement learning,
training-free optimization, learning from human videos, and world model
integration; (2) synthesis of distinctive characteristics, consolidating
architectural traits, operational strengths, and the datasets and benchmarks
that support their development; (3) identification of promising directions,
including memory mechanisms, 4D perception, efficient adaptation, multi-agent
cooperation, and other emerging capabilities. This survey consolidates recent
advances to resolve inconsistencies in existing taxonomies, mitigate research
fragmentation, and fill a critical gap through the systematic integration of
studies at the intersection of large VLMs and robotic manipulation. We provide
a regularly updated project page to document ongoing progress:
