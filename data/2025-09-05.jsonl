On the other hand,\ngenerative approaches leveraging prior knowledge from pre-trained 2D diffusion\nmodels can produce cartoonish, static human avatars, which are animated through\nsimple skeleton-based articulation. Therefore, the avatars generated by these\nmethods suffer from lower rendering quality compared to person-specific\nrendering methods and fail to capture pose-dependent deformations such as cloth\nwrinkles. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that unites the strengths\nof person-specific rendering and diffusion-based generative modeling to enable\ndynamic human avatar generation with both high photorealism and realistic\npose-dependent deformations. Our method follows a two-stage pipeline: first, we\noptimize a set of person-specific UNets, with each network representing a\ndynamic human avatar that captures intricate pose-dependent deformations. In\nthe second stage, we train a hyper diffusion model over the optimized network\nweights. During inference, our method generates network weights for real-time,\ncontrollable rendering of dynamic human avatars. Using a large-scale,\ncross-identity, multi-view video dataset, we demonstrate that our approach\noutperforms state-of-the-art human avatar generation methods."}

The pose\nestimator is a critical component of wall climbing mobile robots, as their\noperational environment involves carrying precise measurement equipment and\nmaintenance tools in construction, requiring information about pose on the\nbuilding at the time of measurement. Due to the complex geometry and material\nproperties of building facades, the use of traditional localization sensors\nsuch as laser, ultrasonic, or radar is often infeasible for wall-climbing\nrobots. Moreover, GPS-based localization is generally unreliable in these\nenvironments because of signal degradation caused by reinforced concrete and\nelectromagnetic interference. Consequently, robot odometry remains the primary\nsource of velocity and position information, despite being susceptible to drift\ncaused by both systematic and non-systematic errors. The calibrations of the\nrobot's systematic parameters were conducted using nonlinear optimization and\nLevenberg-Marquardt methods as Newton-Gauss and gradient-based model fitting\nmethods, while Genetic algorithm and Particle swarm were used as\nstochastic-based methods for kinematic parameter calibration.

These issues\noften stem from missed localized abnormalities, limited global context, and\nvariability in report language. These challenges are amplified in 3D imaging,\nwhere clinicians must examine hundreds of slices per scan. Addressing them\nrequires systems with precise localized detection, global volume-level\nreasoning, and semantically consistent natural language reporting. However,\nexisting 3D vision-language models are unable to meet all three needs jointly,\nlacking local-global understanding for spatial reasoning and struggling with\nthe variability and noise of uncurated radiology reports.

To enable joint disease detection and holistic\ninterpretation, MedVista3D performs local and global image-text alignment for\nfine-grained representation learning within full-volume context.

Identifying paths that reveal the most unknown areas of\nthe object becomes paramount in this context, as it directly affects\nefficiency, and this problem is known as the view path planning problem.\nCurrent methods often use sampling-based path planning techniques, evaluating\npotential views along the path to enhance reconstruction performance. However,\nthese methods are computationally expensive as they require evaluating several\ncandidate views on the path. To this end, we propose a computationally\nefficient solution that relies on calculating a focus point in the most\ninformative (unknown) region and having the robot maintain this point in the\ncamera field of view along the path. We incorporated this strategy into the\nwhole-body control of a mobile manipulator employing a visibility constraint\nwithout the need for an additional path planner. We conducted comprehensive and\nrealistic simulations using a large dataset of 114 diverse objects of varying\nsizes from 57 categories to compare our method with a sampling-based planning\nstrategy using Bayesian data analysis. Furthermore, we performed real-world\nexperiments with an 8-DoF mobile manipulator to demonstrate the proposed\nmethod's performance in practice.

Conventional iterative methods\nand deep learning approaches are often suboptimal, particularly under the\nlow-signal conditions inherent to low-dose and high-speed experiments. These\nlimitations compromise reconstruction fidelity and restrict the broader\nadoption of the technique. In this work, we introduce the Ptychographic\nImplicit Neural Representation (PtyINR), a self-supervised framework that\nsimultaneously addresses the object and probe recovery problem. By\nparameterizing both as continuous neural representations, PtyINR performs\nend-to-end reconstruction directly from raw diffraction patterns without\nrequiring any pre-characterization of the probe. Extensive evaluations\ndemonstrate that PtyINR achieves superior reconstruction quality on both\nsimulated and experimental data, with remarkable robustness under challenging\nlow-signal conditions. Furthermore, PtyINR offers a generalizable,\nphysics-informed framework for addressing probe-dependent inverse problems,\nmaking it applicable to a wide range of computational microscopy problems."}

Velocity Matching (VM) learns\nto stably match the velocity fields between the student and the teacher, but\ninevitably provides biased gradient estimates.
