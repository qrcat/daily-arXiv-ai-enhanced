TL;DR: 通过驾驶模拟器实验研究自动驾驶风根据风根感知，发现车辆运动和皮电导可以预测风险感知，而面部表情识别效果不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 信任和感知安全性对自动驾驶车辆的公众接受度至关重要，需要研究如何对风险感知进行客观评估。

Method: 使用32名参与者在驾驶模拟器上进行实验，测量主观舒适度、车辆运动、面部表情、皮电导、心率和眼动跟踪数据，并使用神经网络模型进行分析。

Result: 动态驾驶风格导致更强的不舒适感，行人跨越会加剧风险感知。面部表情识别效果不好，仅少数人显示惊讶表情。车辆运动和皮电导模型能够有效预测风险感知。

Conclusion: 车辆运动和皮电导可以作为客观风险感知评估的有效方法，而面部表情识别在自动驾驶风险评估中使用限制较多。

Abstract: Trust and perceived safety play a crucial role in the public acceptance of
automated vehicles. To understand perceived risk, an experiment was conducted
using a driving simulator under two automated driving styles and optionally
introducing a crossing pedestrian. Data was collected from 32 participants,
consisting of continuous subjective comfort ratings, motion, webcam footage for
facial expression, skin conductance, heart rate, and eye tracking. The
continuous subjective perceived risk ratings showed significant discomfort
associated with perceived risk during cornering and braking followed by relief
or even positive comfort on continuing the ride. The dynamic driving style
induced a stronger discomfort as compared to the calm driving style. The
crossing pedestrian did not affect discomfort with the calm driving style but
doubled the comfort decrement with the dynamic driving style. This illustrates
the importance of consequences of critical interactions in risk perception.
Facial expression was successfully analyzed for 24 participants but most
(15/24) did not show any detectable facial reaction to the critical event.
Among the 9 participants who did, 8 showed a Happy expression, and only 4
showed a Surprise expression. Fear was never dominant. This indicates that
facial expression recognition is not a reliable method for assessing perceived
risk in automated vehicles. To predict perceived risk a neural network model
was implemented using vehicle motion and skin conductance. The model correlated
well with reported perceived risk, demonstrating its potential for objective
perceived risk assessment in automated vehicles, reducing subjective bias and
highlighting areas for future research.

### [2] [PromptEnhancer: A Simple Approach to Enhance Text-to-Image Models via Chain-of-Thought Prompt Rewriting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04545)
*Linqing Wang,Ximing Xing,Yiji Cheng,Zhiyuan Zhao,Jiale Tao,Qixun Wang,Ruihuang Li,Xin Li,Mingrui Wu,Xinchi Deng,Chunyu Wang,Qinglin Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PromptEnhancer是一个通用的提示词重写框架，通过强化学习训练Chain-of-Thought重写器，显著提升文本到图像模型在复杂提示词下的图像-文本对齐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像扩散模型在处理复杂用户提示时经常出现属性绑定、否定和组合关系方面的失败，导致用户意图与生成结果不匹配。

Method: 提出PromptEnhancer框架，包含：1）基于24个关键点的系统分类法训练的AlignEvaluator奖励模型；2）通过强化学习优化的Chain-of-Thought重写器，无需修改预训练模型权重。

Result: 在HunyuanImage 2.1模型上的广泛实验表明，PromptEnhancer在广泛的语义和组合挑战中显著改善了图像-文本对齐效果。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了一种有效的方法来提升文本到图像模型的提示词理解能力，并引入了新的人类偏好基准数据集来促进未来研究。

Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in generating high-fidelity images. However, these
models often struggle to faithfully render complex user prompts, particularly
in aspects like attribute binding, negation, and compositional relationships.
This leads to a significant mismatch between user intent and the generated
output. To address this challenge, we introduce PromptEnhancer, a novel and
universal prompt rewriting framework that enhances any pretrained T2I model
without requiring modifications to its weights. Unlike prior methods that rely
on model-specific fine-tuning or implicit reward signals like image-reward
scores, our framework decouples the rewriter from the generator. We achieve
this by training a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rewriter through reinforcement
learning, guided by a dedicated reward model we term the AlignEvaluator. The
AlignEvaluator is trained to provide explicit and fine-grained feedback based
on a systematic taxonomy of 24 key points, which are derived from a
comprehensive analysis of common T2I failure modes. By optimizing the CoT
rewriter to maximize the reward from our AlignEvaluator, our framework learns
to generate prompts that are more precisely interpreted by T2I models.
Extensive experiments on the HunyuanImage 2.1 model demonstrate that
PromptEnhancer significantly improves image-text alignment across a wide range
of semantic and compositional challenges. Furthermore, we introduce a new,
high-quality human preference benchmark to facilitate future research in this
direction.

### [3] [Skywork UniPic 2.0: Building Kontext Model with Online RL for Unified Multimodal Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04548)
*Hongyang Wei,Baixin Xu,Hongbo Liu,Cyrus Wu,Jie Liu,Yi Peng,Peiyu Wang,Zexiang Liu,Jingwen He,Yidan Xietian,Chuanxin Tang,Zidong Wang,Yichen Wei,Liang Hu,Boyi Jiang,William Li,Ying He,Yang Liu,Xuchen Song,Eric Li,Yahui Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniPic2-SD3.5M-Kontext是一个2B参数的DiT模型，基于SD3.5-Medium架构改进，通过渐进式双任务强化策略(PDTR)实现了最先进的图像生成和编辑能力，并在多模态统一框架中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的开源多模态模型过于注重参数规模扩展而忽略了训练策略优化，导致效率和性能受限。本文旨在通过优化训练策略而非单纯增加参数来实现更好的图像生成和编辑性能。

Method: 1) 对SD3.5-Medium进行架构修改和大规模高质量数据预训练；2) 提出渐进式双任务强化策略(PDTR)分阶段增强指令跟随和编辑一致性；3) 与Qwen2.5-VL-7B连接进行联合训练构建统一多模态模型UniPic2-Metaquery。

Result: UniPic2-SD3.5M-Kontext在图像生成和编辑方面超越了参数规模更大的模型(BAGEL 7B和Flux-Kontext 12B)，验证了不同任务的强化阶段具有相互促进作用而无负面干扰。UniPic2-Metaquery在多样化任务中达到顶级性能。

Conclusion: 提出的Skywork UniPic 2.0训练范式具有有效性和通用性，证明了通过优化训练策略而非单纯扩展参数规模可以实现更高效的多模态模型性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal models have demonstrated impressive
capabilities in unified image generation and editing. However, many prominent
open-source models prioritize scaling model parameters over optimizing training
strategies, limiting their efficiency and performance. In this work, we present
UniPic2-SD3.5M-Kontext, a 2B-parameter DiT model based on SD3.5-Medium, which
achieves state-of-the-art image generation and editing while extending
seamlessly into a unified multimodal framework. Our approach begins with
architectural modifications to SD3.5-Medium and large-scale pre-training on
high-quality data, enabling joint text-to-image generation and editing
capabilities. To enhance instruction following and editing consistency, we
propose a novel Progressive Dual-Task Reinforcement strategy (PDTR), which
effectively strengthens both tasks in a staged manner. We empirically validate
that the reinforcement phases for different tasks are mutually beneficial and
do not induce negative interference. After pre-training and reinforcement
strategies, UniPic2-SD3.5M-Kontext demonstrates stronger image generation and
editing capabilities than models with significantly larger generation
parameters-including BAGEL (7B) and Flux-Kontext (12B). Furthermore, following
the MetaQuery, we connect the UniPic2-SD3.5M-Kontext and Qwen2.5-VL-7B via a
connector and perform joint training to launch a unified multimodal model
UniPic2-Metaquery. UniPic2-Metaquery integrates understanding, generation, and
editing, achieving top-tier performance across diverse tasks with a simple and
scalable training paradigm. This consistently validates the effectiveness and
generalizability of our proposed training paradigm, which we formalize as
Skywork UniPic 2.0.

### [4] [Inpaint4Drag: Repurposing Inpainting Models for Drag-Based Image Editing via Bidirectional Warping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04582)
*Jingyi Lu,Kai Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Inpaint4Drag是一个基于拖拽的图像编辑框架，通过像素空间双向扭曲和图像修复实现实时编辑，解决了现有方法精度低、反馈延迟和模型依赖的问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于拖拽的图像编辑方法主要依赖生成模型的潜在空间操作，导致精度有限、反馈延迟和模型特定约束，需要更直观高效的解决方案

Method: 将拖拽编辑分解为像素空间双向扭曲和图像修复两个步骤，将图像区域视为可变形材料，实现实时扭曲预览(0.01s)和高效修复(0.3s)

Result: 在512x512分辨率下实现实时性能，相比需要数分钟编辑的现有方法显著提升交互体验，可作为通用适配器兼容任何修复模型

Conclusion: 该方法在保持实时性能的同时实现了卓越的视觉质量和精确控制，为拖拽式图像编辑提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Drag-based image editing has emerged as a powerful paradigm for intuitive
image manipulation. However, existing approaches predominantly rely on
manipulating the latent space of generative models, leading to limited
precision, delayed feedback, and model-specific constraints. Accordingly, we
present Inpaint4Drag, a novel framework that decomposes drag-based editing into
pixel-space bidirectional warping and image inpainting. Inspired by elastic
object deformation in the physical world, we treat image regions as deformable
materials that maintain natural shape under user manipulation. Our method
achieves real-time warping previews (0.01s) and efficient inpainting (0.3s) at
512x512 resolution, significantly improving the interaction experience compared
to existing methods that require minutes per edit. By transforming drag inputs
directly into standard inpainting formats, our approach serves as a universal
adapter for any inpainting model without architecture modification,
automatically inheriting all future improvements in inpainting technology.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior visual
quality and precise control while maintaining real-time performance. Project

### [5] [DisPatch: Disarming Adversarial Patches in Object Detection with Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04597)
*Jin Ma,Mohammed Aldeen,Christopher Salas,Feng Luo,Mashrur Chowdhury,Mert Pesé,Long Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DISPATCH是一个基于扩散模型的物体检测防御框架，采用"再生与修正"策略来对抗对抗性补丁攻击，无需先验知识即可有效防御多种攻击类型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有物体检测器容易受到对抗性补丁攻击，这些攻击可以隐藏真实物体或创建虚假物体，造成严重后果。需要一种有效、通用且能抵抗自适应攻击的防御方法。

Method: 利用扩散模型的生成能力重新生成整个图像，使其与良性数据对齐，然后通过修正过程识别并替换对抗性区域为重新生成的良性对应部分。

Result: 在多种检测器和攻击上表现优异，隐藏攻击的mAP.5达到89.3%，非目标创建攻击成功率降至24.8%，对自适应攻击保持强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: DISPATCH是第一个基于扩散模型的物体检测防御框架，具有攻击无关性、无需先验知识的特点，为物体检测系统提供了实用可靠的防御方案。

Abstract: Object detection is fundamental to various real-world applications, such as
security monitoring and surveillance video analysis. Despite their
advancements, state-of-theart object detectors are still vulnerable to
adversarial patch attacks, which can be easily applied to real-world objects to
either conceal actual items or create non-existent ones, leading to severe
consequences. Given the current diversity of adversarial patch attacks and
potential unknown threats, an ideal defense method should be effective,
generalizable, and robust against adaptive attacks. In this work, we introduce
DISPATCH, the first diffusion-based defense framework for object detection.
Unlike previous works that aim to "detect and remove" adversarial patches,
DISPATCH adopts a "regenerate and rectify" strategy, leveraging generative
models to disarm attack effects while preserving the integrity of the input
image. Specifically, we utilize the in-distribution generative power of
diffusion models to regenerate the entire image, aligning it with benign data.
A rectification process is then employed to identify and replace adversarial
regions with their regenerated benign counterparts. DISPATCH is attack-agnostic
and requires no prior knowledge of the existing patches. Extensive experiments
across multiple detectors and attacks demonstrate that DISPATCH consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art defenses on both hiding attacks and creating
attacks, achieving the best overall mAP.5 score of 89.3% on hiding attacks, and
lowering the attack success rate to 24.8% on untargeted creating attacks.
Moreover, it maintains strong robustness against adaptive attacks, making it a
practical and reliable defense for object detection systems.

*Qijun Ying,Zhongyuan Hu,Rui Zhang,Ronghui Li,Yu Lu,Zijiao Zeng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WATCH是一个从单目视频重建全球人体运动的统一框架，通过解析航向角分解和相机轨迹整合机制，解决了相机方向信息利用不足和相机平移线索整合无效的问题，在野外基准测试中达到了最先进的轨迹重建性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从野外单目视频重建全球人体运动在VR、图形和机器人应用中需求日益增长，但面临深度模糊、运动模糊以及相机与人体运动纠缠等挑战。现有以人体运动为中心的方法在利用相机方向信息和整合相机平移线索方面存在不足。

Method: 提出了WATCH框架，包含两个核心技术：1）解析航向角分解技术，提供比现有几何方法更高效和可扩展的解决方案；2）受世界模型启发的相机轨迹整合机制，有效利用相机平移信息。

Result: 在野外基准测试中，WATCH在端到端轨迹重建方面达到了最先进的性能，证明了联合建模相机-人体运动关系的有效性。

Conclusion: 该工作为解决相机平移整合这一长期挑战提供了新的见解，代码将公开可用。

Abstract: Global human motion reconstruction from in-the-wild monocular videos is
increasingly demanded across VR, graphics, and robotics applications, yet
requires accurate mapping of human poses from camera to world coordinates-a
task challenged by depth ambiguity, motion ambiguity, and the entanglement
between camera and human movements. While human-motion-centric approaches excel
in preserving motion details and physical plausibility, they suffer from two
critical limitations: insufficient exploitation of camera orientation
information and ineffective integration of camera translation cues. We present
WATCH (World-aware Allied Trajectory and pose reconstruction for Camera and
Human), a unified framework addressing both challenges. Our approach introduces
an analytical heading angle decomposition technique that offers superior
efficiency and extensibility compared to existing geometric methods.
Additionally, we design a camera trajectory integration mechanism inspired by
world models, providing an effective pathway for leveraging camera translation
information beyond naive hard-decoding approaches. Through experiments on
in-the-wild benchmarks, WATCH achieves state-of-the-art performance in
end-to-end trajectory reconstruction. Our work demonstrates the effectiveness
of jointly modeling camera-human motion relationships and offers new insights
for addressing the long-standing challenge of camera translation integration in
global human motion reconstruction. The code will be available publicly.

*MinJu Jeon,Si-Woo Kim,Ye-Chan Kim,HyunGee Kim,Dong-Jin Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Sali4Vid是一个基于显著性的密集视频描述框架，通过视频重加权和自适应字幕检索来解决现有方法的时间戳监督不足和场景转换忽略问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有端到端密集视频描述模型存在两个主要问题：(1) 仅对文本应用时间戳监督，而将所有视频帧平等对待；(2) 从固定大小的视频块中检索字幕，忽略了场景转换。

Method: 提出Sali4Vid框架，包含两个核心组件：1) 显著性感知视频重加权 - 将时间戳标注转换为基于sigmoid的帧重要性权重；2) 基于语义的自适应字幕检索 - 通过帧相似性分割视频以捕捉场景转换并改进字幕检索。

Result: 在YouCook2和ViTT数据集上取得了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: 通过联合改进视频加权和检索方法，显著提升了密集视频描述的性能，证明了该框架的有效性。

Abstract: Dense video captioning aims to temporally localize events in video and
generate captions for each event. While recent works propose end-to-end models,
they suffer from two limitations: (1) applying timestamp supervision only to
text while treating all video frames equally, and (2) retrieving captions from
fixed-size video chunks, overlooking scene transitions. To address these, we
propose Sali4Vid, a simple yet effective saliency-aware framework. We introduce
Saliency-aware Video Reweighting, which converts timestamp annotations into
sigmoid-based frame importance weights, and Semantic-based Adaptive Caption
Retrieval, which segments videos by frame similarity to capture scene
transitions and improve caption retrieval. Sali4Vid achieves state-of-the-art
results on YouCook2 and ViTT, demonstrating the benefit of jointly improving
video weighting and retrieval for dense video captioning

Abstract: Traffic congestion and violations pose significant challenges for urban
mobility and road safety. Traditional traffic monitoring systems, such as fixed
cameras and sensor-based methods, are often constrained by limited coverage,
low adaptability, and poor scalability. To address these challenges, this paper
introduces an advanced unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based traffic surveillance
system capable of accurate vehicle detection, classification, tracking, and
behavioral analysis in real-world, unconstrained urban environments. The system
leverages multi-scale and multi-angle template matching, Kalman filtering, and
homography-based calibration to process aerial video data collected from
altitudes of approximately 200 meters. A case study in urban area demonstrates
robust performance, achieving a detection precision of 91.8%, an F1-score of
90.5%, and tracking metrics (MOTA/MOTP) of 92.1% and 93.7%, respectively.
Beyond precise detection, the system classifies five vehicle types and
automatically detects critical traffic violations, including unsafe lane
changes, illegal double parking, and crosswalk obstructions, through the fusion
of geofencing, motion filtering, and trajectory deviation analysis. The
integrated analytics module supports origin-destination tracking, vehicle count
visualization, inter-class correlation analysis, and heatmap-based congestion
modeling. Additionally, the system enables entry-exit trajectory profiling,
vehicle density estimation across road segments, and movement direction
logging, supporting comprehensive multi-scale urban mobility analytics.
Experimental results confirms the system's scalability, accuracy, and practical
relevance, highlighting its potential as an enforcement-aware,
infrastructure-independent traffic monitoring solution for next-generation
smart cities.

*Mustafa Munir,Alex Zhang,Radu Marculescu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VCMamba是一个结合CNN局部特征提取能力和Mamba SSM全局建模能力的新型视觉骨干网络，在ImageNet和ADE20K上取得了优异性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 弥补CNN缺乏全局推理能力和ViT/SSM在细粒度局部特征捕获方面的不足，通过结合CNN和Mamba SSM的优势来构建更强大的视觉骨干网络

Method: 采用卷积stem和分层结构，早期阶段使用卷积块提取局部特征，后期阶段使用多方向Mamba块建模长距离依赖和全局上下文，保持线性复杂度

Result: VCMamba-B在ImageNet-1K上达到82.6% top-1准确率，比PlainMamba-L3高0.3%且参数少37%；在ADE20K上获得47.1 mIoU，比EfficientFormer-L7高2.0 mIoU且参数少62%

Conclusion: VCMamba成功整合了CNN和Mamba SSM的优势，在保持线性复杂度的同时实现了优异的性能，为视觉骨干网络设计提供了新思路

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision Transformers (ViTs) and State Space Models (SSMs)
have challenged the dominance of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in
computer vision. ViTs excel at capturing global context, and SSMs like Mamba
offer linear complexity for long sequences, yet they do not capture
fine-grained local features as effectively as CNNs. Conversely, CNNs possess
strong inductive biases for local features but lack the global reasoning
capabilities of transformers and Mamba. To bridge this gap, we introduce
\textit{VCMamba}, a novel vision backbone that integrates the strengths of CNNs
and multi-directional Mamba SSMs. VCMamba employs a convolutional stem and a
hierarchical structure with convolutional blocks in its early stages to extract
rich local features. These convolutional blocks are then processed by later
stages incorporating multi-directional Mamba blocks designed to efficiently
model long-range dependencies and global context. This hybrid design allows for
superior feature representation while maintaining linear complexity with
respect to image resolution. We demonstrate VCMamba's effectiveness through
extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K classification and ADE20K semantic
segmentation. Our VCMamba-B achieves 82.6% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K,
surpassing PlainMamba-L3 by 0.3% with 37% fewer parameters, and outperforming
Vision GNN-B by 0.3% with 64% fewer parameters. Furthermore, VCMamba-B obtains
47.1 mIoU on ADE20K, exceeding EfficientFormer-L7 by 2.0 mIoU while utilizing
62% fewer parameters. Code is available at
https://github.com/Wertyuui345/VCMamba.

*Vanshika Vats,Ashwani Rathee,James Davis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出多智能体训练免费框架，通过Worker-Supervisor迭代架构协调视觉语言模型，实现复杂文本标注指南下的语义分割，在Waymo和ReasonSeg数据集上表现优异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中的语义分割不仅需要准确掩码，还必须严格遵守复杂的文本标注指南。传统方法依赖昂贵的任务特定重训练，而现有开放词汇方法难以处理段落长度的复杂分割规则

Method: 多智能体训练免费框架，包含Worker执行分割、Supervisor根据检索到的指南进行批判、轻量级强化学习停止策略决定循环终止，确保指南一致性同时平衡资源使用

Result: 在Waymo和ReasonSeg数据集上显著优于最先进基线方法，展现出强大的泛化能力和指令遵循能力

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了复杂标注指南下的语义分割问题，无需重训练即可适应指南变化，在保持高质量分割的同时优化计算资源使用

Abstract: Semantic segmentation in real-world applications often requires not only
accurate masks but also strict adherence to textual labeling guidelines. These
guidelines are typically complex and long, and both human and automated
labeling often fail to follow them faithfully. Traditional approaches depend on
expensive task-specific retraining that must be repeated as the guidelines
evolve. Although recent open-vocabulary segmentation methods excel with simple
prompts, they often fail when confronted with sets of paragraph-length
guidelines that specify intricate segmentation rules. To address this, we
introduce a multi-agent, training-free framework that coordinates
general-purpose vision-language models within an iterative Worker-Supervisor
refinement architecture. The Worker performs the segmentation, the Supervisor
critiques it against the retrieved guidelines, and a lightweight reinforcement
learning stop policy decides when to terminate the loop, ensuring
guideline-consistent masks while balancing resource use. Evaluated on the Waymo
and ReasonSeg datasets, our method notably outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines, demonstrating strong generalization and instruction adherence.

*Satoshi Tanaka,Kok Seang Tan,Isamu Yamashita*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了两种技术来解决3D目标检测中不同传感器配置的域适应问题：下游微调和部分层微调，在多传感器配置数据集上表现优于朴素联合训练


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 不同车辆平台部署不同的传感器配置导致点云分布变化，使在一个配置上训练的模型应用到另一个配置时性能下降，而现有工作主要关注环境域差距和单一LiDAR内的密度变化，不同传感器配置的域差距尚未充分探索

Method: 提出两种技术：1) 下游微调 - 在多数据集训练后进行数据集特定的微调；2) 部分层微调 - 只更新部分层以提高跨配置泛化能力。使用同一地理区域收集的多个传感器配置配对数据集进行实验

Result: 联合训练结合下游微调和部分层微调在每种配置上都一致优于朴素联合训练

Conclusion: 为将3D目标检测模型适应到多样化车辆平台提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案

Abstract: Recent advances in autonomous driving have underscored the importance of
accurate 3D object detection, with LiDAR playing a central role due to its
robustness under diverse visibility conditions. However, different vehicle
platforms often deploy distinct sensor configurations, causing performance
degradation when models trained on one configuration are applied to another
because of shifts in the point cloud distribution. Prior work on multi-dataset
training and domain adaptation for 3D object detection has largely addressed
environmental domain gaps and density variation within a single LiDAR; in
contrast, the domain gap for different sensor configurations remains largely
unexplored. In this work, we address domain adaptation across different sensor
configurations in 3D object detection. We propose two techniques: Downstream
Fine-tuning (dataset-specific fine-tuning after multi-dataset training) and
Partial Layer Fine-tuning (updating only a subset of layers to improve
cross-configuration generalization). Using paired datasets collected in the
same geographic region with multiple sensor configurations, we show that joint
training with Downstream Fine-tuning and Partial Layer Fine-tuning consistently
outperforms naive joint training for each configuration. Our findings provide a
practical and scalable solution for adapting 3D object detection models to the
diverse vehicle platforms.

*Tianxiang Xue,Jiayi Zhao,Jingsheng Li,Changlu Chen,Kun Zhan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出CD-Mamba混合模型，结合卷积神经网络和Mamba状态空间模型，用于遮蓝远感图像的云层检测。该模型同时抓取矩离空间依赖性和长程大气相似性，在多种空间尺度上提高了检测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 远感图像经常被云层遮蓝，影响数据完整性和可靠性。云检测需要同时处理矩离空间冗余和长程大气相似性。现有方法在同时抓取这两种依赖关系方面有限。

Method: 提出CD-Mamba混合模型，将卷积神经网络（CNN）和Mamba状态空间模型集成到统一的云检测网络中。CNN抓取局部空间依赖性，Mamba模型长程依赖性。该设计能够同时处理像素级细节和区域级依赖关系。

Result: 大量实验验证了CD-Mamba的有效性，并证明其在云检测任务上超越了现有方法的性能。模型在多样化的空间尺度上都展现出更高的检测准确性。

Conclusion: CD-Mamba通过结合卷积操作和状态空间模型的优势，成功地同时抓取了局部空间关系和长程依赖性，为遮蓝远感图像的云层检测提供了一种高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Remote sensing images are frequently obscured by cloud cover, posing
significant challenges to data integrity and reliability. Effective cloud
detection requires addressing both short-range spatial redundancies and
long-range atmospheric similarities among cloud patches. Convolutional neural
networks are effective at capturing local spatial dependencies, while Mamba has
strong capabilities in modeling long-range dependencies. To fully leverage both
local spatial relations and long-range dependencies, we propose CD-Mamba, a
hybrid model that integrates convolution and Mamba's state-space modeling into
a unified cloud detection network. CD-Mamba is designed to comprehensively
capture pixelwise textural details and long term patchwise dependencies for
cloud detection. This design enables CD-Mamba to manage both pixel-wise
interactions and extensive patch-wise dependencies simultaneously, improving
detection accuracy across diverse spatial scales. Extensive experiments
validate the effectiveness of CD-Mamba and demonstrate its superior performance
over existing methods.

Conclusion: TCT框架能够有效解决类别不平衡问题，无需额外模型，在多样化临床数据上表现优异。

Abstract: Versatile medical image segmentation (VMIS) targets the segmentation of
multiple classes, while obtaining full annotations for all classes is often
impractical due to the time and labor required. Leveraging partially labeled
datasets (PLDs) presents a promising alternative; however, current VMIS
approaches face significant class imbalance due to the unequal category
distribution in PLDs. Existing methods attempt to address this by generating
pseudo-full labels. Nevertheless, these typically require additional models and
often result in potential performance degradation from label noise. In this
work, we introduce a Task Consistency Training (TCT) framework to address class
imbalance without requiring extra models. TCT includes a backbone network with
a main segmentation head (MSH) for multi-channel predictions and multiple
auxiliary task heads (ATHs) for task-specific predictions. By enforcing a
consistency constraint between the MSH and ATH predictions, TCT effectively
utilizes unlabeled anatomical structures. To avoid error propagation from
low-consistency, potentially noisy data, we propose a filtering strategy to
exclude such data. Additionally, we introduce a unified auxiliary
uncertainty-weighted loss (UAUWL) to mitigate segmentation quality declines
caused by the dominance of specific tasks. Extensive experiments on eight
abdominal datasets from diverse clinical sites demonstrate our approach's
effectiveness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出两种不确定性感知方法来增强SAM和SAM2在恶劣天气条件下的分割鲁棒性，通过多步微调和UAT适配器改进自动驾驶场景的分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉基础模型（如SAM和SAM2）在视觉模糊性高的恶劣天气条件下表现不佳，缺乏不确定性量化，而自动驾驶等安全关键应用需要更可靠的分割结果。

Method: 1）为SAM2设计多步微调程序，将不确定性指标直接融入损失函数；2）将医学影像中的不确定性感知适配器（UAT）适配到驾驶场景。

Result: 在CamVid、BDD100K和GTA驾驶数据集上的实验表明，UAT-SAM在极端天气下优于标准SAM，而带有不确定性感知损失的SAM2在多样化驾驶场景中表现更佳。

Conclusion: 显式的不确定性建模对于在挑战性环境中实现安全关键的自动驾驶具有重要价值，不确定性感知方法能显著提升分割模型在恶劣条件下的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision foundation models, such as the Segment Anything
Model (SAM) and its successor SAM2, have achieved state-of-the-art performance
on general image segmentation benchmarks. However, these models struggle in
adverse weather conditions where visual ambiguity is high, largely due to their
lack of uncertainty quantification. Inspired by progress in medical imaging,
where uncertainty-aware training has improved reliability in ambiguous cases,
we investigate two approaches to enhance segmentation robustness for autonomous
driving. First, we introduce a multi-step finetuning procedure for SAM2 that
incorporates uncertainty metrics directly into the loss function, improving
overall scene recognition. Second, we adapt the Uncertainty-Aware Adapter
(UAT), originally designed for medical image segmentation, to driving contexts.
We evaluate both methods on CamVid, BDD100K, and GTA driving datasets.
Experiments show that UAT-SAM outperforms standard SAM in extreme weather,
while SAM2 with uncertainty-aware loss achieves improved performance across
diverse driving scenes. These findings underscore the value of explicit
uncertainty modeling for safety-critical autonomous driving in challenging
environments.

environments remains elusive. We present WatchHAR, an audio and inertial-based
HAR system that operates fully on smartwatches, addressing privacy and latency
issues associated with external data processing. By optimizing each component

a novel architecture that unifies sensor data preprocessing and inference into
an end-to-end trainable module, achieving 5x faster processing while

outperforms state-of-the-art models for event detection and activity
classification while running directly on the smartwatch, achieving 9.3 ms
processing time for activity event detection and 11.8 ms for multimodal
activity classification. This research advances on-device activity recognition,
realizing smartwatches' potential as standalone, privacy-aware, and
minimally-invasive continuous activity tracking devices.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MCANet是一个用于飓风后损害评估的多标签分类框架，通过多尺度特征学习和类别特定注意力机制，在RescueNet数据集上实现了91.75%的mAP，优于多个基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的CNN方法难以捕捉多尺度空间特征，且难以区分视觉相似或共现的损害类型，这限制了飓风后损害评估的准确性和效率。

Method: 提出MCANet框架，采用Res2Net分层骨干网络丰富多尺度空间上下文，并使用多头类别特定残差注意力模块增强判别能力，每个注意力分支关注不同空间粒度。

Result: 在RescueNet数据集（4,494张UAV图像）上达到91.75% mAP，优于ResNet、Res2Net等模型；使用8个注意力头时性能提升至92.35%，对Road Blocked等困难类别的AP提升超过6%。

Conclusion: MCANet能够准确定位损害相关区域，支持可解释性，其输出可为灾后风险制图、应急路由等提供信息。未来可集成灾害知识图谱和多模态大语言模型提升适应性。

Abstract: Rapid and accurate post-hurricane damage assessment is vital for disaster
response and recovery. Yet existing CNN-based methods struggle to capture
multi-scale spatial features and to distinguish visually similar or
co-occurring damage types. To address these issues, we propose MCANet, a
multi-label classification framework that learns multi-scale representations
and adaptively attends to spatially relevant regions for each damage category.
MCANet employs a Res2Net-based hierarchical backbone to enrich spatial context
across scales and a multi-head class-specific residual attention module to
enhance discrimination. Each attention branch focuses on different spatial
granularities, balancing local detail with global context. We evaluate MCANet
on the RescueNet dataset of 4,494 UAV images collected after Hurricane Michael.
MCANet achieves a mean average precision (mAP) of 91.75%, outperforming ResNet,
Res2Net, VGG, MobileNet, EfficientNet, and ViT. With eight attention heads,
performance further improves to 92.35%, boosting average precision for
challenging classes such as Road Blocked by over 6%. Class activation mapping
confirms MCANet's ability to localize damage-relevant regions, supporting
interpretability. Outputs from MCANet can inform post-disaster risk mapping,
emergency routing, and digital twin-based disaster response. Future work could
integrate disaster-specific knowledge graphs and multimodal large language
models to improve adaptability to unseen disasters and enrich semantic
understanding for real-world decision-making.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于VLM的动态人群检测方法，通过结合局部外观特征和全局场景上下文，并使用图论进行全局优化来处理组织结构的动态变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的人群检测方法假设视频中的群体不变，无法处理动态变化的组织结构。识别复杂群体需要考虑无组成员的局部外观特征和全局场景上下文。

Method: 使用组检测增强的视觉-语言模型(VLM)提取每帧的局部和全局外观特征，然后通过图论对所有帧的组织概率进行全局优化来检测动态变化的群体。

Result: 在公开数据集上，该方法的性能超过了现有的最先进群体检测方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合VLM特征提取和全局优化，有效地处理了动态变化人群的检测问题，为复杂场景下的组织识别提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper proposes dynamic human group detection in videos. For detecting
complex groups, not only the local appearance features of in-group members but
also the global context of the scene are important. Such local and global
appearance features in each frame are extracted using a Vision-Language Model
(VLM) augmented for group detection in our method. For further improvement, the
group structure should be consistent over time. While previous methods are
stabilized on the assumption that groups are not changed in a video, our method
detects dynamically changing groups by global optimization using a graph with
all frames' groupness probabilities estimated by our groupness-augmented CLIP
features. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art group detection methods on public datasets. Code:

TL;DR: FloodVision是一个零样本洪水深度估计框架，结合GPT-4o视觉语言模型和领域知识图谱，通过识别参考物体和统计过滤实现准确的洪水深度估计，在110张图像上达到8.17厘米的平均绝对误差。

Motivation: 现有计算机视觉方法在洪水检测中存在精度限制和泛化能力差的问题，依赖固定物体检测器和特定任务训练，需要开发能够跨不同洪水场景准确估计深度的通用方法。

Method: 结合GPT-4o的语义推理能力和结构化领域知识图谱，动态识别RGB图像中的参考物体，从知识图谱检索验证高度，估计淹没比例，应用统计异常值过滤计算最终深度值。

Result: 在MyCoast New York的110张众包图像上评估，平均绝对误差为8.17厘米，比GPT-4o基线降低20.5%，优于之前的CNN方法，在不同场景中泛化良好且接近实时运行。

Conclusion: FloodVision框架适合未来集成到数字孪生平台和公民报告应用中，为智慧城市洪水韧性提供有效的深度估计解决方案。

Abstract: Timely and accurate floodwater depth estimation is critical for road
accessibility and emergency response. While recent computer vision methods have
enabled flood detection, they suffer from both accuracy limitations and poor
generalization due to dependence on fixed object detectors and task-specific
training. To enable accurate depth estimation that can generalize across
diverse flood scenarios, this paper presents FloodVision, a zero-shot framework
that combines the semantic reasoning abilities of the foundation
vision-language model GPT-4o with a structured domain knowledge graph. The
knowledge graph encodes canonical real-world dimensions for common urban
objects including vehicles, people, and infrastructure elements to ground the
model's reasoning in physical reality. FloodVision dynamically identifies
visible reference objects in RGB images, retrieves verified heights from the
knowledge graph to mitigate hallucination, estimates submergence ratios, and
applies statistical outlier filtering to compute final depth values. Evaluated
on 110 crowdsourced images from MyCoast New York, FloodVision achieves a mean
absolute error of 8.17 cm, reducing the GPT-4o baseline 10.28 cm by 20.5% and
surpassing prior CNN-based methods. The system generalizes well across varying
scenes and operates in near real-time, making it suitable for future
integration into digital twin platforms and citizen-reporting apps for smart
city flood resilience.

Method: 提出PIG方法，包含伪查询生成器为每个视频生成伪查询，使视频特征和文本特征在细粒度层面交互，在推理阶段不增加额外计算开销

Result: 在5个常用文本-视频检索基准测试中，R@1指标提升1.6%~3.9%，效率与双塔模型相当，接近最先进性能

Conclusion: 混合塔框架成功结合了双塔和单塔方法的优势，在保持高效率的同时显著提升了检索效果

Abstract: The Text-to-Video Retrieval (T2VR) task aims to retrieve unlabeled videos by
textual queries with the same semantic meanings. Recent CLIP-based approaches
have explored two frameworks: Two-Tower versus Single-Tower framework, yet the
former suffers from low effectiveness, while the latter suffers from low
efficiency. In this study, we explore a new Hybrid-Tower framework that can
hybridize the advantages of the Two-Tower and Single-Tower framework, achieving
high effectiveness and efficiency simultaneously. We propose a novel hybrid
method, Fine-grained Pseudo-query Interaction and Generation for T2VR, ie, PIG,
which includes a new pseudo-query generator designed to generate a pseudo-query
for each video. This enables the video feature and the textual features of
pseudo-query to interact in a fine-grained manner, similar to the Single-Tower
approaches to hold high effectiveness, even before the real textual query is
received. Simultaneously, our method introduces no additional storage or
computational overhead compared to the Two-Tower framework during the inference
stage, thus maintaining high efficiency. Extensive experiments on five commonly
used text-video retrieval benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves a
significant improvement over the baseline, with an increase of $1.6\% \sim
3.9\%$ in R@1. Furthermore, our method matches the efficiency of Two-Tower
models while achieving near state-of-the-art performance, highlighting the
advantages of the Hybrid-Tower framework.

Abstract: The classification of 3D point clouds is crucial for applications such as
autonomous driving, robotics, and augmented reality. However, the commonly used
ModelNet40 dataset suffers from limitations such as inconsistent labeling, 2D
data, size mismatches, and inadequate class differentiation, which hinder model
performance. This paper introduces ModelNet-R, a meticulously refined version

benchmark. Additionally, this paper proposes Point-SkipNet, a lightweight
graph-based neural network that leverages efficient sampling, neighborhood
grouping, and skip connections to achieve high classification accuracy with
reduced computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that models
trained in ModelNet-R exhibit significant performance improvements. Notably,
Point-SkipNet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on ModelNet-R with a
substantially lower parameter count compared to contemporary models. This
research highlights the crucial role of dataset quality in optimizing model
efficiency for 3D point cloud classification. For more details, see the code

Conclusion: 预处理和学习型方法对于在不同条件下实现鲁棒的月球图像配准至关重要，SuperGlue在跨模态月球图像配准中表现最优

Abstract: Accurate image registration is critical for lunar exploration, enabling
surface mapping, resource localization, and mission planning. Aligning data
from diverse lunar sensors -- optical (e.g., Orbital High Resolution Camera,
Narrow and Wide Angle Cameras), hyperspectral (Imaging Infrared Spectrometer),
and radar (e.g., Dual-Frequency Synthetic Aperture Radar, Selene/Kaguya
mission) -- is challenging due to differences in resolution, illumination, and
sensor distortion. We evaluate five feature matching algorithms: SIFT, ASIFT,
AKAZE, RIFT2, and SuperGlue (a deep learning-based matcher), using
cross-modality image pairs from equatorial and polar regions. A preprocessing
pipeline is proposed, including georeferencing, resolution alignment, intensity
normalization, and enhancements like adaptive histogram equalization, principal
component analysis, and shadow correction. SuperGlue consistently yields the
lowest root mean square error and fastest runtimes. Classical methods such as
SIFT and AKAZE perform well near the equator but degrade under polar lighting.
The results highlight the importance of preprocessing and learning-based
approaches for robust lunar image registration across diverse conditions.

Abstract: Skin diseases are among the most prevalent health concerns worldwide, yet
conventional diagnostic methods are often costly, complex, and unavailable in
low-resource settings. Automated classification using deep learning has emerged
as a promising alternative, but existing studies are mostly limited to
dermoscopic datasets and a narrow range of disease classes. In this work, we
curate a large dataset of over 50 skin disease categories captured with mobile
devices, making it more representative of real-world conditions. We evaluate
multiple convolutional neural networks and Transformer-based architectures,
demonstrating that Transformer models, particularly the Swin Transformer,
achieve superior performance by effectively capturing global contextual
features. To enhance interpretability, we incorporate Gradient-weighted Class
Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), which highlights clinically relevant regions and
provides transparency in model predictions. Our results underscore the
potential of Transformer-based approaches for mobile-acquired skin lesion
classification, paving the way toward accessible AI-assisted dermatological

Conclusion: 专家混合模型是量化预测不确定性的有效方法，特别是在安全关键应用中，通过适当的不确定性提取方法和门控机制设计，可以获得良好校准的不确定性估计。

Abstract: Estimating accurate and well-calibrated predictive uncertainty is important
for enhancing the reliability of computer vision models, especially in
safety-critical applications like traffic scene perception. While ensemble
methods are commonly used to quantify uncertainty by combining multiple models,
a mixture of experts (MoE) offers an efficient alternative by leveraging a
gating network to dynamically weight expert predictions based on the input.
Building on the promising use of MoEs for semantic segmentation in our previous
works, we show that well-calibrated predictive uncertainty estimates can be
extracted from MoEs without architectural modifications. We investigate three
methods to extract predictive uncertainty estimates: predictive entropy, mutual
information, and expert variance. We evaluate these methods for an MoE with two
experts trained on a semantical split of the A2D2 dataset. Our results show
that MoEs yield more reliable uncertainty estimates than ensembles in terms of
conditional correctness metrics under out-of-distribution (OOD) data.
Additionally, we evaluate routing uncertainty computed via gate entropy and
find that simple gating mechanisms lead to better calibration of routing
uncertainty estimates than more complex classwise gates. Finally, our
experiments on the Cityscapes dataset suggest that increasing the number of
experts can further enhance uncertainty calibration. Our code is available at

Motivation: 现有Mamba方法在光场图像超分辨率中存在多方向扫描策略效率低下和特征冗余问题，且状态空间在保持空间-角度和视差信息方面存在局限

Method: 提出子空间简单扫描策略(Sub-SS)和子空间简单Mamba块(SSMB)；采用双阶段建模：阶段I使用空间-角度残差子空间Mamba块(SA-RSMB)进行浅层特征提取，阶段II使用极平面Mamba块(EPMB)和极平面Transformer块(EPTB)的双分支并行结构进行深度特征精炼

Result: 在真实和合成光场数据集上显著超越当前最先进方法，在保持低计算复杂度的同时实现了性能的实质性提升

Conclusion: LFMT框架成功整合了Mamba和Transformer的优势，能够全面探索空间、角度和极平面域的信息，为光场图像超分辨率提供了高效的解决方案

Abstract: Recently, Mamba-based methods, with its advantage in long-range information
modeling and linear complexity, have shown great potential in optimizing both
computational cost and performance of light field image super-resolution
(LFSR). However, current multi-directional scanning strategies lead to
inefficient and redundant feature extraction when applied to complex LF data.
To overcome this challenge, we propose a Subspace Simple Scanning (Sub-SS)
strategy, based on which we design the Subspace Simple Mamba Block (SSMB) to
achieve more efficient and precise feature extraction. Furthermore, we propose
a dual-stage modeling strategy to address the limitation of state space in
preserving spatial-angular and disparity information, thereby enabling a more
comprehensive exploration of non-local spatial-angular correlations.
Specifically, in stage I, we introduce the Spatial-Angular Residual Subspace
Mamba Block (SA-RSMB) for shallow spatial-angular feature extraction; in stage
II, we use a dual-branch parallel structure combining the Epipolar Plane Mamba
Block (EPMB) and Epipolar Plane Transformer Block (EPTB) for deep epipolar
feature refinement. Building upon meticulously designed modules and strategies,
we introduce a hybrid Mamba-Transformer framework, termed LFMT. LFMT integrates
the strengths of Mamba and Transformer models for LFSR, enabling comprehensive
information exploration across spatial, angular, and epipolar-plane domains.
Experimental results demonstrate that LFMT significantly outperforms current
state-of-the-art methods in LFSR, achieving substantial improvements in
performance while maintaining low computational complexity on both real-word
and synthetic LF datasets.

Conclusion: PropVG通过整合候选框生成和目标理解，结合对比学习和多粒度判别，显著提升了视觉定位的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Recent advances in visual grounding have largely shifted away from
traditional proposal-based two-stage frameworks due to their inefficiency and
high computational complexity, favoring end-to-end direct reference paradigms.
However, these methods rely exclusively on the referred target for supervision,
overlooking the potential benefits of prominent prospective targets. Moreover,
existing approaches often fail to incorporate multi-granularity discrimination,
which is crucial for robust object identification in complex scenarios. To
address these limitations, we propose PropVG, an end-to-end proposal-based
framework that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to seamlessly
integrate foreground object proposal generation with referential object
comprehension without requiring additional detectors. Furthermore, we introduce
a Contrastive-based Refer Scoring (CRS) module, which employs contrastive
learning at both sentence and word levels to enhance the capability in
understanding and distinguishing referred objects. Additionally, we design a
Multi-granularity Target Discrimination (MTD) module that fuses object- and
semantic-level information to improve the recognition of absent targets.
Extensive experiments on gRefCOCO (GREC/GRES), Ref-ZOM, R-RefCOCO, and RefCOCO
(REC/RES) benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of PropVG. The codes and

critical for advancing high-speed propulsion technologies. However, the large
scale and high dimensionality of simulation-generated temporal flow field data
present significant challenges for visual interpretation, feature
differentiation, and cross-case comparison. In this paper, we present
TemporalFlowViz, a parameter-aware visual analytics workflow and system
designed to support expert-driven clustering, visualization, and interpretation
of temporal flow fields from scramjet combustion simulations. Our approach
leverages hundreds of simulated combustion cases with varying initial
conditions, each producing time-sequenced flow field images. We use pretrained
Vision Transformers to extract high-dimensional embeddings from these frames,
apply dimensionality reduction and density-based clustering to uncover latent
combustion modes, and construct temporal trajectories in the embedding space to
track the evolution of each simulation over time. To bridge the gap between
latent representations and expert reasoning, domain specialists annotate
representative cluster centroids with descriptive labels. These annotations are
used as contextual prompts for a vision-language model, which generates
natural-language summaries for individual frames and full simulation cases. The
system also supports parameter-based filtering, similarity-based case
retrieval, and coordinated multi-view exploration to facilitate in-depth
analysis. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TemporalFlowViz through two
expert-informed case studies and expert feedback, showing TemporalFlowViz
enhances hypothesis generation, supports interpretable pattern discovery, and
enhances knowledge discovery in large-scale scramjet combustion analysis.

TL;DR: OmniFHT是一种无需姿态信息的3D折射率重建框架，通过傅里叶衍射定理和隐式神经表示，实现了对任意形状细胞在流动中的高精度三维成像，突破了传统方法对球形细胞和单轴旋转的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3D定量相位成像方法假设细胞在微流道中做均匀单轴旋转且姿态已知，这限制了方法对近球形细胞的适用性，无法准确成像具有复杂旋转的不规则形状细胞，导致只能分析细胞群体的子集。

Method: 结合傅里叶衍射定理和隐式神经表示(INRs)，通过联合优化每个细胞的未知旋转轨迹和体积结构，在弱散射假设下支持任意细胞几何形状和多轴旋转。连续表示允许从稀疏采样投影和有限角度覆盖进行准确重建。

Result: OmniFHT能够使用少至10个视图或仅120度角度范围产生高保真结果，首次实现了对整个流动细胞群体的原位高通量断层成像。

Conclusion: 该方法为流式细胞术平台提供了可扩展且无偏见的无标记形态计量分析解决方案，突破了传统成像限制。

Abstract: High-throughput 3D quantitative phase imaging (QPI) in flow cytometry enables
label-free, volumetric characterization of individual cells by reconstructing
their refractive index (RI) distributions from multiple viewing angles during
flow through microfluidic channels. However, current imaging methods assume
that cells undergo uniform, single-axis rotation, which require their poses to
be known at each frame. This assumption restricts applicability to
near-spherical cells and prevents accurate imaging of irregularly shaped cells
with complex rotations. As a result, only a subset of the cellular population
can be analyzed, limiting the ability of flow-based assays to perform robust
statistical analysis. We introduce OmniFHT, a pose-free 3D RI reconstruction
framework that leverages the Fourier diffraction theorem and implicit neural
representations (INRs) for high-throughput flow cytometry tomographic imaging.
By jointly optimizing each cell's unknown rotational trajectory and volumetric
structure under weak scattering assumptions, OmniFHT supports arbitrary cell
geometries and multi-axis rotations. Its continuous representation also allows
accurate reconstruction from sparsely sampled projections and restricted
angular coverage, producing high-fidelity results with as few as 10 views or
only 120 degrees of angular range. OmniFHT enables, for the first time, in
situ, high-throughput tomographic imaging of entire flowing cell populations,
providing a scalable and unbiased solution for label-free morphometric analysis
in flow cytometry platforms.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoRe-GS是一种基于语义高斯泼溅的快速3D重建方法，通过粗粒度语义分割和颜色过滤技术，专注于重建感兴趣对象，将训练时间减少约25%，同时保持高质量的新视角合成效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 移动机器人自主重建在远程指导和灾难响应等关键应用中具有重要价值。这些任务需要准确的3D重建和快速场景处理，但传统方法重建整个场景效率低下。通过专注于特定感兴趣对象，可以显著提高重建效率。

Method: 首先使用语义高斯泼溅生成粗粒度可分割场景，然后采用新颖的基于颜色的有效过滤技术对语义对象进行精炼，实现有效的对象隔离。这种方法在完整训练周期完成前就能实现语义3D高斯编辑。

Result: 在两个数据集（SCRREAM真实室外场景和NeRDS 360合成室内场景）上的评估显示，该方法将训练时间减少约四分之一，同时获得了更高的新视角合成质量。

Conclusion: CoRe-GS方法成功平衡了高质量重建和减少训练时间的需求，通过专注于感兴趣对象的语义重建，为移动机器人自主3D重建提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Mobile reconstruction for autonomous aerial robotics holds strong potential
for critical applications such as tele-guidance and disaster response. These
tasks demand both accurate 3D reconstruction and fast scene processing. Instead
of reconstructing the entire scene in detail, it is often more efficient to
focus on specific objects, i.e., points of interest (PoIs). Mobile robots
equipped with advanced sensing can usually detect these early during data
acquisition or preliminary analysis, reducing the need for full-scene
optimization. Gaussian Splatting (GS) has recently shown promise in delivering
high-quality novel view synthesis and 3D representation by an incremental
learning process. Extending GS with scene editing, semantics adds useful
per-splat features to isolate objects effectively.
  Semantic 3D Gaussian editing can already be achieved before the full training
cycle is completed, reducing the overall training time. Moreover, the
semantically relevant area, the PoI, is usually already known during capturing.
To balance high-quality reconstruction with reduced training time, we propose
CoRe-GS. We first generate a coarse segmentation-ready scene with semantic GS
and then refine it for the semantic object using our novel color-based
effective filtering for effective object isolation. This is speeding up the
training process to be about a quarter less than a full training cycle for
semantic GS. We evaluate our approach on two datasets, SCRREAM (real-world,
outdoor) and NeRDS 360 (synthetic, indoor), showing reduced runtime and higher
novel-view-synthesis quality.

Motivation: 当前前列腺癌冷冻消融治疗的手动术前规划依赖专家经验、耗时且质量不一，需要自动化解决方案来提高治疗质量和可扩展性。

Method: 将冷冻消融规划建模为马尔可夫决策过程，在模拟临床约束和术中变异性的环境中，通过强化学习代理顺序选择冷冻针位置和冰球直径，基于肿瘤覆盖率的奖励函数指导学习最优策略。

Conclusion: 强化学习能够提供临床可行、可重复且高效的冷冻消融规划方案，具有重要的临床应用潜力。

Abstract: Cryoablation is a minimally invasive localised treatment for prostate cancer
that destroys malignant tissue during de-freezing, while sparing surrounding
healthy structures. Its success depends on accurate preoperative planning of
cryoprobe placements to fully cover the tumour and avoid critical anatomy. This
planning is currently manual, expertise-dependent, and time-consuming, leading
to variability in treatment quality and limited scalability. In this work, we
introduce Cryo-RL, a reinforcement learning framework that models cryoablation
planning as a Markov decision process and learns an optimal policy for
cryoprobe placement. Within a simulated environment that models clinical
constraints and stochastic intraoperative variability, an agent sequentially
selects cryoprobe positions and ice sphere diameters. Guided by a reward
function based on tumour coverage, this agent learns a cryoablation strategy
that leads to optimal cryoprobe placements without the need for any
manually-designed plans. Evaluated on 583 retrospective prostate cancer cases,
Cryo-RL achieved over 8 percentage-point Dice improvements compared with the
best automated baselines, based on geometric optimisation, and matched human
expert performance while requiring substantially less planning time. These
results highlight the potential of reinforcement learning to deliver clinically
viable, reproducible, and efficient cryoablation plans.

Motivation: 为开发自适应计算机化暴露治疗系统，研究预训练计算机视觉模型是否能准确从蜘蛛相关图像预测恐惧水平

Method: 采用三种不同的预训练模型进行迁移学习，在包含313张图像的标准数据集上预测0-100尺度的恐惧评分，使用交叉验证评估，并进行学习曲线和可解释性分析

Result: 模型平均MAE在10.1-11.0之间，学习曲线显示减少数据集大小会显著损害性能，可解释性评估确认预测基于蜘蛛相关特征，远距离视图和人造蜘蛛等视觉条件误差较高

Conclusion: 研究证明了可解释计算机视觉模型在预测恐惧评分方面的潜力，强调了模型可解释性和足够数据集大小对于开发有效情感感知治疗技术的重要性

Abstract: Advances in computer vision have opened new avenues for clinical
applications, particularly in computerized exposure therapy where visual
stimuli can be dynamically adjusted based on patient responses. As a critical
step toward such adaptive systems, we investigated whether pretrained computer
vision models can accurately predict fear levels from spider-related images. We
adapted three diverse models using transfer learning to predict human fear
ratings (on a 0-100 scale) from a standardized dataset of 313 images. The
models were evaluated using cross-validation, achieving an average mean
absolute error (MAE) between 10.1 and 11.0. Our learning curve analysis
revealed that reducing the dataset size significantly harmed performance,
though further increases yielded no substantial gains. Explainability
assessments showed the models' predictions were based on spider-related
features. A category-wise error analysis further identified visual conditions
associated with higher errors (e.g., distant views and artificial/painted
spiders). These findings demonstrate the potential of explainable computer
vision models in predicting fear ratings, highlighting the importance of both
model explainability and a sufficient dataset size for developing effective
emotion-aware therapeutic technologies.

Motivation: 工业设备磨损检测对预测性维护至关重要，但真实数据收集成本高、时间长，缺乏多种磨损场景的数据集

Method: 结合视觉语言模型和3D模拟渲染引擎，生成不同锈辟条件下的合成数据

Result: 使用合成数据训练的锈辟检测模型在实际工业物体图像上达到了0.87 mAP50的高分，超过其他方法

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效生成高质量的合成数据，且可自定义扩展到其他工业磨损检测场景

Abstract: We propose an approach to generate synthetic data to train computer vision
(CV) models for industrial wear and tear detection. Wear and tear detection is
an important CV problem for predictive maintenance tasks in any industry.
However, data curation for training such models is expensive and time-consuming
due to the unavailability of datasets for different wear and tear scenarios.
Our approach employs a vision language model along with a 3D simulation and
rendering engine to generate synthetic data for varying rust conditions. We
evaluate our approach by training a CV model for rust detection using the
generated dataset and tested the trained model on real images of rusted
industrial objects. The model trained with the synthetic data generated by our
approach, outperforms the other approaches with a mAP50 score of 0.87. The
approach is customizable and can be easily extended to other industrial wear
and tear detection scenarios

TL;DR: 基于注意力机制的多实例学习框架用于皮脊细胞图像分析，基础MLP模型在稳定性方面更优于注意力MIL模型


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 皮脊细胞内脂貂计数是关键指标，手动计数劳动强度大且主观，需要自动化解决方案

Method: 使用Nile Red染色皮脊细胞图像，按脂貂数量分为14个类别，通过数据增广扩展到约50,000个细胞。比较了基于聚合片层计数的多层感知机基线模型和使用ResNet-50特征的注意力机制MIL模型

Result: 五折交叉验证显示，基线MLP模型达到更稳定的性能（平均MAE=5.6），注意力MIL模型表现不如基线稳定（平均MAE=10.7）但在某些折叠中更优

Conclusion: 简单的包级聚合方法可作为滑片级脂貂计数的稳健基线，注意力MIL需要任务对齐池化和正则化才能充分发挥其潜力

Abstract: Sebocytes are lipid-secreting cells whose differentiation is marked by the
accumulation of intracellular lipid droplets, making their quantification a key
readout in sebocyte biology. Manual counting is labor-intensive and subjective,
motivating automated solutions. Here, we introduce a simple attention-based
multiple instance learning (MIL) framework for sebocyte image analysis. Nile
Red-stained sebocyte images were annotated into 14 classes according to droplet
counts, expanded via data augmentation to about 50,000 cells. Two models were
benchmarked: a baseline multi-layer perceptron (MLP) trained on aggregated
patch-level counts, and an attention-based MIL model leveraging ResNet-50
features with instance weighting. Experiments using five-fold cross-validation
showed that the baseline MLP achieved more stable performance (mean MAE = 5.6)
compared with the attention-based MIL, which was less consistent (mean MAE =
10.7) but occasionally superior in specific folds. These findings indicate that
simple bag-level aggregation provides a robust baseline for slide-level droplet
counting, while attention-based MIL requires task-aligned pooling and
regularization to fully realize its potential in sebocyte image analysis.

Motivation: 单图像新视角合成任务由于未观察区域存在多重解释而高度不适定，现有方法通常基于模糊先验和输入视图附近的插值生成未见区域，容易导致严重失真。

Method: 构建检索和增强系统，使用多模态大语言模型选择合适参考图像；引入具有多级隔离层的即插即用适配器模块动态生成目标视图的参考特征；设计解耦三重注意力机制有效对齐和整合多分支特征。

Result: 大量实验表明，UniView显著提升了新视角合成性能，在具有挑战性的数据集上优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: 通过利用相似物体的参考图像提供强先验信息，结合多模态大语言模型和创新的注意力机制，UniView有效解决了单图像新视角合成中的失真问题，取得了优异的性能。

Abstract: The task of synthesizing novel views from a single image is highly ill-posed
due to multiple explanations for unobserved areas. Most current methods tend to
generate unseen regions from ambiguity priors and interpolation near input
views, which often lead to severe distortions. To address this limitation, we
propose a novel model dubbed as UniView, which can leverage reference images
from a similar object to provide strong prior information during view
synthesis. More specifically, we construct a retrieval and augmentation system
and employ a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to assist in selecting
reference images that meet our requirements. Additionally, a plug-and-play
adapter module with multi-level isolation layers is introduced to dynamically
generate reference features for the target views. Moreover, in order to
preserve the details of an original input image, we design a decoupled triple
attention mechanism, which can effectively align and integrate multi-branch
features into the synthesis process. Extensive experiments have demonstrated
that our UniView significantly improves novel view synthesis performance and
outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the challenging datasets.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频到音频生成方法训练成本高，需要利用基础模型的跨模态知识转移能力。先前工作使用轻量级映射器连接预训练视觉编码器和文本到音频模型，但仍有改进空间。

Method: 提出多基础模型映射器(MFM-Mapper)：1) 融合双视觉编码器的特征以获得更丰富的语义和时间信息；2) 用GPT-2替代线性映射器，将跨模态特征映射视为自回归翻译任务来改善特征对齐。

Result: MFM-Mapper展现出卓越的训练效率，仅需之前映射器方法16%的训练规模，在语义和时间一致性方面表现更好，且与更大规模训练的模型性能相当。

Conclusion: 通过双视觉编码器特征融合和GPT-2映射器的创新设计，MFM-Mapper在显著减少训练成本的同时，提升了视频到音频生成的性能，证明了多基础模型融合的有效性。

Abstract: Recent Video-to-Audio (V2A) generation relies on extracting semantic and
temporal features from video to condition generative models. Training these
models from scratch is resource intensive. Consequently, leveraging foundation
models (FMs) has gained traction due to their cross-modal knowledge transfer
and generalization capabilities. One prior work has explored fine-tuning a
lightweight mapper network to connect a pre-trained visual encoder with a
text-to-audio generation model for V2A. Inspired by this, we introduce the
Multiple Foundation Model Mapper (MFM-Mapper). Compared to the previous mapper
approach, MFM-Mapper benefits from richer semantic and temporal information by
fusing features from dual visual encoders. Furthermore, by replacing a linear
mapper with GPT-2, MFM-Mapper improves feature alignment, drawing parallels
between cross-modal features mapping and autoregressive translation tasks. Our
MFM-Mapper exhibits remarkable training efficiency. It achieves better
performance in semantic and temporal consistency with fewer training consuming,
requiring only 16\% of the training scale compared to previous mapper-based
work, yet achieves competitive performance with models trained on a much larger
scale.

Method: 设计引导频域模态特定提取(GFMSE)模块进行频域退化感知和抑制，以及引导空域模态聚合融合(GSMAF)模块进行跨模态退化滤波和自适应多源特征聚合

Result: 大量定性和定量实验表明，GD^2Fusion在双源退化场景下相比现有算法和策略实现了更优的融合性能

Conclusion: 该方法通过视觉语言模型与双域联合优化的协同整合，有效解决了双源退化图像融合问题，代码将在论文接受后公开

Abstract: Most existing infrared-visible image fusion (IVIF) methods assume
high-quality inputs, and therefore struggle to handle dual-source degraded
scenarios, typically requiring manual selection and sequential application of
multiple pre-enhancement steps. This decoupled pre-enhancement-to-fusion
pipeline inevitably leads to error accumulation and performance degradation. To
overcome these limitations, we propose Guided Dual-Domain Fusion (GD^2Fusion),
a novel framework that synergistically integrates vision-language models (VLMs)
for degradation perception with dual-domain (frequency/spatial) joint
optimization. Concretely, the designed Guided Frequency Modality-Specific
Extraction (GFMSE) module performs frequency-domain degradation perception and
suppression and discriminatively extracts fusion-relevant sub-band features.
Meanwhile, the Guided Spatial Modality-Aggregated Fusion (GSMAF) module carries
out cross-modal degradation filtering and adaptive multi-source feature
aggregation in the spatial domain to enhance modality complementarity and
structural consistency. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments
demonstrate that GD^2Fusion achieves superior fusion performance compared with
existing algorithms and strategies in dual-source degraded scenarios. The code
will be publicly released after acceptance of this paper.

Abstract: Breast cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality among women
worldwide. Ultrasound imaging, widely used due to its safety and
cost-effectiveness, plays a key role in early detection, especially in patients
with dense breast tissue. This paper presents a comprehensive study on the
application of machine learning and deep learning techniques for breast cancer
classification using ultrasound images. Using datasets such as BUSI, BUS-BRA,

KNN) and deep convolutional neural networks (ResNet-18, EfficientNet-B0,
GoogLeNet). Experimental results show that ResNet-18 achieves the highest

models, though outperformed by CNNs, achieve competitive performance when
enhanced with deep feature extraction. Grad-CAM visualizations further improve
model transparency by highlighting diagnostically relevant image regions. These
findings support the integration of AI-based diagnostic tools into clinical
workflows and demonstrate the feasibility of deploying high-performing,

Conclusion: SLVM模型通过生物启发设计有效提升了低光照条件下的感知性能，Dark-traffic数据集填补了该领域基准数据的空白。

Abstract: Fast and accurate object perception in low-light traffic scenes has attracted
increasing attention. However, due to severe illumination degradation and the
lack of reliable visual cues, existing perception models and methods struggle
to quickly adapt to and accurately predict in low-light environments. Moreover,
there is the absence of available large-scale benchmark specifically focused on
low-light traffic scenes. To bridge this gap, we introduce a physically
grounded illumination degradation method tailored to real-world low-light
settings and construct Dark-traffic, the largest densely annotated dataset to
date for low-light traffic scenes, supporting object detection, instance
segmentation, and optical flow estimation. We further propose the Separable
Learning Vision Model (SLVM), a biologically inspired framework designed to
enhance perception under adverse lighting. SLVM integrates four key components:
a light-adaptive pupillary mechanism for illumination-sensitive feature
extraction, a feature-level separable learning strategy for efficient
representation, task-specific decoupled branches for multi-task separable
learning, and a spatial misalignment-aware fusion module for precise
multi-feature alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SLVM achieves
state-of-the-art performance with reduced computational overhead. Notably, it
outperforms RT-DETR by 11.2 percentage points in detection, YOLOv12 by 6.1
percentage points in instance segmentation, and reduces endpoint error (EPE) of
baseline by 12.37% on Dark-traffic. On the LIS benchmark, the end-to-end
trained SLVM surpasses Swin Transformer+EnlightenGAN and
ConvNeXt-T+EnlightenGAN by an average of 11 percentage points across key
metrics, and exceeds Mask RCNN (with light enhancement) by 3.1 percentage
points. The Dark-traffic dataset and complete code is released at

achieving superior accuracy, robustness, and efficiency, with ShuffleNet
excelling in generalization, particularly under full fine-tuning. The IFHCDB
dataset yielded the highest results, with 99% accuracy using MnasNet under full

AHCD dataset achieved competitive accuracy (97%) with ShuffleNet, while HIJJA
posed significant challenges due to its variability, achieving a peak accuracy
of 92% with ShuffleNet. Notably, full fine-tuning demonstrated the best overall
performance, balancing accuracy and convergence speed, while partial

Method: 使用SMPL作为代理表示，将服装-身体匹配问题分解为两个对应任务：1）基于几何学习的服装-SMPL对应，2）基于扩散模型的身体-SMPL对应，利用多视角一致外观特征和预训练2D基础模型。

Result: 系统能够处理复杂几何、非流形网格，泛化到各种人形角色（人类、机器人、卡通角色、生物和外星人），保持计算效率，无需2D服装缝制图案即可生成高质量3D服装试穿效果。

Conclusion: LUIVITON提供了一个完全自动化的虚拟试穿解决方案，支持服装尺寸和材质的快速定制，为实际应用提供了高效且通用的方法。

Abstract: We present LUIVITON, an end-to-end system for fully automated virtual try-on,
capable of draping complex, multi-layer clothing onto diverse and arbitrarily
posed humanoid characters. To address the challenge of aligning complex
garments with arbitrary and highly diverse body shapes, we use SMPL as a proxy
representation and separate the clothing-to-body draping problem into two
correspondence tasks: 1) clothing-to-SMPL and 2) body-to-SMPL correspondence,
where each has its unique challenges. While we address the clothing-to-SMPL
fitting problem using a geometric learning-based approach for
partial-to-complete shape correspondence prediction, we introduce a diffusion
model-based approach for body-to-SMPL correspondence using multi-view
consistent appearance features and a pre-trained 2D foundation model. Our
method can handle complex geometries, non-manifold meshes, and generalizes
effectively to a wide range of humanoid characters -- including humans, robots,
cartoon subjects, creatures, and aliens, while maintaining computational
efficiency for practical adoption. In addition to offering a fully automatic
fitting solution, LUIVITON supports fast customization of clothing size,
allowing users to adjust clothing sizes and material properties after they have
been draped. We show that our system can produce high-quality 3D clothing
fittings without any human labor, even when 2D clothing sewing patterns are not
available.

TL;DR: ADClick是一个用于工业异常检测的交互式图像分割算法，只需少量用户点击和简短文本描述即可生成像素级异常标注，显著提升异常检测模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业产品检测通常仅使用正常样本训练异常检测模型，虽然有缺陷样本可用但需要像素级标注，限制了可扩展性。

Method: 提出ADClick交互式图像分割算法，通过用户点击和文本描述生成像素级标注；进一步开发ADClick-Seg跨模态框架，通过基于原型的方法对齐视觉特征和文本提示。

Result: ADClick在MVTec AD上达到AP=96.1%；ADClick-Seg在多类异常检测任务上达到AP=80.0%、PRO=97.5%、Pixel-AUROC=99.1%的SOTA结果。

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合像素级先验和语言引导线索，实现了精确高效的异常标注和检测，解决了工业异常检测中标注成本高的问题。

Abstract: Industrial product inspection is often performed using Anomaly Detection (AD)
frameworks trained solely on non-defective samples. Although defective samples
can be collected during production, leveraging them usually requires
pixel-level annotations, limiting scalability. To address this, we propose
ADClick, an Interactive Image Segmentation (IIS) algorithm for industrial
anomaly detection. ADClick generates pixel-wise anomaly annotations from only a
few user clicks and a brief textual description, enabling precise and efficient
labeling that significantly improves AD model performance (e.g., AP = 96.1\% on
MVTec AD). We further introduce ADClick-Seg, a cross-modal framework that
aligns visual features and textual prompts via a prototype-based approach for
anomaly detection and localization. By combining pixel-level priors with
language-guided cues, ADClick-Seg achieves state-of-the-art results on the
challenging ``Multi-class'' AD task (AP = 80.0\%, PRO = 97.5\%, Pixel-AUROC =
99.1\% on MVTec AD).

Abstract: Background: To systematically review and perform a meta-analysis of
artificial intelligence (AI)-driven methods for detecting and correcting
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) motion artifacts, assessing current
developments, effectiveness, challenges, and future research directions.
Methods: A comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted,
focusing on deep learning (DL) approaches, particularly generative models, for
the detection and correction of MRI motion artifacts. Quantitative data were
extracted regarding utilized datasets, DL architectures, and performance
metrics. Results: DL, particularly generative models, show promise for reducing
motion artifacts and improving image quality; however, limited
generalizability, reliance on paired training data, and risk of visual
distortions remain key challenges that motivate standardized datasets and
reporting. Conclusions: AI-driven methods, particularly DL generative models,
show significant potential for improving MRI image quality by effectively
addressing motion artifacts. However, critical challenges must be addressed,
including the need for comprehensive public datasets, standardized reporting
protocols for artifact levels, and more advanced, adaptable DL techniques to
reduce reliance on extensive paired datasets. Addressing these aspects could
substantially enhance MRI diagnostic accuracy, reduce healthcare costs, and
improve patient care outcomes.

<details>

Motivation: 现有方法主要使用低阶几何先验（如法向量），且通过噪声敏感方法估计不可靠，需要更鲁棒的几何约束优化

Method: 提出基于主曲率初始化高斯尺度，引入高效噪声鲁棒的几何结构估计方法，提供动态几何先验来优化训练流程

Result: 在多个数据集的新视角合成任务中，GeoSplat显著提升高斯溅射性能，超越先前基线方法

Conclusion: 高阶几何先验和鲁棒估计方法能有效改进高斯溅射优化，GeoSplat框架为3D重建提供了更可靠的几何约束方案

Abstract: A few recent works explored incorporating geometric priors to regularize the
optimization of Gaussian splatting, further improving its performance. However,
those early studies mainly focused on the use of low-order geometric priors
(e.g., normal vector), and they are also unreliably estimated by
noise-sensitive methods, like local principal component analysis. To address
their limitations, we first present GeoSplat, a general geometry-constrained
optimization framework that exploits both first-order and second-order
geometric quantities to improve the entire training pipeline of Gaussian
splatting, including Gaussian initialization, gradient update, and
densification. As an example, we initialize the scales of 3D Gaussian
primitives in terms of principal curvatures, leading to a better coverage of
the object surface than random initialization. Secondly, based on certain
geometric structures (e.g., local manifold), we introduce efficient and
noise-robust estimation methods that provide dynamic geometric priors for our
framework. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple datasets for novel view
synthesis, showing that our framework: GeoSplat, significantly improves the
performance of Gaussian splatting and outperforms previous baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决CNN在处理固定粒度信息时忽视不同粒度特征间关联性的问题，这对面部美观度预测这种需要考虑全局和局部特征复杂交互的任务很重要

Method: 提出Scale-Interaction Transformer (SIT)混合深度学习架构：首先使用并行卷积的多粒度模块提取不同感受野的面部特征，然后将多粒度表征构造为序列并通过Transformer编码器的自注意力机制显式模型其间相互作用

Result: 在SCUT-FBP5500数据集上达到0.9187的Pearson相关系数，超过之前方法，创造了新的最高水平

Conclusion: 显式模型多粒度视觉线索间的相互作用对高性能FBP至关重要，SIT架构显示了混合CNN-Transformer模型在需要全局上下文感知的复杂图像回归任务中的潜力

Abstract: Automated Facial Beauty Prediction (FBP) is a challenging computer vision
task due to the complex interplay of local and global facial features that
influence human perception. While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) excel at
feature extraction, they often process information at a fixed scale,
potentially overlooking the critical inter-dependencies between features at
different levels of granularity. To address this limitation, we introduce the
Scale-Interaction Transformer (SIT), a novel hybrid deep learning architecture
that synergizes the feature extraction power of CNNs with the relational
modeling capabilities of Transformers. The SIT first employs a multi-scale
module with parallel convolutions to capture facial characteristics at varying
receptive fields. These multi-scale representations are then framed as a
sequence and processed by a Transformer encoder, which explicitly models their
interactions and contextual relationships via a self-attention mechanism. We
conduct extensive experiments on the widely-used SCUT-FBP5500 benchmark
dataset, where the proposed SIT model establishes a new state-of-the-art. It
achieves a Pearson Correlation of 0.9187, outperforming previous methods. Our
findings demonstrate that explicitly modeling the interplay between multi-scale
visual cues is crucial for high-performance FBP. The success of the SIT
architecture highlights the potential of hybrid CNN-Transformer models for
complex image regression tasks that demand a holistic, context-aware
understanding.

TL;DR: 使用稀疏混合专家(MoE)层替代CNN中的残差块或卷积层，在不增加推理成本的情况下提升模型对抗攻击的鲁棒性，特别是在结合对抗训练时效果显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CNN对抗攻击的鲁棒性提升方法通常需要大量资源，本文探索通过稀疏MoE层来增加模型容量而不增加推理成本，从而提高鲁棒性。

Method: 在ResNet架构的深层阶段插入单个MoE层，结合对抗训练，使用CIFAR-100数据集进行实验，分析switch loss对专家路由的影响。

Result: 在PGD和AutoPGD攻击下，插入MoE层能持续提升鲁棒性；switch loss会导致路由集中在少数专家上，使这些路径通过对抗训练变得更加鲁棒，部分单个专家的鲁棒性甚至超过门控MoE模型。

Conclusion: 稀疏MoE层能有效提升CNN对抗攻击的鲁棒性，鲁棒子路径通过专家专业化出现，为对抗鲁棒性研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Robustifying convolutional neural networks (CNNs) against adversarial attacks
remains challenging and often requires resource-intensive countermeasures. We
explore the use of sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) layers to improve robustness
by replacing selected residual blocks or convolutional layers, thereby
increasing model capacity without additional inference cost. On ResNet
architectures trained on CIFAR-100, we find that inserting a single MoE layer
in the deeper stages leads to consistent improvements in robustness under PGD
and AutoPGD attacks when combined with adversarial training. Furthermore, we
discover that when switch loss is used for balancing, it causes routing to
collapse onto a small set of overused experts, thereby concentrating
adversarial training on these paths and inadvertently making them more robust.
As a result, some individual experts outperform the gated MoE model in
robustness, suggesting that robust subpaths emerge through specialization. Our
code is available at https://github.com/KASTEL-MobilityLab/robust-sparse-moes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现实应用中源模型无法泛化到域偏移目标数据的问题，特别是在源数据因隐私或成本无法共享、目标标签稀缺的回归任务场景

Method: 基于Contradistinguisher框架，开发了CRAFT方法，用于源数据不可用的半监督回归迁移，不依赖中间表示对齐

Result: 在EEG凝视预测和MRI脑龄预测中，RMSE提升达9%；比现有源无关域适应方法性能提升超过3%

Conclusion: CRAFT是生物学和医学中普遍存在的源无关半监督深度回归迁移的高效方法

Abstract: Deep learning models deployed in real-world applications (e.g., medicine)
face challenges because source models do not generalize well to domain-shifted
target data. Many successful domain adaptation (DA) approaches require full
access to source data. Yet, such requirements are unrealistic in scenarios
where source data cannot be shared either because of privacy concerns or
because it is too large and incurs prohibitive storage or computational costs.
Moreover, resource constraints may limit the availability of labeled targets.
We illustrate this challenge in a neuroscience setting where source data are
unavailable, labeled target data are meager, and predictions involve
continuous-valued outputs. We build upon Contradistinguisher (CUDA), an
efficient framework that learns a shared model across the labeled source and
unlabeled target samples, without intermediate representation alignment. Yet,
CUDA was designed for unsupervised DA, with full access to source data, and for
classification tasks. We develop CRAFT -- a Contradistinguisher-based
Regularization Approach for Flexible Training -- for source-free (SF),
semi-supervised transfer of pretrained models in regression tasks. We showcase
the efficacy of CRAFT in two neuroscience settings: gaze prediction with
electroencephalography (EEG) data and ``brain age'' prediction with structural
MRI data. For both datasets, CRAFT yielded up to 9% improvement in
root-mean-squared error (RMSE) over fine-tuned models when labeled training
examples were scarce. Moreover, CRAFT leveraged unlabeled target data and
outperformed four competing state-of-the-art source-free domain adaptation
models by more than 3%. Lastly, we demonstrate the efficacy of CRAFT on two
other real-world regression benchmarks. We propose CRAFT as an efficient
approach for source-free, semi-supervised deep transfer for regression that is
ubiquitous in biology and medicine.

Conclusion: 该方法为可扩展、高质量和可控的3D内容创建提供了实用的解决方案，显著提升了素材生成的效率和质量。

Abstract: High-quality textures are critical for realistic 3D content creation, yet
existing generative methods are slow, rely on UV maps, and often fail to remain
faithful to a reference image. To address these challenges, we propose a
transformer-based framework that predicts a 3D texture field directly from a
single image and a mesh, eliminating the need for UV mapping and differentiable
rendering, and enabling faster texture generation. Our method integrates a
triplane representation with depth-based backprojection losses, enabling
efficient training and faster inference. Once trained, it generates
high-fidelity textures in a single forward pass, requiring only 0.2s per shape.
Extensive qualitative, quantitative, and user preference evaluations
demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on
single-image texture reconstruction in terms of both fidelity to the input
image and perceptual quality, highlighting its practicality for scalable,
high-quality, and controllable 3D content creation.

Motivation: 现有的基于2D到3D提升的3D实例分割方法由于提升过程中的累积误差、模糊语义引导和深度约束不足，难以产生精确的实例级分割

Method: 提出"分割-生长"框架：首先使用几何基元净化和分割模糊的提升掩码，然后在场景中将其生长为完整实例。包括基于3D几何基元共现的掩码过滤策略和利用空间连续性及高级特征的几何细化

Result: 在ScanNet200、ScanNet++和KITTI-360数据集上的实验表明，SGS-3D显著提高了分割精度和对预训练模型不准确掩码的鲁棒性，在室内外环境中都保持了强大的泛化能力

Conclusion: SGS-3D通过联合融合语义和几何信息，实现了高保真度的3D实例分割，为3D视觉领域的高质量场景理解提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Accurate 3D instance segmentation is crucial for high-quality scene
understanding in the 3D vision domain. However, 3D instance segmentation based
on 2D-to-3D lifting approaches struggle to produce precise instance-level
segmentation, due to accumulated errors introduced during the lifting process
from ambiguous semantic guidance and insufficient depth constraints. To tackle
these challenges, we propose splitting and growing reliable semantic mask for
high-fidelity 3D instance segmentation (SGS-3D), a novel "split-then-grow"
framework that first purifies and splits ambiguous lifted masks using geometric
primitives, and then grows them into complete instances within the scene.
Unlike existing approaches that directly rely on raw lifted masks and sacrifice
segmentation accuracy, SGS-3D serves as a training-free refinement method that
jointly fuses semantic and geometric information, enabling effective
cooperation between the two levels of representation. Specifically, for
semantic guidance, we introduce a mask filtering strategy that leverages the
co-occurrence of 3D geometry primitives to identify and remove ambiguous masks,
thereby ensuring more reliable semantic consistency with the 3D object
instances. For the geometric refinement, we construct fine-grained object
instances by exploiting both spatial continuity and high-level features,
particularly in the case of semantic ambiguity between distinct objects.
Experimental results on ScanNet200, ScanNet++, and KITTI-360 demonstrate that
SGS-3D substantially improves segmentation accuracy and robustness against
inaccurate masks from pre-trained models, yielding high-fidelity object
instances while maintaining strong generalization across diverse indoor and
outdoor environments. Code is available in the supplementary materials.

Motivation: 手语识别面临标注数据稀缺问题，对比学习方法虽然有效但存在两个主要问题：1) 对所有视频区域同等对待，忽视关键信息区域的重要性；2) 不同手语间的共享动作导致负样本高度相似，增加识别难度。

Method: 提出包含两个关键组件的自监督学习框架：1) 自由负样本对的自监督方法；2) 新的数据增强技术。两者协同工作以学习更具判别性的特征表示。

Result: 在线性评估、半监督学习和跨手语迁移性任务中，该方法相比多种对比学习和自监督方法都显示出显著的准确率提升。

Conclusion: 该自监督学习框架有效解决了手语识别中的关键挑战，通过学习更具判别性的特征表示，在手语识别任务中取得了优异性能。

Abstract: Sign language recognition (SLR) is a machine learning task aiming to identify
signs in videos. Due to the scarcity of annotated data, unsupervised methods
like contrastive learning have become promising in this field. They learn
meaningful representations by pulling positive pairs (two augmented versions of
the same instance) closer and pushing negative pairs (different from the
positive pairs) apart. In SLR, in a sign video, only certain parts provide
information that is truly useful for its recognition. Applying contrastive
methods to SLR raises two issues: (i) contrastive learning methods treat all
parts of a video in the same way, without taking into account the relevance of
certain parts over others; (ii) shared movements between different signs make
negative pairs highly similar, complicating sign discrimination. These issues
lead to learning non-discriminative features for sign recognition and poor
results in downstream tasks. In response, this paper proposes a self-supervised
learning framework designed to learn meaningful representations for SLR. This
framework consists of two key components designed to work together: (i) a new
self-supervised approach with free-negative pairs; (ii) a new data augmentation
technique. This approach shows a considerable gain in accuracy compared to
several contrastive and self-supervised methods, across linear evaluation,
semi-supervised learning, and transferability between sign languages.

Motivation: 虽然大语言模型在程序综合方面表现优异，但其生成能够渲染准确视觉内容的符号图形程序的能力仍然未充分探索。这个任务也可以作为观察LLMs如何理解视觉世界的视角。

Method: 提出了一种基于强化学习的方法，包含格式有效性检查和跨模态奖励机制。使用SigLIP进行文本-图像对齐，DINO进行图像-图像对齐，确保生成的SVG程序可渲染且与文本描述保持一致。

Result: 在SGP-GenBench测试集上，前沿专有模型显著超过开源模型。应用于Qwen-2.5-7B模型后，该方法显著提升了SVG生成质量和语义对齐，达到了与前沿系统相当的性能。

Conclusion: 符号图形编程为跨模态基础提供了一个精确且可解释的视角。RL训练导致了对象的更细粒度分解和改善场景一致性的上下文细节。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at program synthesis, yet their ability to
produce symbolic graphics programs (SGPs) that render into precise visual
content remains underexplored. We study symbolic graphics programming, where
the goal is to generate an SGP from a natural-language description. This task
also serves as a lens into how LLMs understand the visual world by prompting
them to generate images rendered from SGPs. Among various SGPs, our paper
sticks to scalable vector graphics (SVGs). We begin by examining the extent to
which LLMs can generate SGPs. To this end, we introduce SGP-GenBench, a
comprehensive benchmark covering object fidelity, scene fidelity, and
compositionality (attribute binding, spatial relations, numeracy). On
SGP-GenBench, we discover that frontier proprietary models substantially
outperform open-source models, and performance correlates well with general
coding capabilities. Motivated by this gap, we aim to improve LLMs' ability to
generate SGPs. We propose a reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rewards
approach, where a format-validity gate ensures renderable SVG, and a
cross-modal reward aligns text and the rendered image via strong vision
encoders (e.g., SigLIP for text-image and DINO for image-image). Applied to
Qwen-2.5-7B, our method substantially improves SVG generation quality and
semantics, achieving performance on par with frontier systems. We further
analyze training dynamics, showing that RL induces (i) finer decomposition of
objects into controllable primitives and (ii) contextual details that improve
scene coherence. Our results demonstrate that symbolic graphics programming
offers a precise and interpretable lens on cross-modal grounding.

interoperable transformations, along with extensive control over grid
parametrization and object properties. This flexibility enables the creation of
millions of unique task rules -- surpassing concurrent datasets by several
orders of magnitude -- across a wide range of difficulties, while allowing
virtually unlimited sample generation per rule. We provide baseline experiments
using state-of-the-art vision models, highlighting their consistent failures to
generalize to novel combinations of familiar elements, despite strong in-domain
performance. COGITAO is fully open-sourced, including all code and datasets, to

### [53] [Narrative-to-Scene Generation: An LLM-Driven Pipeline for 2D Game Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04481)
*Yi-Chun Chen,Arnav Jhala*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种轻量级流水线，能够将短文本故事提示转换为可玩的2D结构化游戏场景序列，解决故事文本与视觉环境连接的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型在故事生成方面取得了进步，但将史述性文本与可玩视觉环境相连接仍是程序内容生成领域的开放性挑战。

Method: 系统通过识别三个关键时间框架，提取"对象-关系-对象"三元组的空间谓词，使用GameTileNet数据集的支持力语义嵌入获取视觉资产，用细胞自动机生成层状地形，并基于谓词结构空间规则置放对象。

Result: 在十个多样化故事中评估系统，分析了地碘-对象匹配、支持力-层对齐和空间约束满足情况。

Conclusion: 这个原型系统提供了可扩展的故事驱动场景生成方法，为多帧连续性、符号跟踪和多代理协调在故事中心PCG中的未来工作奠定了基础。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models(LLMs) enable compelling story
generation, but connecting narrative text to playable visual environments
remains an open challenge in procedural content generation(PCG). We present a
lightweight pipeline that transforms short narrative prompts into a sequence of
2D tile-based game scenes, reflecting the temporal structure of stories. Given
an LLM-generated narrative, our system identifies three key time frames,
extracts spatial predicates in the form of "Object-Relation-Object" triples,
and retrieves visual assets using affordance-aware semantic embeddings from the
GameTileNet dataset. A layered terrain is generated using Cellular Automata,
and objects are placed using spatial rules grounded in the predicate structure.
We evaluated our system in ten diverse stories, analyzing tile-object matching,
affordance-layer alignment, and spatial constraint satisfaction across frames.
This prototype offers a scalable approach to narrative-driven scene generation
and lays the foundation for future work on multi-frame continuity, symbolic
tracking, and multi-agent coordination in story-centered PCG.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合物理模型相位恢复与文本引导扩散模型的即插即用框架，用于消除叠层衍射成像中的伪影，通过ADMM算法确保数据保真度与伪影去除的共识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 叠层衍射相位恢复技术虽然能实现高分辨率成像，但经常受到网格病理和多层串扰等伪影的影响，导致重建图像质量下降。

Method: 采用交替方向乘子法(ADMM)将物理模型相位恢复与文本引导扩散图像编辑(LEDITS++)相结合，用户可以通过自然语言指定需要去除的伪影类型。

Result: 在模拟和实验数据集上验证了该方法在伪影抑制和结构保真度方面的显著改进，PSNR和衍射图案一致性等指标均有提升。

Conclusion: 文本引导生成模型与基于模型的相位恢复算法相结合，为高质量衍射成像提供了一种可迁移且保真度高的方法。

Abstract: Ptychographic phase retrieval enables high-resolution imaging of complex
samples but often suffers from artifacts such as grid pathology and multislice
crosstalk, which degrade reconstructed images. We propose a plug-and-play (PnP)
framework that integrates physics model-based phase retrieval with text-guided
image editing using foundational diffusion models. By employing the alternating
direction method of multipliers (ADMM), our approach ensures consensus between
data fidelity and artifact removal subproblems, maintaining physics consistency
while enhancing image quality. Artifact removal is achieved using a text-guided
diffusion image editing method (LEDITS++) with a pre-trained foundational
diffusion model, allowing users to specify artifacts for removal in natural
language. Demonstrations on simulated and experimental datasets show
significant improvements in artifact suppression and structural fidelity,
validated by metrics such as peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and diffraction
pattern consistency. This work highlights the combination of text-guided
generative models and model-based phase retrieval algorithms as a transferable
and fidelity-preserving method for high-quality diffraction imaging.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 提出了一种改进的文本驱动3D场景风格化方法，通过参考注意力机制、多深度图增强视角一致性，以及多区域风格控制，显著提升了3D风格化的质量和视角一致性。

Motivation: 现有文本驱动3D场景编辑和风格化方法在保证高质量风格化和视角一致性方面仍存在挑战，特别是在不同区域或对象上实现语义对应的风格一致性方面。

Method: 1) 扩展风格对齐的深度条件视角生成框架，用单参考注意力共享机制替代完全共享注意力机制；2) 使用多深度图网格作为单图像参考增强视角一致性；3) 提出多区域重要性加权切片Wasserstein距离损失，支持基于分割掩码的区域化风格控制。

Result: 实验评估表明，该管道有效提升了文本驱动3D风格化的结果，在定性和定量评估中都表现出色。

Conclusion: 该方法通过创新的注意力机制、深度图增强和区域化风格控制，成功解决了3D风格化中的视角一致性和区域风格一致性问题，为高质量的3D场景风格化提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-driven 3D scene editing and stylization, which
leverage the powerful capabilities of 2D generative models, have demonstrated
promising outcomes. However, challenges remain in ensuring high-quality
stylization and view consistency simultaneously. Moreover, applying style
consistently to different regions or objects in the scene with semantic
correspondence is a challenging task. To address these limitations, we
introduce techniques that enhance the quality of 3D stylization while
maintaining view consistency and providing optional region-controlled style
transfer. Our method achieves stylization by re-training an initial 3D
representation using stylized multi-view 2D images of the source views.
Therefore, ensuring both style consistency and view consistency of stylized
multi-view images is crucial. We achieve this by extending the style-aligned
depth-conditioned view generation framework, replacing the fully shared
attention mechanism with a single reference-based attention-sharing mechanism,
which effectively aligns style across different viewpoints. Additionally,
inspired by recent 3D inpainting methods, we utilize a grid of multiple depth
maps as a single-image reference to further strengthen view consistency among
stylized images. Finally, we propose Multi-Region Importance-Weighted Sliced
Wasserstein Distance Loss, allowing styles to be applied to distinct image
regions using segmentation masks from off-the-shelf models. We demonstrate that
this optional feature enhances the faithfulness of style transfer and enables
the mixing of different styles across distinct regions of the scene.
Experimental evaluations, both qualitative and quantitative, demonstrate that
our pipeline effectively improves the results of text-driven 3D stylization.

*Minjong Yoo,Woo Kyung Kim,Honguk Woo*

TL;DR: 提出了ICPAD框架，使用扩散技能学习技术实现跨域快速策略适应，在有限目标域数据和无模型更新的约束下表现优异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长时程多任务环境中跨域策略适应的挑战，特别是在目标域数据有限且不允许模型更新的严格约束下

Method: 采用跨域技能扩散方案，学习域无关原型技能和域接地技能适配器，通过动态域提示方案增强上下文适应性能

Result: 在Metaworld机器人操作和CARLA自动驾驶实验中，在各种跨域配置下（环境动态、智能体体现、任务时程差异）都取得了优异的策略适应性能

Conclusion: ICPAD框架通过扩散技能学习和动态提示机制，有效解决了跨域策略适应问题，在严格约束条件下表现出色

Abstract: In this work, we present an in-context policy adaptation (ICPAD) framework
designed for long-horizon multi-task environments, exploring diffusion-based
skill learning techniques in cross-domain settings. The framework enables rapid
adaptation of skill-based reinforcement learning policies to diverse target
domains, especially under stringent constraints on no model updates and only
limited target domain data. Specifically, the framework employs a cross-domain
skill diffusion scheme, where domain-agnostic prototype skills and a
domain-grounded skill adapter are learned jointly and effectively from an
offline dataset through cross-domain consistent diffusion processes. The
prototype skills act as primitives for common behavior representations of
long-horizon policies, serving as a lingua franca to bridge different domains.
Furthermore, to enhance the in-context adaptation performance, we develop a
dynamic domain prompting scheme that guides the diffusion-based skill adapter
toward better alignment with the target domain. Through experiments with
robotic manipulation in Metaworld and autonomous driving in CARLA, we show that
our $\oursol$ framework achieves superior policy adaptation performance under
limited target domain data conditions for various cross-domain configurations
including differences in environment dynamics, agent embodiment, and task
horizon.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 使用仅100个专家演示（相当于6300次环境交互），基于Transformer的动作分块方法（ACT）在航天器制导、导航和控制任务中实现了高性能，比使用4000万次交互的元强化学习方法表现更好。

Abstract: We present an imitation learning approach for spacecraft guidance,
navigation, and control(GNC) that achieves high performance from limited data.
Using only 100 expert demonstrations, equivalent to 6,300 environment
interactions, our method, which implements Action Chunking with Transformers
(ACT), learns a control policy that maps visual and state observations to
thrust and torque commands. ACT generates smoother, more consistent
trajectories than a meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) baseline trained with
40 million interactions. We evaluate ACT on a rendezvous task: in-orbit docking
with the International Space Station (ISS). We show that our approach achieves
greater accuracy, smoother control, and greater sample efficiency.

Conclusion: 基于搜索的规划方法对于长时程机器人操作任务至关重要，SPOT通过结合学习模型和搜索策略有效解决了连续动作空间中的规划问题

Abstract: Long-horizon planning for robot manipulation is a challenging problem that
requires reasoning about the effects of a sequence of actions on a physical 3D
scene. While traditional task planning methods are shown to be effective for
long-horizon manipulation, they require discretizing the continuous state and
action space into symbolic descriptions of objects, object relationships, and
actions. Instead, we propose a hybrid learning-and-planning approach that
leverages learned models as domain-specific priors to guide search in
high-dimensional continuous action spaces. We introduce SPOT: Search over Point
cloud Object Transformations, which plans by searching for a sequence of
transformations from an initial scene point cloud to a goal-satisfying point
cloud. SPOT samples candidate actions from learned suggesters that operate on
partially observed point clouds, eliminating the need to discretize actions or
object relationships. We evaluate SPOT on multi-object rearrangement tasks,
reporting task planning success and task execution success in both simulation
and real-world environments. Our experiments show that SPOT generates
successful plans and outperforms a policy-learning approach. We also perform
ablations that highlight the importance of search-based planning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升机器人触觉感知能力，通过多模态融合改善表面材料分类性能，为机器人操作和交互提供更好的感知支持。

Method: 基于Surformer v1框架改进，采用决策级融合机制：视觉分支使用CNN分类器(Efficient V-Net)，触觉分支使用编码器transformer模型，通过可学习的加权和组合输出logits进行融合。

Result: 在Touch and Go多模态基准数据集上表现良好，保持竞争力的推理速度，适合实时机器人应用。

Conclusion: 决策级融合和基于transformer的触觉建模能有效增强多模态机器人感知中的表面理解能力。

Abstract: Multimodal surface material classification plays a critical role in advancing
tactile perception for robotic manipulation and interaction. In this paper, we
present Surformer v2, an enhanced multi-modal classification architecture
designed to integrate visual and tactile sensory streams through a
late(decision level) fusion mechanism. Building on our earlier Surformer v1
framework [1], which employed handcrafted feature extraction followed by
mid-level fusion architecture with multi-head cross-attention layers, Surformer
v2 integrates the feature extraction process within the model itself and shifts
to late fusion. The vision branch leverages a CNN-based classifier(Efficient
V-Net), while the tactile branch employs an encoder-only transformer model,
allowing each modality to extract modality-specific features optimized for
classification. Rather than merging feature maps, the model performs
decision-level fusion by combining the output logits using a learnable weighted
sum, enabling adaptive emphasis on each modality depending on data context and
training dynamics. We evaluate Surformer v2 on the Touch and Go dataset [2], a
multi-modal benchmark comprising surface images and corresponding tactile
sensor readings. Our results demonstrate that Surformer v2 performs well,
maintaining competitive inference speed, suitable for real-time robotic
applications. These findings underscore the effectiveness of decision-level
fusion and transformer-based tactile modeling for enhancing surface
understanding in multi-modal robotic perception.

Abstract: Automated vehicle control using reinforcement learning (RL) has attracted
significant attention due to its potential to learn driving policies through
environment interaction. However, RL agents often face training challenges in
sample efficiency and effective exploration, making it difficult to discover an
optimal driving strategy. To address these issues, we propose guiding the RL
driving agent with a demonstration policy that need not be a highly optimized
or expert-level controller. Specifically, we integrate a rule-based lane change
controller with the Soft Actor Critic (SAC) algorithm to enhance exploration
and learning efficiency. Our approach demonstrates improved driving performance
and can be extended to other driving scenarios that can similarly benefit from
demonstration-based guidance.

Abstract: As humanoid robots enter real-world environments, ensuring robust locomotion
across diverse environments is crucial. This paper presents a computationally
efficient hierarchical control framework for humanoid robot locomotion based on
reduced-order models -- enabling versatile step planning and incorporating arm
and torso dynamics to better stabilize the walking. At the high level, we use
the step-to-step dynamics of the ALIP model to simultaneously optimize over
step periods, step lengths, and ankle torques via nonlinear MPC. The ALIP
trajectories are used as references to a linear MPC framework that extends the
standard SRB-MPC to also include simplified arm and torso dynamics. We validate
the performance of our approach through simulation and hardware experiments on
the Unitree G1 humanoid robot. In the proposed framework the high-level step
planner runs at 40 Hz and the mid-level MPC at 500 Hz using the onboard
mini-PC. Adaptive step timing increased the push recovery success rate by 36%,
and the upper body control improved the yaw disturbance rejection. We also
demonstrate robust locomotion across diverse indoor and outdoor terrains,
including grass, stone pavement, and uneven gym mats.

Abstract: In the field of robot learning, coordinating robot actions through language
instructions is becoming increasingly feasible. However, adapting actions to
human instructions remains challenging, as such instructions are often
qualitative and require exploring behaviors that satisfy varying conditions.
This paper proposes a motion generation model that adapts robot actions in
response to modifier directives human instructions imposing behavioral
conditions during task execution. The proposed method learns a mapping from
modifier directives to actions by segmenting demonstrations into short
sequences, assigning weakly supervised labels corresponding to specific
modifier types. We evaluated our method in wiping and pick and place tasks.
Results show that it can adjust motions online in response to modifier
directives, unlike conventional batch-based methods that cannot adapt during
execution.

Abstract: Continuous advancements in robotics and AI are driving the integration of
robots from industry into everyday environments. However, dynamic and
unpredictable human activities in daily lives would directly or indirectly
conflict with robot actions. Besides, due to the social attributes of such

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving remains constrained by the need to generate
multi-modal actions, maintain temporal stability, and generalize across diverse
scenarios. Existing methods often collapse multi-modality, struggle with
long-horizon consistency, or lack modular adaptability. This paper presents
KDP, a knowledge-driven diffusion policy that integrates generative diffusion
modeling with a sparse mixture-of-experts routing mechanism. The diffusion
component generates temporally coherent and multi-modal action sequences, while
the expert routing mechanism activates specialized and reusable experts
according to context, enabling modular knowledge composition. Extensive
experiments across representative driving scenarios demonstrate that KDP
achieves consistently higher success rates, reduced collision risk, and
smoother control compared to prevailing paradigms. Ablation studies highlight
the effectiveness of sparse expert activation and the Transformer backbone, and
activation analyses reveal structured specialization and cross-scenario reuse
of experts. These results establish diffusion with expert routing as a scalable
and interpretable paradigm for knowledge-driven end-to-end autonomous driving.

Abstract: Topological localization is a fundamental problem in mobile robotics, since
robots must be able to determine their position in order to accomplish tasks.
Visual localization and place recognition are challenging due to perceptual
ambiguity, sensor noise, and illumination variations. This work addresses
topological localization in an office environment using only images acquired
with a perspective color camera mounted on a robot platform, without relying on
temporal continuity of image sequences. We evaluate state-of-the-art visual
descriptors, including Color Histograms, SIFT, ASIFT, RGB-SIFT, and
Bag-of-Visual-Words approaches inspired by text retrieval. Our contributions
include a systematic, quantitative comparison of these features, distance
measures, and classifiers. Performance was analyzed using standard evaluation
metrics and visualizations, extending previous experiments. Results demonstrate
the advantages of proper configurations of appearance descriptors, similarity
measures, and classifiers. The quality of these configurations was further
validated in the Robot Vision task of the ImageCLEF evaluation campaign, where
the system identified the most likely location of novel image sequences. Future
work will explore hierarchical models, ranking methods, and feature
combinations to build more robust localization systems, reducing training and
runtime while avoiding the curse of dimensionality. Ultimately, this aims
toward integrated, real-time localization across varied illumination and longer
routes.

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了在3D环境中高效、现实的路径规划，通过智能利用障碍物和八叉树压缩技术，在保持路径最优性的同时大幅提升了计算性能

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a 3D path planning method that integrates the A*
algorithm with the octree structure. Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) and legged
robots have been extensively studied, enabling locomotion across a variety of
terrains. Advances in mobility have enabled obstacles to be regarded not only
as hindrances to be avoided, but also as navigational aids when beneficial. A
modified 3D A* algorithm generates an optimal path by leveraging obstacles
during the planning process. By incorporating a height-based penalty into the
cost function, the algorithm enables the use of traversable obstacles to aid
locomotion while avoiding those that are impassable, resulting in more
efficient and realistic path generation. The octree-based 3D grid map achieves
compression by merging high-resolution nodes into larger blocks, especially in
obstacle-free or sparsely populated areas. This reduces the number of nodes
explored by the A* algorithm, thereby improving computational efficiency and
memory usage, and supporting real-time path planning in practical environments.
Benchmark results demonstrate that the use of octree structure ensures an
optimal path while significantly reducing memory usage and computation time.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) agents can learn to solve complex tasks from
visual inputs, but generalizing these learned skills to new environments
remains a major challenge in RL application, especially robotics. While data
augmentation can improve generalization, it often compromises sample efficiency
and training stability. This paper introduces DeGuV, an RL framework that
enhances both generalization and sample efficiency. In specific, we leverage a
learnable masker network that produces a mask from the depth input, preserving
only critical visual information while discarding irrelevant pixels. Through
this, we ensure that our RL agents focus on essential features, improving
robustness under data augmentation. In addition, we incorporate contrastive
learning and stabilize Q-value estimation under augmentation to further enhance
sample efficiency and training stability. We evaluate our proposed method on
the RL-ViGen benchmark using the Franka Emika robot and demonstrate its
effectiveness in zero-shot sim-to-real transfer. Our results show that DeGuV
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both generalization and sample
efficiency while also improving interpretability by highlighting the most
relevant regions in the visual input

Abstract: Deep learning, with its exceptional learning capabilities and flexibility,
has been widely applied in various applications. However, its black-box nature
poses a significant challenge in real-time robotic applications, particularly
in robot control, where trustworthiness and robustness are critical in ensuring
safety. In robot motion control, it is essential to analyze and ensure system
stability, necessitating the establishment of methodologies that address this
need. This paper aims to develop a theoretical framework for end-to-end deep
learning control that can be integrated into existing robot control theories.
The proposed control algorithm leverages a modular learning approach to update
the weights of all layers in real time, ensuring system stability based on
Lyapunov-like analysis. Experimental results on industrial robots are presented
to illustrate the performance of the proposed deep learning controller. The
proposed method offers an effective solution to the black-box problem in deep
learning, demonstrating the possibility of deploying real-time deep learning
strategies for robot kinematic control in a stable manner. This achievement
provides a critical foundation for future advancements in deep learning based
real-time robotic applications.

Abstract: Developing efficient Vision-Language-Action (VLA) policies is crucial for
practical robotics deployment, yet current approaches face prohibitive
computational costs and resource requirements. Existing diffusion-based VLA
policies require multi-billion-parameter models and massive datasets to achieve
strong performance. We tackle this efficiency challenge with two contributions:
intermediate-modality fusion, which reallocates capacity to the diffusion head
by pruning up to $50\%$ of LLM layers, and action-specific Global-AdaLN
conditioning, which cuts parameters by $20\%$ through modular adaptation. We
integrate these advances into a novel 950 M-parameter VLA called FLOWER.
Pretrained in just 200 H100 GPU hours, FLOWER delivers competitive performance
with bigger VLAs across $190$ tasks spanning ten simulation and real-world
benchmarks and demonstrates robustness across diverse robotic embodiments. In
addition, FLOWER achieves a new SoTA of 4.53 on the CALVIN ABC benchmark.

Abstract: Deictic gestures, like pointing, are a fundamental form of non-verbal
communication, enabling humans to direct attention to specific objects or
locations. This capability is essential in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), where
robots should be able to predict human intent and anticipate appropriate
responses. In this work, we propose the Multi-Modality Inter-TransFormer
(MM-ITF), a modular architecture to predict objects in a controlled tabletop
scenario with the NICOL robot, where humans indicate targets through natural
pointing gestures. Leveraging inter-modality attention, MM-ITF maps 2D pointing
gestures to object locations, assigns a likelihood score to each, and
identifies the most likely target. Our results demonstrate that the method can
accurately predict the intended object using monocular RGB data, thus enabling
intuitive and accessible human-robot collaboration. To evaluate the
performance, we introduce a patch confusion matrix, providing insights into the
model's predictions across candidate object locations. Code available at:

Abstract: Shared autonomy is a promising paradigm in robotic systems, particularly
within the maritime domain, where complex, high-risk, and uncertain
environments necessitate effective human-robot collaboration. This paper
investigates the interaction of three complementary approaches to advance
shared autonomy in heterogeneous marine robotic fleets: (i) the integration of
Large Language Models (LLMs) to facilitate intuitive high-level task
specification and support hull inspection missions, (ii) the implementation of
human-in-the-loop interaction frameworks in multi-agent settings to enable
adaptive and intent-aware coordination, and (iii) the development of a modular
Mission Manager based on Behavior Trees to provide interpretable and flexible
mission control. Preliminary results from simulation and real-world lake-like
environments demonstrate the potential of this multi-layered architecture to
reduce operator cognitive load, enhance transparency, and improve adaptive
behaviour alignment with human intent. Ongoing work focuses on fully
integrating these components, refining coordination mechanisms, and validating
the system in operational port scenarios. This study contributes to
establishing a modular and scalable foundation for trustworthy,
human-collaborative autonomy in safety-critical maritime robotics applications.

Abstract: This paper presents a robust model predictive control (MPC) framework that
explicitly addresses the non-Gaussian noise inherent in deep learning-based
perception modules used for state estimation. Recognizing that accurate
uncertainty quantification of the perception module is essential for safe
feedback control, our approach departs from the conventional assumption of
zero-mean noise quantification of the perception error. Instead, it employs
set-based state estimation with constrained zonotopes to capture biased,
heavy-tailed uncertainties while maintaining bounded estimation errors. To
improve computational efficiency, the robust MPC is reformulated as a linear
program (LP), using a Minkowski-Lyapunov-based cost function with an added
slack variable to prevent degenerate solutions. Closed-loop stability is
ensured through Minkowski-Lyapunov inequalities and contractive zonotopic
invariant sets. The largest stabilizing terminal set and its corresponding
feedback gain are then derived via an ellipsoidal approximation of the
zonotopes. The proposed framework is validated through both simulations and
hardware experiments on an omnidirectional mobile robot along with a camera and
a convolutional neural network-based perception module implemented within a
ROS2 framework. The results demonstrate that the perception-aware MPC provides
stable and accurate control performance under heavy-tailed noise conditions,
significantly outperforming traditional Gaussian-noise-based designs in terms
of both state estimation error bounding and overall control performance.
