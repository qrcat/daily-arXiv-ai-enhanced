### [1] [Label Smoothing++: Enhanced Label Regularization for Training Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05307)
*Sachin Chhabra,Hemanth Venkateswara,Baoxin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Label Smoothing++是一种新的标签正则化训练策略，通过为非目标类别分配非零概率并考虑类间关系，解决了传统标签平滑方法破坏类间关系的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的标签平滑方法虽然能改善网络泛化能力，但为所有非目标类别分配相同的重要性，破坏了类间关系。

Method: 提出Label Smoothing++方法，为目标类别使用固定标签，同时让网络学习非目标类别的标签，保持类间关系。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，Label Smoothing++能够减轻过度自信预测，同时促进类间关系和泛化能力。

Conclusion: Label Smoothing++是一种有效的标签正则化方法，在保持类间关系的同时改善了模型的泛化性能。

Abstract: Training neural networks with one-hot target labels often results in
overconfidence and overfitting. Label smoothing addresses this issue by
perturbing the one-hot target labels by adding a uniform probability vector to
create a regularized label. Although label smoothing improves the network's
generalization ability, it assigns equal importance to all the non-target
classes, which destroys the inter-class relationships. In this paper, we
propose a novel label regularization training strategy called Label
Smoothing++, which assigns non-zero probabilities to non-target classes and
accounts for their inter-class relationships. Our approach uses a fixed label
for the target class while enabling the network to learn the labels associated
with non-target classes. Through extensive experiments on multiple datasets, we
demonstrate how Label Smoothing++ mitigates overconfident predictions while
promoting inter-class relationships and generalization capabilities.

### [2] [VILOD: A Visual Interactive Labeling Tool for Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05317)
*Isac Holm*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VILOD是一个可视化交互标注工具，通过t-SNE投影、不确定性热图和模型状态视图，使目标检测中的人机协作标注过程更加透明和高效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目标检测的深度学习需要大量精确标注数据，但标注过程耗时昂贵。主动学习虽然能减少标注工作量，但缺乏透明度且可能忽略重要样本。

Method: 开发VILOD工具，集成t-SNE特征投影、不确定性热图和模型状态可视化，支持用户在交互式人机循环工作流中探索数据和实施多样本选择策略。

Result: 实证研究表明VILOD使模型状态和数据集特征更易解释，不同可视化引导的标注策略在目标检测性能上能与自动化不确定性采样基线竞争。

Conclusion: VILOD工具使目标检测的人机协作主动学习工作流更加透明、可管理且可能更有效，为人机协作标注提供了新工具和实证见解。

Abstract: The advancement of Object Detection (OD) using Deep Learning (DL) is often
hindered by the significant challenge of acquiring large, accurately labeled
datasets, a process that is time-consuming and expensive. While techniques like
Active Learning (AL) can reduce annotation effort by intelligently querying
informative samples, they often lack transparency, limit the strategic insight
of human experts, and may overlook informative samples not aligned with an
employed query strategy. To mitigate these issues, Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)
approaches integrating human intelligence and intuition throughout the machine
learning life-cycle have gained traction. Leveraging Visual Analytics (VA),
effective interfaces can be created to facilitate this human-AI collaboration.
This thesis explores the intersection of these fields by developing and
investigating "VILOD: A Visual Interactive Labeling tool for Object Detection".
VILOD utilizes components such as a t-SNE projection of image features,
together with uncertainty heatmaps and model state views. Enabling users to
explore data, interpret model states, AL suggestions, and implement diverse
sample selection strategies within an iterative HITL workflow for OD. An
empirical investigation using comparative use cases demonstrated how VILOD,
through its interactive visualizations, facilitates the implementation of
distinct labeling strategies by making the model's state and dataset
characteristics more interpretable (RQ1). The study showed that different
visually-guided labeling strategies employed within VILOD result in competitive
OD performance trajectories compared to an automated uncertainty sampling AL
baseline (RQ2). This work contributes a novel tool and empirical insight into
making the HITL-AL workflow for OD annotation more transparent, manageable, and
potentially more effective.

### [3] [Context-Aware Knowledge Distillation with Adaptive Weighting for Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05319)
*Zhengda Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出自适应知识蒸馏(AKD)框架，通过动态调整硬标签和软标签损失的平衡因子alpha，并使用上下文感知模块重新加权教师输出，提升知识蒸馏效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统知识蒸馏使用固定的平衡因子alpha来结合硬标签交叉熵损失和软标签蒸馏损失，但静态alpha不是最优的，因为硬监督和软监督之间的最优权衡在训练过程中会发生变化。

Method: 1) 将alpha作为可学习参数自动优化；2) 基于师生差异动态计算alpha；3) 引入上下文感知模块(CAM)，使用MLP+Attention自适应重新加权教师输出的类别权重。

Result: 在CIFAR-10数据集上，使用ResNet-50作为教师网络、ResNet-18作为学生网络的实验表明，该方法相比固定权重KD基线获得了更高的准确率，并实现了更稳定的收敛。

Conclusion: 自适应知识蒸馏框架通过动态调整损失权重和教师输出重加权，有效提升了知识蒸馏的性能和训练稳定性。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is a widely used technique to transfer knowledge
from a large teacher network to a smaller student model. Traditional KD uses a
fixed balancing factor alpha as a hyperparameter to combine the hard-label
cross-entropy loss with the soft-label distillation loss. However, a static
alpha is suboptimal because the optimal trade-off between hard and soft
supervision can vary during training.
  In this work, we propose an Adaptive Knowledge Distillation (AKD) framework.
First we try to make alpha as learnable parameter that can be automatically
learned and optimized during training. Then we introduce a formula to reflect
the gap between the student and the teacher to compute alpha dynamically,
guided by student-teacher discrepancies, and further introduce a Context-Aware
Module (CAM) using MLP + Attention to adaptively reweight class-wise teacher
outputs. Experiments on CIFAR-10 with ResNet-50 as teacher and ResNet-18 as
student demonstrate that our approach achieves superior accuracy compared to
fixed-weight KD baselines, and yields more stable convergence.

advancing multimodal research. This framework offers novel tools for emotion
analysis, data augmentation, and brain-computer interface applications, with
substantial research and engineering significance.

### [5] [Application of discrete Ricci curvature in pruning randomly wired neural networks: A case study with chest x-ray classification of COVID-19](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05322)
*Pavithra Elumalai,Sudharsan Vijayaraghavan,Madhumita Mondal,Areejit Samal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究比较了三种边中心网络度量（FRC、ORC、EBC）在随机有线神经网络中的剪枝效果，发现计算效率更高的FRC能达到与ORC相当的剪枝性能，同时显著降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索网络拓扑结构对深度学习性能的影响，寻找高效的神经网络剪枝方法，特别是在计算复杂度与剪枝效果之间寻求平衡。

Method: 使用三种边中心网络度量（Forman-Ricci曲率、Ollivier-Ricci曲率、边介数中心性）对三种随机网络生成器（ER、WS、BA模型）生成的RWNN进行剪枝，应用于COVID-19胸部X光图像分类任务。

Result: FRC剪枝方法在保持与ORC相当性能的同时，显著提高了计算效率。剪枝后的网络在准确率、特异性和敏感性方面表现良好，同时通过模块性和全局效率分析揭示了压缩网络的结构特性。

Conclusion: FRC作为一种计算效率更高的剪枝度量，能够有效简化随机有线神经网络，在保持性能的同时提供显著的计算优势，为神经网络优化提供了新的有效工具。

Abstract: Randomly Wired Neural Networks (RWNNs) serve as a valuable testbed for
investigating the impact of network topology in deep learning by capturing how
different connectivity patterns impact both learning efficiency and model
performance. At the same time, they provide a natural framework for exploring
edge-centric network measures as tools for pruning and optimization. In this
study, we investigate three edge-centric network measures: Forman-Ricci
curvature (FRC), Ollivier-Ricci curvature (ORC), and edge betweenness
centrality (EBC), to compress RWNNs by selectively retaining important synapses
(or edges) while pruning the rest. As a baseline, RWNNs are trained for
COVID-19 chest x-ray image classification, aiming to reduce network complexity
while preserving performance in terms of accuracy, specificity, and
sensitivity. We extend prior work on pruning RWNN using ORC by incorporating
two additional edge-centric measures, FRC and EBC, across three network
generators: Erd\"{o}s-R\'{e}nyi (ER) model, Watts-Strogatz (WS) model, and
Barab\'{a}si-Albert (BA) model. We provide a comparative analysis of the
pruning performance of the three measures in terms of compression ratio and
theoretical speedup. A central focus of our study is to evaluate whether FRC,
which is computationally more efficient than ORC, can achieve comparable
pruning effectiveness. Along with performance evaluation, we further
investigate the structural properties of the pruned networks through modularity
and global efficiency, offering insights into the trade-off between modular
segregation and network efficiency in compressed RWNNs. Our results provide
initial evidence that FRC-based pruning can effectively simplify RWNNs,
offering significant computational advantages while maintaining performance
comparable to ORC.

Motivation: 手写经典乐分籍包含声部和弦，现有OMR系统无法处理弦部分，且手写图像存在高变异性和质量问题。

Method: 构建包含293份手写经典乐分籍的数据集，提供同步的Humdrum **kern和MusicXML真实标注，以及从真实标注生成的合成分籍图像。研究适用于该类数据的特定标记化方案，利用合成分籍和预训练模型的优势。

Conclusion: 该研究为手写经典乐分籍的光学音乐识别提供了重要的数据资源和技术方案，有力地解决了现有系统在处理弦部分时的不足。

Abstract: In this paper, we address the challenge of Optical Music Recognition (OMR)
for handwritten jazz lead sheets, a widely used musical score type that encodes
melody and chords. The task is challenging due to the presence of chords, a
score component not handled by existing OMR systems, and the high variability
and quality issues associated with handwritten images. Our contribution is
two-fold. We present a novel dataset consisting of 293 handwritten jazz lead
sheets of 163 unique pieces, amounting to 2021 total staves aligned with
Humdrum **kern and MusicXML ground truth scores. We also supply synthetic score
images generated from the ground truth. The second contribution is the
development of an OMR model for jazz lead sheets. We discuss specific
tokenisation choices related to our kind of data, and the advantages of using
synthetic scores and pretrained models. We publicly release all code, data, and
models.

### [7] [RT-VLM: Re-Thinking Vision Language Model with 4-Clues for Real-World Object Recognition Robustness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05333)
*Junghyun Park,Tuan Anh Nguyen,Dugki Min*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RT-VLM框架通过合成数据集生成和两阶段推理机制，有效提升目标识别模型在域偏移下的鲁棒性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实部署中目标识别模型面临多种域偏移（图像统计变化、姿态变化、遮挡、类别混淆）导致精度严重下降，需要开发更鲁棒的视觉理解方法

Method: 1) 构建合成数据集生成管道，生成包含4种线索（边界框、类别名、对象级描述、场景级描述）的图像标注；2) 对Llama 3.2 11B Vision Instruct进行参数高效监督调优；3) 推理时执行两阶段重思考机制：首先生成4种线索，然后将其作为证据进行迭代修正

Result: 在隔离个体域偏移的鲁棒性基准测试中，RT-VLM持续超越强基线方法

Conclusion: 结构化多模态证据与显式自批判循环的结合是通向可靠且可迁移视觉理解的有前景路径

Abstract: Real world deployments often expose modern object recognition models to
domain shifts that precipitate a severe drop in accuracy. Such shifts encompass
(i) variations in low level image statistics, (ii) changes in object pose and
viewpoint, (iii) partial occlusion, and (iv) visual confusion across adjacent
classes. To mitigate this degradation, we introduce the Re-Thinking Vision
Language Model (RT-VLM) framework. The foundation of this framework is a unique
synthetic dataset generation pipeline that produces images annotated with
"4-Clues": precise bounding boxes, class names, detailed object-level captions,
and a comprehensive context-level caption for the entire scene. We then perform
parameter efficient supervised tuning of Llama 3.2 11B Vision Instruct on this
resource. At inference time, a two stage Re-Thinking scheme is executed: the
model first emits its own four clues, then re examines these responses as
evidence and iteratively corrects them. Across robustness benchmarks that
isolate individual domain shifts, RT-VLM consistently surpasses strong
baselines. These findings indicate that the integration of structured
multimodal evidence with an explicit self critique loop constitutes a promising
route toward reliable and transferable visual understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统体育性能测量技术质昂贵、复杂且无法满足业余玩家需求的问题，推广高级性能分析技术

Method: 使用自定制YOLOv5模型进行美缦球检测，结合卡尔曼滤波实现稳健轨迹跟踪，采用视频动力学速度估计方法进行时空缩放

Result: 开发出一套成本效益高、使用方便的移动应用，能够自动计算美缦球速度

Conclusion: 该系统普及了高级性能分析技术，使得各级别的美缦球玩家都能够分析和改进自己的技术

Abstract: Performance metrics in sports, such as shot speed and angle, provide crucial
feedback for athlete development. However, the technology to capture these
metrics has historically been expensive, complex, and largely inaccessible to
amateur and recreational players. This paper addresses this gap in the context
of badminton, one of the world's most popular sports, by introducing a novel,
cost-effective, and user-friendly system for measuring smash speed using
ubiquitous smartphone technology. Our approach leverages a custom-trained
YOLOv5 model for shuttlecock detection, combined with a Kalman filter for
robust trajectory tracking. By implementing a video-based kinematic speed
estimation method with spatiotemporal scaling, the system automatically
calculates the shuttlecock's velocity from a standard video recording. The
entire process is packaged into an intuitive mobile application, democratizing
access to high-level performance analytics and empowering players at all levels
to analyze and improve their game.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 中文手写数据库和工具箱的建立，揭示语言因素（正字法、音位学）在字符、部首和笔画层面对手写准备和执行的层级刻衰影响


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决中文手写研究中语言组件调控机制不清和缺乏细粒度数据批量处理工具的问题

Method: 建立大规模手写数据库（42人手写1200字符），升级OpenHandWrite_Toolbox工具箱，采用多元回归分析手写准备和执行参数

Result: 正字法因素在字符、部首和笔画层面都影响手写准备和执行；音位学因素在所有三个层面影响执行；词汇效应呈现层级刻衰（字符层>90e8首层>7b14画层）

Conclusion: 手写准备和执行在部首和笔画层面与语言组件密切相关，数据库和工具箱为语言心理学和神经语言学研究提供价值资源

Abstract: Understanding what linguistic components (e.g., phonological, semantic, and
orthographic systems) modulate Chinese handwriting at the character, radical,
and stroke levels remains an important yet understudied topic. Additionally,
there is a lack of comprehensive tools for capturing and batch-processing
fine-grained handwriting data. To address these issues, we constructed a
large-scale handwriting database in which 42 Chinese speakers for each
handwriting 1200 characters in a handwriting-to-dictation task. Additionally,
we enhanced the existing handwriting package and provided comprehensive
documentation for the upgraded OpenHandWrite_Toolbox, which can easily modify
the experimental design, capture the stroke-level handwriting trajectory, and
batch-process handwriting measurements (e.g., latency, duration, and
pen-pressure). In analysing our large-scale database, multiple regression
results show that orthographic predictors impact handwriting preparation and
execution across character, radical, and stroke levels. Phonological factors
also influence execution at all three levels. Importantly, these lexical
effects demonstrate hierarchical attenuation - they were most pronounced at the
character level, followed by the radical, and were weakest at the stroke
levels. These findings demonstrate that handwriting preparation and execution
at the radical and stroke levels are closely intertwined with linguistic
components. This database and toolbox offer valuable resources for future
psycholinguistic and neurolinguistic research on the handwriting of characters
and sub-characters across different languages.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于动态图神经网络和LSTM的混合模型，用于预测性跌倒检测，通过解耦运动预测和步态分类任务，实现了高精度的跌倒预警。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注跌倒检测，但跌倒发生前的预测以及稳定状态与即将跌倒之间的瞬态状态分析尚未得到充分探索，这对于辅助机器人系统至关重要。

Method: 使用混合模型：DGNN作为分类器区分稳定、瞬态和跌倒三种步态状态，LSTM网络预测后续时间步的人类运动。输入为从视频序列提取的实时骨骼特征。

Result: 在OUMVLP-Pose和URFD数据集上验证，相比仅使用DGNN的模型和文献中的模型，在预测误差和识别准确率方面表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: 解耦预测和分类任务相比统一处理方法能提升性能，同时该方法能够监测瞬态状态，为高级辅助系统功能增强提供有价值见解。

Abstract: Detecting and preventing falls in humans is a critical component of assistive
robotic systems. While significant progress has been made in detecting falls,
the prediction of falls before they happen, and analysis of the transient state
between stability and an impending fall remain unexplored. In this paper, we
propose a anticipatory fall detection method that utilizes a hybrid model
combining Dynamic Graph Neural Networks (DGNN) with Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM) networks that decoupled the motion prediction and gait classification
tasks to anticipate falls with high accuracy. Our approach employs real-time
skeletal features extracted from video sequences as input for the proposed
model. The DGNN acts as a classifier, distinguishing between three gait states:
stable, transient, and fall. The LSTM-based network then predicts human
movement in subsequent time steps, enabling early detection of falls. The
proposed model was trained and validated using the OUMVLP-Pose and URFD
datasets, demonstrating superior performance in terms of prediction error and
recognition accuracy compared to models relying solely on DGNN and models from
literature. The results indicate that decoupling prediction and classification
improves performance compared to addressing the unified problem using only the
DGNN. Furthermore, our method allows for the monitoring of the transient state,
offering valuable insights that could enhance the functionality of advanced
assistance systems.

*Dibya Jyoti Bora,Mrinal Kanti Mishra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文对比了K-Means和FCM两种聚类算法在MRI脑罐分割中的性能，K-Means计算更快但准确性较低，FCM准确性更高但计算成本更高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 精确的脑罐分割对临床决策和攻击疗法规划至关重要，需要研究不同聚类方法在这一任务中的性能差异。

Method: 使用BraTS2020数据集，通过高斯滤波和CLAHE预处理，对比K-Means（硬聚类）和FCM（软聚类）两种算法的分割效果。

Result: K-Means平均运行时间0.3秒，DSC指标0.43；FCM平均运行时间1.3秒，DSC指标0.67。

Conclusion: 硬聚类和软聚类在计算效率与边界准确性之间存在明显的交换关系，应根据具体应用需求选择适宜的算法。

Abstract: Segmentation of brain tumors from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) remains a
pivotal challenge in medical image analysis due to the heterogeneous nature of
tumor morphology and intensity distributions. Accurate delineation of tumor
boundaries is critical for clinical decision-making, radiotherapy planning, and
longitudinal disease monitoring. In this study, we perform a comprehensive
comparative analysis of two major clustering paradigms applied in MRI tumor
segmentation: hard clustering, exemplified by the K-Means algorithm, and soft
clustering, represented by Fuzzy C-Means (FCM). While K-Means assigns each
pixel strictly to a single cluster, FCM introduces partial memberships, meaning
each pixel can belong to multiple clusters with varying degrees of association.
Experimental validation was performed using the BraTS2020 dataset,
incorporating pre-processing through Gaussian filtering and Contrast Limited
Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE). Evaluation metrics included the Dice
Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and processing time, which collectively
demonstrated that K-Means achieved superior speed with an average runtime of
0.3s per image, whereas FCM attained higher segmentation accuracy with an
average DSC of 0.67 compared to 0.43 for K-Means, albeit at a higher
computational cost (1.3s per image). These results highlight the inherent
trade-off between computational efficiency and boundary precision.

Abstract: Accurate classification of pests and diseases plays a vital role in precision
agriculture, enabling efficient identification, targeted interventions, and
preventing their further spread. However, current methods primarily focus on
binary classification, which limits their practical applications, especially in
scenarios where accurately identifying the specific type of disease or pest is
essential. We propose a robust deep learning based model for multi-class
classification of onion crop diseases and pests. We enhance a pre-trained
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model by integrating attention based modules
and employing comprehensive data augmentation pipeline to mitigate class
imbalance. We propose a model which gives 96.90% overall accuracy and 0.96 F1
score on real-world field image dataset. This model gives better results than
other approaches using the same datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有蒸馏采样方法中普遍存在的过平滑伪影问题，提供更高质量的无反演文本到图像编辑。

Method: 提出Delta Velocity Rectified Flow框架，包含速度场差异建模和时间相关偏移项，通过理论分析连接基于分数的扩散优化和基于速度的整流流优化。

Result: 实验结果表明DVRF在编辑质量、保真度和可控性方面表现优异，无需架构修改即可高效应用于文本到图像编辑任务。

Conclusion: DVRF为整流流模型中的无反演编辑提供了理论解释和实用框架，在保持高效性的同时显著提升了编辑效果。

Abstract: We propose Delta Velocity Rectified Flow (DVRF), a novel inversion-free,
path-aware editing framework within rectified flow models for text-to-image
editing. DVRF is a distillation-based method that explicitly models the
discrepancy between the source and target velocity fields in order to mitigate
over-smoothing artifacts rampant in prior distillation sampling approaches. We
further introduce a time-dependent shift term to push noisy latents closer to
the target trajectory, enhancing the alignment with the target distribution. We
theoretically demonstrate that when this shift is disabled, DVRF reduces to
Delta Denoising Score, thereby bridging score-based diffusion optimization and
velocity-based rectified-flow optimization. Moreover, when the shift term
follows a linear schedule under rectified-flow dynamics, DVRF generalizes the
Inversion-free method FlowEdit and provides a principled theoretical
interpretation for it. Experimental results indicate that DVRF achieves
superior editing quality, fidelity, and controllability while requiring no
architectural modifications, making it efficient and broadly applicable to
text-to-image editing tasks. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CNN难以捕捉医学影像中细粒度和复杂特征，限制了准确诊断的能力，需要增强模型对关键区域的关注能力

Method: 在VGG16、ResNet18、InceptionV3、DenseNet121和EfficientNetB5五种CNN架构中集成Squeeze and Excitation模块或混合Convolutional Block Attention Module，进行通道和空间特征的自适应重校准

Conclusion: 注意力机制能有效提升医学影像分析的分类准确性和特征定位能力，为开发鲁棒、可解释且临床适用的深度学习决策支持系统提供了实用见解

Abstract: Deep learning has become a powerful tool for medical image analysis; however,
conventional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) often fail to capture the
fine-grained and complex features critical for accurate diagnosis. To address
this limitation, we systematically integrate attention mechanisms into five
widely adopted CNN architectures, namely, VGG16, ResNet18, InceptionV3,
DenseNet121, and EfficientNetB5, to enhance their ability to focus on salient
regions and improve discriminative performance. Specifically, each baseline
model is augmented with either a Squeeze and Excitation block or a hybrid
Convolutional Block Attention Module, allowing adaptive recalibration of
channel and spatial feature representations. The proposed models are evaluated
on two distinct medical imaging datasets, a brain tumor MRI dataset comprising
multiple tumor subtypes, and a Products of Conception histopathological dataset
containing four tissue categories. Experimental results demonstrate that
attention augmented CNNs consistently outperform baseline architectures across
all metrics. In particular, EfficientNetB5 with hybrid attention achieves the
highest overall performance, delivering substantial gains on both datasets.
Beyond improved classification accuracy, attention mechanisms enhance feature
localization, leading to better generalization across heterogeneous imaging
modalities. This work contributes a systematic comparative framework for
embedding attention modules in diverse CNN architectures and rigorously
assesses their impact across multiple medical imaging tasks. The findings
provide practical insights for the development of robust, interpretable, and
clinically applicable deep learning based decision support systems.

Abstract: Timely and accurate detection of defects and contaminants in solar panels is
critical for maintaining the efficiency and reliability of photovoltaic
systems. This study presents a comprehensive evaluation of five
state-of-the-art object detection models: YOLOv3, Faster R-CNN, RetinaNet,
EfficientDet, and Swin Transformer, for identifying physical and electrical
defects as well as surface contaminants such as dust, dirt, and bird droppings
on solar panels. A custom dataset, annotated in the COCO format and
specifically designed for solar panel defect and contamination detection, was
developed alongside a user interface to train and evaluate the models. The
performance of each model is assessed and compared based on mean Average
Precision (mAP), precision, recall, and inference speed. The results
demonstrate the trade-offs between detection accuracy and computational
efficiency, highlighting the relative strengths and limitations of each model.
These findings provide valuable guidance for selecting appropriate detection
approaches in practical solar panel monitoring and maintenance scenarios.

Abstract: Instance segmentation is essential for numerous computer vision applications,
including robotics, human-computer interaction, and autonomous driving.
Currently, popular models bring impressive performance in instance segmentation
by training with a large number of human annotations, which are costly to
collect. For this reason, we present a new framework that efficiently and
effectively segments objects without the need for human annotations. Firstly, a
MultiCut algorithm is applied to self-supervised features for coarse mask
segmentation. Then, a mask filter is employed to obtain high-quality coarse
masks. To train the segmentation network, we compute a novel superpixel-guided
mask loss, comprising hard loss and soft loss, with high-quality coarse masks
and superpixels segmented from low-level image features. Lastly, a
self-training process with a new adaptive loss is proposed to improve the
quality of predicted masks. We conduct experiments on public datasets in
instance segmentation and object detection to demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed framework. The results show that the proposed framework
outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Cell biomechanics involve a great number of complex phenomena that are
fundamental to the evolution of life itself and other associated processes,
ranging from the very early stages of embryo-genesis to the maintenance of
damaged structures or the growth of tumors. Given the importance of such
phenomena, increasing research has been dedicated to their understanding, but
the many interactions between them and their influence on the decisions of
cells as a collective network or cluster remain unclear. We present a new
approach that combines Structure Preserving Neural Networks, which study cell
movements as a purely mechanical system, with other Machine Learning tools
(Artificial Neural Networks), which allow taking into consideration
environmental factors that can be directly deduced from an experiment with
Computer Vision techniques. This new model, tested on simulated and real cell
migration cases, predicts complete cell trajectories following a roll-out
policy with a high level of accuracy. This work also includes a mitosis event
prediction model based on Neural Networks architectures which makes use of the
same observed features.

Abstract: Latent generative models have shown remarkable progress in high-fidelity
image synthesis, typically using a two-stage training process that involves
compressing images into latent embeddings via learned tokenizers in the first
stage. The quality of generation strongly depends on how expressive and
well-optimized these latent embeddings are. While various methods have been
proposed to learn effective latent representations, the reconstructed images
often lack realism, particularly in textured regions with sharp transitions,
due to loss of fine details governed by high frequencies. We conduct a detailed
frequency decomposition of existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) latent tokenizers
and show that conventional objectives inherently prioritize low-frequency
reconstruction, often at the expense of high-frequency fidelity. Our analysis
reveals these latent tokenizers exhibit a bias toward low-frequency
information, when jointly optimized, leading to over-smoothed outputs and
visual artifacts that diminish perceptual quality. To address this, we propose
a wavelet-based, frequency-aware variational autoencoder (FA-VAE) framework
that explicitly decouples the optimization of low- and high-frequency
components. This decoupling enables improved reconstruction of fine textures
while preserving global structure. Our approach bridges the fidelity gap in
current latent tokenizers and emphasizes the importance of frequency-aware
optimization for realistic image representation, with broader implications for
applications in content creation, neural rendering, and medical imaging.

Abstract: Deep Convolutional Neural Networks have achieved state of the art performance
across various computer vision tasks, however their practical deployment is
limited by computational and memory overhead. This paper introduces
Differential Sensitivity Fusion Pruning, a novel single shot filter pruning
framework that focuses on evaluating the stability and redundancy of filter
importance scores across multiple criteria. Differential Sensitivity Fusion
Pruning computes a differential sensitivity score for each filter by fusing the
discrepancies among gradient based sensitivity, first order Taylor expansion,
and KL divergence of activation distributions. An exponential scaling mechanism
is applied to emphasize filters with inconsistent importance across metrics,
identifying candidates that are structurally unstable or less critical to the
model performance. Unlike iterative or reinforcement learning based pruning
strategies, Differential Sensitivity Fusion Pruning is efficient and
deterministic, requiring only a single forward-backward pass for scoring and
pruning. Extensive experiments across varying pruning rates between 50 to 70
percent demonstrate that Differential Sensitivity Fusion Pruning significantly
reduces model complexity, achieving over 80 percent Floating point Operations
Per Seconds reduction while maintaining high accuracy. For instance, at 70
percent pruning, our approach retains up to 98.23 percent of baseline accuracy,
surpassing traditional heuristics in both compression and generalization. The
proposed method presents an effective solution for scalable and adaptive Deep
Convolutional Neural Networks compression, paving the way for efficient
deployment on edge and mobile platforms.

Motivation: 资源突出环境下部署YOLO需要高效转移学习，但对于当代YOLOv8和YOLOv10的冻结策略影响仍不明确

Method: 系统分析多种冻结配置，集成梯度行为分析(L2范数)和可视化解释(Grad-CAM)来揭示训练动态

Conclusion: 提供了基于实证的实践指南，为资源突出环境下的对象检测转移学习提供平衡的解决方案

Abstract: The You Only Look Once (YOLO) architecture is crucial for real-time object
detection. However, deploying it in resource-constrained environments such as
unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) requires efficient transfer learning. Although
layer freezing is a common technique, the specific impact of various freezing
configurations on contemporary YOLOv8 and YOLOv10 architectures remains
unexplored, particularly with regard to the interplay between freezing depth,
dataset characteristics, and training dynamics. This research addresses this
gap by presenting a detailed analysis of layer-freezing strategies. We
systematically investigate multiple freezing configurations across YOLOv8 and
YOLOv10 variants using four challenging datasets that represent critical
infrastructure monitoring. Our methodology integrates a gradient behavior
analysis (L2 norm) and visual explanations (Grad-CAM) to provide deeper
insights into training dynamics under different freezing strategies. Our
results reveal that there is no universal optimal freezing strategy but,
rather, one that depends on the properties of the data. For example, freezing
the backbone is effective for preserving general-purpose features, while a
shallower freeze is better suited to handling extreme class imbalance. These
configurations reduce graphics processing unit (GPU) memory consumption by up
to 28% compared to full fine-tuning and, in some cases, achieve mean average
precision (mAP@50) scores that surpass those of full fine-tuning. Gradient
analysis corroborates these findings, showing distinct convergence patterns for
moderately frozen models. Ultimately, this work provides empirical findings and
practical guidelines for selecting freezing strategies. It offers a practical,
evidence-based approach to balanced transfer learning for object detection in
scenarios with limited resources.

Conclusion: QUAN在资源受限的机器人系统中具有部署潜力，适用于需要旋转感知的其他领域

Abstract: This paper introduces Quaternion Approximate Networks (QUAN), a novel deep
learning framework that leverages quaternion algebra for rotation equivariant
image classification and object detection. Unlike conventional quaternion
neural networks attempting to operate entirely in the quaternion domain, QUAN
approximates quaternion convolution through Hamilton product decomposition
using real-valued operations. This approach preserves geometric properties
while enabling efficient implementation with custom CUDA kernels. We introduce
Independent Quaternion Batch Normalization (IQBN) for training stability and
extend quaternion operations to spatial attention mechanisms. QUAN is evaluated
on image classification (CIFAR-10/100, ImageNet), object detection (COCO,
DOTA), and robotic perception tasks. In classification tasks, QUAN achieves
higher accuracy with fewer parameters and faster convergence compared to
existing convolution and quaternion-based models. For objection detection, QUAN
demonstrates improved parameter efficiency and rotation handling over standard
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) while establishing the SOTA for quaternion
CNNs in this downstream task. These results highlight its potential for
deployment in resource-constrained robotic systems requiring rotation-aware
perception and application in other domains.

Abstract: Recently, distilling open-vocabulary language features from 2D images into 3D
Gaussians has attracted significant attention. Although existing methods
achieve impressive language-based interactions of 3D scenes, we observe two
fundamental issues: background Gaussians contributing negligibly to a rendered
pixel get the same feature as the dominant foreground ones, and multi-view
inconsistencies due to view-specific noise in language embeddings. We introduce
Visibility-Aware Language Aggregation (VALA), a lightweight yet effective
method that computes marginal contributions for each ray and applies a
visibility-aware gate to retain only visible Gaussians. Moreover, we propose a
streaming weighted geometric median in cosine space to merge noisy multi-view
features. Our method yields a robust, view-consistent language feature
embedding in a fast and memory-efficient manner. VALA improves open-vocabulary
localization and segmentation across reference datasets, consistently
surpassing existing works.

Result: 在未修剪数据集上的实验显示，DuoCLR在多类和多标签动作分割任务中均显著优于最先进方法

Conclusion: 所提出的对比学习框架通过创新的数据增强和双代理任务设计，有效学习了适用于动作分割的多尺度特征表示

Abstract: In this paper, a contrastive representation learning framework is proposed to
enhance human action segmentation via pre-training using trimmed (single
action) skeleton sequences. Unlike previous representation learning works that
are tailored for action recognition and that build upon isolated sequence-wise
representations, the proposed framework focuses on exploiting multi-scale
representations in conjunction with cross-sequence variations. More
specifically, it proposes a novel data augmentation strategy, 'Shuffle and
Warp', which exploits diverse multi-action permutations. The latter effectively
assists two surrogate tasks that are introduced in contrastive learning: Cross
Permutation Contrasting (CPC) and Relative Order Reasoning (ROR). In
optimization, CPC learns intra-class similarities by contrasting
representations of the same action class across different permutations, while
ROR reasons about inter-class contexts by predicting relative mapping between
two permutations. Together, these tasks enable a Dual-Surrogate Contrastive
Learning (DuoCLR) network to learn multi-scale feature representations
optimized for action segmentation. In experiments, DuoCLR is pre-trained on a
trimmed skeleton dataset and evaluated on an untrimmed dataset where it
demonstrates a significant boost over state-the-art comparatives in both
multi-class and multi-label action segmentation tasks. Lastly, ablation studies
are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of each component of the proposed
approach.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了事件流不完整性导致的运动先验知识欠缺问题，通过健壮性培养和解耦表征学习，实现了更有效的事件导向去模糊

Abstract: Event cameras provide sparse yet temporally high-temporal-resolution motion
information, demonstrating great potential for motion deblurring. Existing
methods focus on cross-modal interaction, overlooking the inherent
incompleteness of event streams, which arises from the trade-off between
sensitivity and noise introduced by the thresholding mechanism of Dynamic
Vision Sensors (DVS). Such degradation compromises the integrity of motion
priors and limits the effectiveness of event-guided deblurring. To tackle these
challenges, we propose a Robust Event-guided Deblurring (RED) network with
modality-specific disentangled representation. First, we introduce a
Robustness-Oriented Perturbation Strategy (RPS) that applies random masking to
events, which exposes RED to incomplete patterns and then foster robustness
against various unknown scenario conditions.Next, a disentangled OmniAttention
is presented to explicitly model intra-motion, inter-motion, and cross-modality
correlations from two inherently distinct but complementary sources: blurry
images and partially disrupted events. Building on these reliable features, two
interactive modules are designed to enhance motion-sensitive areas in blurry
images and inject semantic context into incomplete event representations.
Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate RED
consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and
robustness.

Abstract: Model quantization reduces neural network parameter precision to achieve
compression, but often compromises accuracy. Existing post-training
quantization (PTQ) methods employ iterative parameter updates to preserve
accuracy under high compression ratios, incurring significant computational
complexity and resource overhead, which limits applicability in
resource-constrained edge computing and real-time inference scenarios. This
paper proposes an efficient PTQ method guided by parameter sensitivity
analysis. The approach prioritizes quantization of high-sensitivity parameters,
leveraging unquantized low-sensitivity parameters to compensate for
quantization errors, thereby mitigating accuracy degradation. Furthermore, by
exploiting column-wise clustering of parameter sensitivity, the method
introduces a row-parallel quantization framework with a globally shared inverse
Hessian matrix update mechanism, reducing computational complexity by an order
of magnitude. Experimental results on ResNet-50 and YOLOv5s demonstrate a
20-200-fold quantization speedup over the Optimal Brain Quantization baseline,
with mean accuracy loss below 0.3%, confirming the method's efficacy in
balancing efficiency and accuracy.

Method: 基于WebSSL构建大规模单样本高斯头生成器，采用两阶段训练策略增强泛化能力和高频纹理重建，使用超轻量级高斯头像进行信号驱动

Result: 在512x512分辨率下达到90FPS渲染速度，定量和定性实验均优于现有SOTA方法，且遵循缩放定律参数增加性能提升

Conclusion: 分离式框架设计成功实现了高质量3D头像生成与高效驱动的平衡，为实时数字人应用提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: In this paper, we explore a reconstruction and reenactment separated
framework for 3D Gaussians head, which requires only a single portrait image as
input to generate controllable avatar. Specifically, we developed a large-scale
one-shot gaussian head generator built upon WebSSL and employed a two-stage
training approach that significantly enhances the capabilities of
generalization and high-frequency texture reconstruction. During inference, an
ultra-lightweight gaussian avatar driven by control signals enables high
frame-rate rendering, achieving 90 FPS at a resolution of 512x512. We further
demonstrate that the proposed framework follows the scaling law, whereby
increasing the parameter scale of the reconstruction module leads to improved
performance. Moreover, thanks to the separation design, driving efficiency
remains unaffected. Finally, extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments
validate that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了MFFI多维度人脸伪造图像数据集，针对现有Deepfake检测数据集在真实场景多样性不足的问题，通过四个维度增强真实性：更广泛的伪造方法、多样化的面部场景、多样化的真实数据、多级退化操作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI生成内容(AIGC)技术快速发展，人脸伪造技术日益复杂，对社会安全构成威胁。但现有Deepfake检测方法受限于数据集多样性不足，无法适应真实世界场景的需求。

Method: 构建MFFI数据集，基于四个策略维度：1)包含50种不同伪造方法；2)多样化的面部场景；3)多样化的真实数据；4)多级退化操作。数据集包含1024K图像样本。

Result: 基准评估显示MFFI在场景复杂性、跨域泛化能力和检测难度梯度方面优于现有公共数据集，验证了其在模拟真实世界条件方面的技术先进性和实用性。

Conclusion: MFFI数据集通过多维度的真实性增强策略，为Deepfake检测提供了更接近真实场景的基准数据集，有助于提升检测模型在现实世界中的性能表现。

Abstract: Rapid advances in Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) have
enabled increasingly sophisticated face forgeries, posing a significant threat
to social security. However, current Deepfake detection methods are limited by
constraints in existing datasets, which lack the diversity necessary in
real-world scenarios. Specifically, these data sets fall short in four key
areas: unknown of advanced forgery techniques, variability of facial scenes,
richness of real data, and degradation of real-world propagation. To address
these challenges, we propose the Multi-dimensional Face Forgery Image
(\textbf{MFFI}) dataset, tailored for real-world scenarios. MFFI enhances
realism based on four strategic dimensions: 1) Wider Forgery Methods; 2) Varied
Facial Scenes; 3) Diversified Authentic Data; 4) Multi-level Degradation
Operations. MFFI integrates $50$ different forgery methods and contains $1024K$
image samples. Benchmark evaluations show that MFFI outperforms existing public
datasets in terms of scene complexity, cross-domain generalization capability,
and detection difficulty gradients. These results validate the technical
advance and practical utility of MFFI in simulating real-world conditions. The
dataset and additional details are publicly available at

*Jungin Park,Jiyoung Lee,Kwanghoon Sohn*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoGraph提出了一种语言引导的时空图建模方法，通过递归时空图网络将对象和帧分别建模为空间和时间图节点，利用语言查询增强语义关系，在视频摘要任务上取得了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视频摘要方法主要关注帧间的时序建模，但忽略了细粒度视觉实体（如对象）与视频主要内容的关系。语言引导的视频摘要需要全面理解复杂真实世界视频的语义信息。

Method: 提出递归时空图网络VideoGraph，将对象和帧分别作为空间图和时间图的节点，通过图边连接表示语义关系。引入语言查询来增强节点表示的语义知识，避免仅基于视觉相似性配置边。采用递归策略优化初始图并正确分类关键帧。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，VideoGraph在有监督和无监督设置下，在通用和查询聚焦的视频摘要任务上都达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 将视频摘要视为语言引导的时空图建模问题是有效的，通过语义关系建模和语言查询的整合，能够更好地理解视频内容并生成高质量摘要。

Abstract: Video summarization aims to select keyframes that are visually diverse and
can represent the whole story of a given video. Previous approaches have
focused on global interlinkability between frames in a video by temporal
modeling. However, fine-grained visual entities, such as objects, are also
highly related to the main content of the video. Moreover, language-guided
video summarization, which has recently been studied, requires a comprehensive
linguistic understanding of complex real-world videos. To consider how all the
objects are semantically related to each other, this paper regards video
summarization as a language-guided spatiotemporal graph modeling problem. We
present recursive spatiotemporal graph networks, called VideoGraph, which
formulate the objects and frames as nodes of the spatial and temporal graphs,
respectively. The nodes in each graph are connected and aggregated with graph
edges, representing the semantic relationships between the nodes. To prevent
the edges from being configured with visual similarity, we incorporate language
queries derived from the video into the graph node representations, enabling
them to contain semantic knowledge. In addition, we adopt a recursive strategy
to refine initial graphs and correctly classify each frame node as a keyframe.
In our experiments, VideoGraph achieves state-of-the-art performance on several
benchmarks for generic and query-focused video summarization in both supervised
and unsupervised manners. The code is available at

TL;DR: 提出Patch-level Kernel Alignment (PaKA)方法，通过自监督学习将预训练的语义知识转移到密集特征空间，在多个密集视觉基准测试中达到最先进性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自监督表示学习方法主要关注全局表示，但密集视觉任务需要空间精度和细粒度细节，需要捕获局部语义信息

Method: 基于预训练表示进行额外自监督学习，提出PaKA对齐目标来匹配教师和学生模型之间密集补丁的统计依赖关系和结构关系，并研究专门为密集表示学习设计的增强策略

Result: 在多个密集视觉基准测试中取得了最先进的结果

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了密集预测任务中局部语义捕获不足的问题，证明了通过自监督学习将语义知识转移到密集特征空间的有效性

Abstract: Dense representations are essential for vision tasks that require spatial
precision and fine-grained detail. While most self-supervised representation
learning methods focus on global representations that summarize the image as a
whole, such approaches often fall short in capturing the localized semantics
necessary for dense prediction tasks. To overcome these limitations, we propose
a framework that builds on pretrained representations through additional
self-supervised learning, aiming to transfer existing semantic knowledge into
the dense feature space. Our method aligns the distributions of dense features
between a teacher and a student model. Specifically, we introduce Patch-level
Kernel Alignment (PaKA), a simple yet effective alignment objective that
captures statistical dependencies, thereby matching the structural
relationships of dense patches across the two models. In addition, we
investigate augmentation strategies specifically designed for dense
representation learning. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art results across
a variety of dense vision benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our
approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpecPrune-VLA是一种无需训练的双层剪枝方法，利用局部和全局信息进行智能token选择，在VLA模型上实现显著加速且保持成功率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLA模型剪枝方法仅使用当前动作的局部信息，忽略历史动作的全局上下文，导致成功率下降超过20%且加速有限。观察到连续动作间的高相似性，需要同时利用局部和全局信息进行更智能的token选择

Method: 提出SpecPrune-VLA方法：1）动作级静态剪枝：使用全局历史和局部上下文减少每动作的视觉token；2）层级动态剪枝：基于层级重要性逐层剪枝token；3）轻量级动作感知控制器：按速度将动作分类为粗/细粒度，调整剪枝强度

Result: 在LIBERO数据集上，SpecPrune-VLA相比OpenVLA-OFT在NVIDIA A800上实现1.46倍加速，在NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090上实现1.57倍加速，成功率损失可忽略不计

Conclusion: 通过结合局部和全局信息进行智能token选择，SpecPrune-VLA能够在保持VLA模型性能的同时显著提升计算效率，为计算密集型模型的加速提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Pruning accelerates compute-bound models by reducing computation. Recently
applied to Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, existing methods prune tokens
using only local info from current action, ignoring global context from prior
actions, causing >20% success rate drop and limited speedup. We observe high
similarity across consecutive actions and propose leveraging both local
(current) and global (past) info for smarter token selection. We introduce
SpecPrune-VLA, a training-free method with two-level pruning and heuristic
control: (1) Static pruning at action level: uses global history and local
context to reduce visual tokens per action; (2) Dynamic pruning at layer level:
prunes tokens per layer based on layer-specific importance; (3) Lightweight
action-aware controller: classifies actions as coarse/fine-grained (by speed),
adjusting pruning aggressiveness since fine-grained actions are
pruning-sensitive. Experiments on LIBERO show SpecPrune-VLA achieves 1.46 times
speedup on NVIDIA A800 and 1.57 times on NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 vs.
OpenVLA-OFT, with negligible success rate loss.

*Kien Nguyen,Anh Tran,Cuong Pham*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Subspace Mapping (SuMa)方法，专门用于从文本到图像扩散模型中稳健且有效地擦除狭窄概念（如版权角色、名人等），解决了现有方法在鲁棒性和有效性之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有概念擦除方法无法同时实现鲁棒性和有效性，特别是对于狭窄概念（如版权角色、名人）的擦除存在挑战，这些概念与邻近非目标概念距离较近，需要更精细的操作。

Method: SuMa方法首先推导出表示要擦除概念的目标子空间，然后通过将其映射到最小化两者距离的参考子空间来中和该概念，确保在保持图像质量的同时稳健擦除目标概念。

Result: 在四个任务（子类擦除、名人擦除、艺术风格擦除和实例擦除）上的广泛实验表明，SuMa在图像质量上与专注于有效性的方法相当，同时在完整性方面与目标方法结果相当。

Conclusion: SuMa方法成功解决了狭窄概念擦除的挑战，实现了鲁棒性和有效性的平衡，为处理版权和法律问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid growth of text-to-image diffusion models has raised concerns about
their potential misuse in generating harmful or unauthorized contents. To
address these issues, several Concept Erasure methods have been proposed.
However, most of them fail to achieve both robustness, i.e., the ability to
robustly remove the target concept., and effectiveness, i.e., maintaining image
quality. While few recent techniques successfully achieve these goals for NSFW
concepts, none could handle narrow concepts such as copyrighted characters or
celebrities. Erasing these narrow concepts is critical in addressing copyright
and legal concerns. However, erasing them is challenging due to their close
distances to non-target neighboring concepts, requiring finer-grained
manipulation. In this paper, we introduce Subspace Mapping (SuMa), a novel
method specifically designed to achieve both robustness and effectiveness in
easing these narrow concepts. SuMa first derives a target subspace representing
the concept to be erased and then neutralizes it by mapping it to a reference
subspace that minimizes the distance between the two. This mapping ensures the
target concept is robustly erased while preserving image quality. We conduct
extensive experiments with SuMa across four tasks: subclass erasure, celebrity
erasure, artistic style erasure, and instance erasure and compare the results
with current state-of-the-art methods. Our method achieves image quality
comparable to approaches focused on effectiveness, while also yielding results
that are on par with methods targeting completeness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 航空遥感中的多光谱和RGB成像技术推动了精准农业的发展，但高光谱图像标签有限或无标签的情况下的分析具有挑战性。需要开发能够有效提取植被特性的表示学习方法。

Method: 采用自监督学习方法来构建神经网络嵌入空间，该空间能够反映树木的植被特性。通过航空高光谱图像训练网络，生成与植被特性相关的嵌入表示。

Result: 实验结果表明，使用基于植被特性嵌入空间构建的树木表示，在下游机器学习任务中的性能优于直接使用高光谱植被特性作为树木表示的方法。

Conclusion: 自监督学习能够有效从高光谱图像中提取有意义的植被特性嵌入表示，为精准农业中的树木分析提供了更好的特征表示方法，有助于解决标签稀缺的问题。

Abstract: Aerial remote sensing using multispectral and RGB imagers has provided a
critical impetus to precision agriculture. Analysis of the hyperspectral images
with limited or no labels is challenging. This paper focuses on self-supervised
learning to create neural network embeddings reflecting vegetation properties
of trees from aerial hyperspectral images of crop fields. Experimental results
demonstrate that a constructed tree representation, using a vegetation
property-related embedding space, performs better in downstream machine
learning tasks compared to the direct use of hyperspectral vegetation
properties as tree representations.

TL;DR: 这项研究评估了六种YOLO模型在孜加拉地区特有车辆检测中的性能，YOLOv11x表现最优但速度慢，中等模型在性能和速度之间取得平衡，突出了小样本车辆类别的检测困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 因为基于非孜加拉数据集训练的车辆检测系统在孜加拉特有道路环境中表现差异，影响自动驾驶技术在发展中地区的应用。

Method: 使用移动手机摄像头收集高清图片，手动标注包含29种孜加拉特有车辆类别的数据集，对六种YOLO模型变体进行性能评测。

Result: YOLOv11x获得63.7% mAP@0.5最佳性能，但推理时间45.8毫秒；YOLOv8m和YOLOv11m在性能和速度之间取得最佳平衡，构建车辆和本地Nosimon等稀缺车辆类别检测准确度近于零。

Conclusion: 研究为孜加拉道路环境特定的强壁物体检测系统建立了基础，解决了通用模型在发展中地区效果不佳的问题。

Abstract: Vehicle detection systems trained on Non-Bangladeshi datasets struggle to
accurately identify local vehicle types in Bangladesh's unique road
environments, creating critical gaps in autonomous driving technology for
developing regions. This study evaluates six YOLO model variants on a custom
dataset featuring 29 distinct vehicle classes, including region-specific
vehicles such as ``Desi Nosimon'', ``Leguna'', ``Battery Rickshaw'', and
``CNG''. The dataset comprises high-resolution images (1920x1080) captured
across various Bangladeshi roads using mobile phone cameras and manually
annotated using LabelImg with YOLO format bounding boxes. Performance
evaluation revealed YOLOv11x as the top performer, achieving 63.7\% mAP@0.5,
43.8\% mAP@0.5:0.95, 61.4\% recall, and 61.6\% F1-score, though requiring 45.8
milliseconds per image for inference. Medium variants (YOLOv8m, YOLOv11m)
struck an optimal balance, delivering robust detection performance with mAP@0.5
values of 62.5\% and 61.8\% respectively, while maintaining moderate inference
times around 14-15 milliseconds. The study identified significant detection
challenges for rare vehicle classes, with Construction Vehicles and Desi
Nosimons showing near-zero accuracy due to dataset imbalances and insufficient
training samples. Confusion matrices revealed frequent misclassifications
between visually similar vehicles, particularly Mini Trucks versus Mini Covered
Vans. This research provides a foundation for developing robust object
detection systems specifically adapted to Bangladesh traffic conditions,
addressing critical needs in autonomous vehicle technology advancement for
developing regions where conventional generic-trained models fail to perform
adequately.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EditIDv2是一个无需调优的解决方案，专门针对高复杂度叙事场景和长文本输入，通过改进ID特征集成模块和最小数据润滑下的可编辑性注入，在保持身份一致性的同时实现深度多层级语义编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有角色编辑方法在简单提示下表现良好，但在面对包含多层语义、时间逻辑和复杂上下文关系的长文本叙事时，往往出现编辑能力下降、语义理解偏差和身份一致性崩溃的问题。

Method: 通过PerceiverAttention的精细分解、引入ID损失和与扩散模型的联合动态训练，以及集成模块的离线融合策略，在最小数据润滑条件下实现可编辑性注入。

Result: 在复杂叙事环境中实现了深度多层级语义编辑，同时保持身份一致性，满足了长提示词和高质量图像生成的需求，在IBench评估中取得了优异结果。

Conclusion: EditIDv2成功解决了长文本叙事场景下的角色编辑挑战，通过创新的技术方法在最小数据需求下实现了高质量的语义编辑和身份保持。

Abstract: We propose EditIDv2, a tuning-free solution specifically designed for
high-complexity narrative scenes and long text inputs. Existing character
editing methods perform well under simple prompts, but often suffer from
degraded editing capabilities, semantic understanding biases, and identity
consistency breakdowns when faced with long text narratives containing multiple
semantic layers, temporal logic, and complex contextual relationships. In
EditID, we analyzed the impact of the ID integration module on editability. In
EditIDv2, we further explore and address the influence of the ID feature
integration module. The core of EditIDv2 is to discuss the issue of editability
injection under minimal data lubrication. Through a sophisticated decomposition
of PerceiverAttention, the introduction of ID loss and joint dynamic training
with the diffusion model, as well as an offline fusion strategy for the
integration module, we achieve deep, multi-level semantic editing while
maintaining identity consistency in complex narrative environments using only a
small amount of data lubrication. This meets the demands of long prompts and
high-quality image generation, and achieves excellent results in the IBench
evaluation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于语言模型的场景图预测方法OOTSM，通过两阶段LLM处理实现对象状态预测和关系生成，在短期和长期预测上均显著提升性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有场景图预测方法主要依赖视觉线索，难以有效整合常识知识，限制了长期预测的鲁棒性。需要显式利用常识知识来更好地理解场景中的对象、概念和关系

Method: 提出语言场景图预测(LSGA)任务，采用面向对象的两阶段方法(OOTSM)：第一阶段LLM预测对象出现和消失，第二阶段生成详细的人-物关系。使用微调的开源LLM并与零样本API方法对比

Result: 在Action Genome基准测试中，短期mean-Recall(@10)提升3.4%，长期mean-Recall(@50)大幅提升21.9%，达到最先进性能

Conclusion: 纯文本方法在场景图预测任务中表现优异，语言模型能够有效利用常识知识进行长期预测，LSGA作为独立任务具有研究价值

Abstract: A scene graph is a structured represention of objects and their relationships
in a scene. Scene Graph Anticipation (SGA) involves predicting future scene
graphs from video clips, enabling applications as intelligent surveillance and
human-machine collaboration. Existing SGA approaches primarily leverage visual
cues, often struggling to integrate valuable commonsense knowledge, thereby
limiting long-term prediction robustness. To explicitly leverage such
commonsense knowledge, we propose a new approach to better understand the
objects, concepts, and relationships in a scene graph. Our approach decouples
the SGA task in two steps: first a scene graph capturing model is used to
convert a video clip into a sequence of scene graphs, then a pure text-based
model is used to predict scene graphs in future frames. Our focus in this work
is on the second step, and we call it Linguistic Scene Graph Anticipation
(LSGA) and believes it should have independent interest beyond the use in SGA
discussed here. For LSGA, we introduce an Object-Oriented Two-Staged Method
(OOTSM) where an Large Language Model (LLM) first forecasts object appearances
and disappearances before generating detailed human-object relations. We
conduct extensive experiments to evaluate OOTSM in two settings. For LSGA, we
evaluate our fine-tuned open-sourced LLMs against zero-shot APIs (i.e., GPT-4o,
GPT-4o-mini, and DeepSeek-V3) on a benchmark constructed from Action Genome
annotations. For SGA, we combine our OOTSM with STTran++ from, and our
experiments demonstrate effective state-of-the-art performance: short-term
mean-Recall (@10) increases by 3.4% while long-term mean-Recall (@50) improves
dramatically by 21.9%. Code is available at https://github.com/ZhuXMMM/OOTSM.

TL;DR: 将高能物理中的pileup噪声抑制原理转化为图像去噪的归纳偏置，提出物理启发的CNN和WIPUNet架构，在高噪声条件下展现出比纯数据驱动模型更好的鲁棒性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受高能粒子物理中pileup噪声抑制策略的启发，希望将物理先验（守恒性、局部性、隔离性）嵌入神经网络架构，提升图像去噪在强噪声下的鲁棒性

Method: 提出层次化的PU-inspired去噪器：带守恒约束的残差CNN、高斯噪声变体，以及将物理先验集成到UNet骨干的WIPUNet架构

Result: 在CIFAR-10和BSD500数据集上，PU-inspired CNN与标准基线相当，WIPUNet在高噪声水平（σ=75,100）下表现出显著优势，证明物理启发先验在强噪声下提供稳定性

Conclusion: 物理启发的归纳偏置能够在不依赖复杂SOTA架构的情况下，显著提升模型在高噪声条件下的鲁棒性，为图像去噪提供了新的物理指导设计思路

Abstract: In high-energy particle physics, collider measurements are contaminated by
"pileup", overlapping soft interactions that obscure the hard-scatter signal of
interest. Dedicated subtraction strategies exploit physical priors such as
conservation, locality, and isolation. Inspired by this analogy, we investigate
how such principles can inform image denoising by embedding physics-guided
inductive biases into neural architectures. This paper is a proof of concept:
rather than targeting state-of-the-art (SOTA) benchmarks, we ask whether
physics-inspired priors improve robustness under strong corruption.
  We introduce a hierarchy of PU-inspired denoisers: a residual CNN with
conservation constraints, its Gaussian-noise variants, and the Weighted
Inductive Pileup-physics-inspired U-Network for Denoising (WIPUNet), which
integrates these ideas into a UNet backbone. On CIFAR-10 with Gaussian noise at
$\sigma\in\{15,25,50,75,100\}$, PU-inspired CNNs are competitive with standard
baselines, while WIPUNet shows a \emph{widening margin} at higher noise.
Complementary BSD500 experiments show the same trend, suggesting
physics-inspired priors provide stability where purely data-driven models
degrade. Our contributions are: (i) translating pileup-mitigation principles
into modular inductive biases; (ii) integrating them into UNet; and (iii)
demonstrating robustness gains at high noise without relying on heavy SOTA
machinery.

Motivation: 当前大语言模型和视觉语言大模型在单轮任务表现出色，但在需要深度上下文理解和复杂视觉推理的多轮交互中存在推理碎片化、上下文丢失和幻觉问题

Method: 提出CAMVR框架，包含视觉-文本上下文记忆单元(VCMU)动态存储管理多模态信息，以及自适应视觉聚焦指导(AVFG)机制动态调整视觉注意力，采用多级推理整合策略

Result: 在VisDial、A-OKVQA和MTIF等挑战性数据集上的广泛实验表明，CAMVR始终达到最先进的性能

Conclusion: CAMVR框架有效解决了多轮视觉语言推理中的关键挑战，为多模态对话系统提供了强大的上下文感知推理能力

Abstract: Current Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs)
excel in single-turn tasks but face significant challenges in multi-turn
interactions requiring deep contextual understanding and complex visual
reasoning, often leading to fragmented reasoning, context loss, and
hallucinations. To address these limitations, we propose Context-Aware
Multi-Turn Visual Reasoning (CAMVR), a novel framework designed to empower
LVLMs with robust and coherent multi-turn visual-textual inference
capabilities. CAMVR introduces two key innovations: a Visual-Textual Context
Memory Unit (VCMU), a dynamic read-write memory network that stores and manages
critical visual features, textual semantic representations, and their
cross-modal correspondences from each interaction turn; and an Adaptive Visual
Focus Guidance (AVFG) mechanism, which leverages the VCMU's context to
dynamically adjust the visual encoder's attention to contextually relevant
image regions. Our multi-level reasoning integration strategy ensures that
response generation is deeply coherent with both current inputs and accumulated
historical context. Extensive experiments on challenging datasets, including
VisDial, an adapted A-OKVQA, and our novel Multi-Turn Instruction Following
(MTIF) dataset, demonstrate that CAMVR consistently achieves state-of-the-art
performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像分割领域的可重复性危机，特别是性能评估中指标实现的可靠性问题。现有开源工具在距离指标实现上存在显著差异，导致结果不一致。

Method: 提出MeshMetrics框架，采用基于网格的方法而非传统的基于网格的方法，通过理论分析和实证验证来精确计算Hausdorff距离和归一化表面距离等指标。

Result: MeshMetrics比现有工具具有更高的准确性和精度，受离散化伪影（如距离量化）的影响显著减小，在相同分割对上Hausdorff距离差异可超过100mm。

Conclusion: MeshMetrics作为一个开源Python包发布，为图像分割评估提供了更可靠的度量实现，有助于改善研究的可重复性。

Abstract: The surge of research in image segmentation has yielded remarkable
performance gains but also exposed a reproducibility crisis. A major
contributor is performance evaluation, where both selection and implementation
of metrics play critical roles. While recent efforts have improved the former,
the reliability of metric implementation has received far less attention.
Pitfalls in distance-based metric implementation can lead to considerable
discrepancies between common open-source tools, for instance, exceeding 100 mm
for the Hausdorff distance and 30%pt for the normalized surface distance for
the same pair of segmentations. To address these pitfalls, we introduce
MeshMetrics, a mesh-based framework that provides a more precise computation of
distance-based metrics than conventional grid-based approaches. Through
theoretical analysis and empirical validation, we demonstrate that MeshMetrics
achieves higher accuracy and precision than established tools, and is
substantially less affected by discretization artifacts, such as distance
quantization. We release MeshMetrics as an open-source Python package,
available at https://github.com/gasperpodobnik/MeshMetrics.

Method: 提出Video-to-Semantic-Tokens模块将原始视频序列转换为离散的语义动作标记，创建可被LVLM理解的"动作叙事"。结合自然语言指令，使用LoRA微调的LVLM（如LLaVA-13B）进行动作分类和语义推理。

Abstract: Human action recognition often struggles with deep semantic understanding,
complex contextual information, and fine-grained distinction, limitations that
traditional methods frequently encounter when dealing with diverse video data.
Inspired by the remarkable capabilities of large language models, this paper
introduces LVLM-VAR, a novel framework that pioneers the application of
pre-trained Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs) to video action recognition,
emphasizing enhanced accuracy and interpretability. Our method features a
Video-to-Semantic-Tokens (VST) Module, which innovatively transforms raw video
sequences into discrete, semantically and temporally consistent "semantic
action tokens," effectively crafting an "action narrative" that is
comprehensible to an LVLM. These tokens, combined with natural language
instructions, are then processed by a LoRA-fine-tuned LVLM (e.g., LLaVA-13B)
for robust action classification and semantic reasoning. LVLM-VAR not only
achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance on challenging
benchmarks such as NTU RGB+D and NTU RGB+D 120, demonstrating significant
improvements (e.g., 94.1% on NTU RGB+D X-Sub and 90.0% on NTU RGB+D 120 X-Set),
but also substantially boosts model interpretability by generating natural
language explanations for its predictions.

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization plays a critical role in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle
(UAV) localization and navigation. However, significant challenges arise from
the drastic viewpoint differences and appearance variations between images.
Existing methods predominantly rely on semantic features from RGB images, often
neglecting the importance of spatial structural information in capturing
viewpoint-invariant features. To address this issue, we incorporate geometric
structural information from normal images and introduce a Joint perception
network to integrate RGB and Normal images (JRN-Geo). Our approach utilizes a
dual-branch feature extraction framework, leveraging a Difference-Aware Fusion
Module (DAFM) and Joint-Constrained Interaction Aggregation (JCIA) strategy to
enable deep fusion and joint-constrained semantic and structural information
representation. Furthermore, we propose a 3D geographic augmentation technique
to generate potential viewpoint variation samples, enhancing the network's
ability to learn viewpoint-invariant features. Extensive experiments on the
University-1652 and SUES-200 datasets validate the robustness of our method
against complex viewpoint ariations, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态传感器融合中的时间不一致性问题，提高下游SLAM任务的鲁棒性和性能

Method: 引入时间嵌入相似性对齐、运动对齐变换损失和窗口时间融合模块，更新模型架构以保持空间结构

Result: 在雷达/声纳到LiDAR转换中表现出更好的时间和空间一致性，降低了绝对轨迹误差，提高了占用地图精度

Conclusion: LiDAR-BIND-T保持了即插即用的模态融合特性，同时显著增强了时间稳定性，为下游SLAM应用提供了更好的性能

Abstract: This paper extends LiDAR-BIND, a modular multi-modal fusion framework that
binds heterogeneous sensors (radar, sonar) to a LiDAR-defined latent space,
with mechanisms that explicitly enforce temporal consistency. We introduce
three contributions: (i) temporal embedding similarity that aligns consecutive
latents, (ii) a motion-aligned transformation loss that matches displacement
between predictions and ground truth LiDAR, and (iii) windows temporal fusion
using a specialised temporal module. We further update the model architecture
to better preserve spatial structure. Evaluations on radar/sonar-to-LiDAR
translation demonstrate improved temporal and spatial coherence, yielding lower
absolute trajectory error and better occupancy map accuracy in
Cartographer-based SLAM (Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping). We propose
different metrics based on the Fr\'echet Video Motion Distance (FVMD) and a
correlation-peak distance metric providing practical temporal quality
indicators to evaluate SLAM performance. The proposed temporal LiDAR-BIND, or
LiDAR-BIND-T, maintains plug-and-play modality fusion while substantially
enhancing temporal stability, resulting in improved robustness and performance
for downstream SLAM.

Conclusion: Multi-LVI-SAM框架通过全景模型和外参补偿方法，有效解决了多相机系统的融合问题，实现了高精度和鲁棒的状态估计

Abstract: We propose a multi-camera LiDAR-visual-inertial odometry framework,
Multi-LVI-SAM, which fuses data from multiple fisheye cameras, LiDAR and
inertial sensors for highly accurate and robust state estimation. To enable
efficient and consistent integration of visual information from multiple
fisheye cameras, we introduce a panoramic visual feature model that unifies
multi-camera observations into a single representation. The panoramic model
serves as a global geometric optimization framework that consolidates
multi-view constraints, enabling seamless loop closure and global pose
optimization, while simplifying system design by avoiding redundant handling of
individual cameras. To address the triangulation inconsistency caused by the
misalignment between each camera's frame and the panoramic model's frame, we
propose an extrinsic compensation method. This method improves feature
consistency across views and significantly reduces triangulation and
optimization errors, leading to more accurate pose estimation. We integrate the
panoramic visual feature model into a tightly coupled LiDAR-visual-inertial
system based on a factor graph. Extensive experiments on public datasets
demonstrate that the panoramic visual feature model enhances the quality and
consistency of multi-camera constraints, resulting in higher accuracy and
robustness than existing multi-camera LiDAR-visual-inertial systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统单图超分辨假设空间不变的降级模型，但真实影像系统存在大气散射、景深变化、透视扭曲等距离依赖效应，需要空间自适应的重建策略。

Method: 提出变分框架将超分辨形式化为空间变化逆问题，通过深度条件卷积核实现离散梯度流动力学，并结合学习的距离适应正则化项来动态调整平滑性约束。

Result: 在5个标准数据集上达到最先进性能，在KITTI户外场景上获得2倍和4倍缩放的36.89/0.9516和30.54/0.8721的PSNR/SSIM指标，分别超过现有方法0.44dB和0.36dB。

Conclusion: 这项工作建立了第一个理论基础坚实的距离自适应超分辨框架，在深度变化场景中显示出显著改进，同时在传统标准上保持竞争力。

Abstract: Single image super-resolution traditionally assumes spatially-invariant
degradation models, yet real-world imaging systems exhibit complex
distance-dependent effects including atmospheric scattering, depth-of-field
variations, and perspective distortions. This fundamental limitation
necessitates spatially-adaptive reconstruction strategies that explicitly
incorporate geometric scene understanding for optimal performance. We propose a
rigorous variational framework that characterizes super-resolution as a
spatially-varying inverse problem, formulating the degradation operator as a
pseudodifferential operator with distance-dependent spectral characteristics
that enable theoretical analysis of reconstruction limits across depth ranges.
Our neural architecture implements discrete gradient flow dynamics through
cascaded residual blocks with depth-conditional convolution kernels, ensuring
convergence to stationary points of the theoretical energy functional while
incorporating learned distance-adaptive regularization terms that dynamically
adjust smoothness constraints based on local geometric structure. Spectral
constraints derived from atmospheric scattering theory prevent bandwidth
violations and noise amplification in far-field regions, while adaptive kernel
generation networks learn continuous mappings from depth to reconstruction
filters. Comprehensive evaluation across five benchmark datasets demonstrates
state-of-the-art performance, achieving 36.89/0.9516 and 30.54/0.8721 PSNR/SSIM
at 2 and 4 scales on KITTI outdoor scenes, outperforming existing methods by
0.44dB and 0.36dB respectively. This work establishes the first
theoretically-grounded distance-adaptive super-resolution framework and
demonstrates significant improvements on depth-variant scenarios while
maintaining competitive performance across traditional benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工作大多只考虑单人或假设两人身体朝向/位置不变，无法准确捕捉日常场景中两人动态、语义一致的长时间交互行为。

Method: 采集了包含241个运动序列的多模态数据集InterAct，并提出分层回归身体动作的扩散方法，以及改进嘴唇准确性的微调机制。

Result: 构建了包含多样化复杂动作和长期交互模式的数据集，并展示了从语音生成两人交互动作的有效方法。

Conclusion: InterAct数据集和方法为研究动态双人交互行为提供了重要基础，推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: We address the problem of accurate capture of interactive behaviors between
two people in daily scenarios. Most previous works either only consider one
person or solely focus on conversational gestures of two people, assuming the
body orientation and/or position of each actor are constant or barely change
over each interaction. In contrast, we propose to simultaneously model two
people's activities, and target objective-driven, dynamic, and semantically
consistent interactions which often span longer duration and cover bigger
space. To this end, we capture a new multi-modal dataset dubbed InterAct, which
is composed of 241 motion sequences where two people perform a realistic and
coherent scenario for one minute or longer over a complete interaction. For
each sequence, two actors are assigned different roles and emotion labels, and
collaborate to finish one task or conduct a common interaction activity. The
audios, body motions, and facial expressions of both persons are captured.
InterAct contains diverse and complex motions of individuals and interesting
and relatively long-term interaction patterns barely seen before. We also
demonstrate a simple yet effective diffusion-based method that estimates
interactive face expressions and body motions of two people from speech inputs.
Our method regresses the body motions in a hierarchical manner, and we also
propose a novel fine-tuning mechanism to improve the lip accuracy of facial
expressions. To facilitate further research, the data and code is made
available at https://hku-cg.github.io/interact/ .

Motivation: 现有的视频对象分割方法在处理复杂组合描述时存在困难，主要挑战在于静态文本与动态视觉内容的对齐，特别是当对象外观相似但运动和姿态不一致时。

Method: 1) 将自然语言查询解析为结构化语义命令；2) 时空定位模块生成所有候选轨迹；3) 分层识别模块通过两阶段推理（粗粒度运动推理和细粒度姿态验证）选择正确目标。

Result: 在Ref-YouTube-VOS、Ref-DAVIS17和MeViS三个主要基准测试中实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: PARSE-VOS通过分层推理框架有效解决了语言描述与动态视频内容的对齐问题，无需训练即可实现准确的视频对象分割。

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment an object of
interest throughout a video based on a language description. The prominent
challenge lies in aligning static text with dynamic visual content,
particularly when objects exhibiting similar appearances with inconsistent
motion and poses. However, current methods often rely on a holistic
visual-language fusion that struggles with complex, compositional descriptions.
In this paper, we propose \textbf{PARSE-VOS}, a novel, training-free framework
powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), for a hierarchical, coarse-to-fine
reasoning across text and video domains. Our approach begins by parsing the
natural language query into structured semantic commands. Next, we introduce a
spatio-temporal grounding module that generates all candidate trajectories for
all potential target objects, guided by the parsed semantics. Finally, a
hierarchical identification module select the correct target through a
two-stage reasoning process: it first performs coarse-grained motion reasoning
with an LLM to narrow down candidates; if ambiguity remains, a fine-grained
pose verification stage is conditionally triggered to disambiguate. The final
output is an accurate segmentation mask for the target object.
\textbf{PARSE-VOS} achieved state-of-the-art performance on three major
benchmarks: Ref-YouTube-VOS, Ref-DAVIS17, and MeViS.

Conclusion: PictOBI-20k数据集可为未来甲骨文导向的LMM的视觉注意力评估和优化提供支持，促进甲骨文视觉解读技术的发展。

Abstract: Deciphering oracle bone characters (OBCs), the oldest attested form of
written Chinese, has remained the ultimate, unwavering goal of scholars,
offering an irreplaceable key to understanding humanity's early modes of
production. Current decipherment methodologies of OBC are primarily constrained
by the sporadic nature of archaeological excavations and the limited corpus of
inscriptions. With the powerful visual perception capability of large
multimodal models (LMMs), the potential of using LMMs for visually deciphering
OBCs has increased. In this paper, we introduce PictOBI-20k, a dataset designed
to evaluate LMMs on the visual decipherment tasks of pictographic OBCs. It
includes 20k meticulously collected OBC and real object images, forming over
15k multi-choice questions. We also conduct subjective annotations to
investigate the consistency of the reference point between humans and LMMs in
visual reasoning. Experiments indicate that general LMMs possess preliminary
visual decipherment skills, and LMMs are not effectively using visual
information, while most of the time they are limited by language priors. We
hope that our dataset can facilitate the evaluation and optimization of visual
attention in future OBC-oriented LMMs. The code and dataset will be available
at https://github.com/OBI-Future/PictOBI-20k.

Conclusion: 该方法为医学形态重建提供了一种高效的姿态对齐解决方案，具有广泛的插入式应用潜力，可以容易集成到现有的重建管道中。

Abstract: In medical imaging, point distribution models are often used to reconstruct
and complete partial shapes using a statistical model of the full shape. A
commonly overlooked, but crucial factor in this reconstruction process, is the
pose of the training data relative to the partial target shape. A difference in
pose alignment of the training and target shape leads to biased solutions,
particularly when observing small parts of a shape. In this paper, we
demonstrate the importance of pose alignment for partial shape reconstructions
and propose an efficient method to adjust an existing model to a specific
target. Our method preserves the computational efficiency of linear models
while significantly improving reconstruction accuracy and predicted variance.
It exactly recovers the intended aligned model for translations, and provides a
good approximation for small rotations, all without access to the original
training data. Hence, existing shape models in reconstruction pipelines can be
adapted by a simple preprocessing step, making our approach widely applicable
in plug-and-play scenarios.

Abstract: PointPillars is the fastest 3D object detector that exploits pseudo image
representations to encode features for 3D objects in a scene. Albeit efficient,
PointPillars is typically outperformed by state-of-the-art 3D detection methods
due to the following limitations: 1) The pseudo image representations fail to
preserve precise 3D structures, and 2) they make it difficult to adopt a
two-stage detection pipeline using 3D object proposals that typically shows
better performance than a single-stage approach. We introduce in this paper the
first two-stage 3D detection framework exploiting pseudo image representations,
narrowing the performance gaps between PointPillars and state-of-the-art
methods, while retaining its efficiency. Our framework consists of two novel
components that overcome the aforementioned limitations of PointPillars: First,
we introduce a new CNN architecture, dubbed 3DPillars, that enables learning 3D
voxel-based features from the pseudo image representation efficiently using 2D
convolutions. The basic idea behind 3DPillars is that 3D features from voxels
can be viewed as a stack of pseudo images. To implement this idea, we propose a
separable voxel feature module that extracts voxel-based features without using
3D convolutions. Second, we introduce an RoI head with a sparse scene context
feature module that aggregates multi-scale features from 3DPillars to obtain a
sparse scene feature. This enables adopting a two-stage pipeline effectively,
and fully leveraging contextual information of a scene to refine 3D object
proposals. Experimental results on the KITTI and Waymo Open datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach, achieving a good
compromise in terms of speed and accuracy.

Conclusion: CRAB模型通过有效融合相机和雷达信息，成功解决了深度模糊问题，在3D目标检测任务中表现出色

Abstract: Recently, camera-radar fusion-based 3D object detection methods in bird's eye
view (BEV) have gained attention due to the complementary characteristics and
cost-effectiveness of these sensors. Previous approaches using forward
projection struggle with sparse BEV feature generation, while those employing
backward projection overlook depth ambiguity, leading to false positives. In
this paper, to address the aforementioned limitations, we propose a novel
camera-radar fusion-based 3D object detection and segmentation model named CRAB
(Camera-Radar fusion for reducing depth Ambiguity in Backward projection-based
view transformation), using a backward projection that leverages radar to
mitigate depth ambiguity. During the view transformation, CRAB aggregates
perspective view image context features into BEV queries. It improves depth
distinction among queries along the same ray by combining the dense but
unreliable depth distribution from images with the sparse yet precise depth
information from radar occupancy. We further introduce spatial cross-attention
with a feature map containing radar context information to enhance the
comprehension of the 3D scene. When evaluated on the nuScenes open dataset, our
proposed approach achieves a state-of-the-art performance among backward
projection-based camera-radar fusion methods with 62.4\% NDS and 54.0\% mAP in
3D object detection.

Abstract: Automating visual inspection in medical device manufacturing remains
challenging due to small and imbalanced datasets, high-resolution imagery, and
stringent regulatory requirements. This work proposes two attention-guided
autoencoder architectures for deep anomaly detection designed to address these
constraints. The first employs a structural similarity-based anomaly score
(4-MS-SSIM), offering lightweight and accurate real-time defect detection,
yielding ACC 0.903 (unsupervised thresholding) and 0.931 (supervised
thresholding) on the - Surface Seal Image - Test split with only 10% of
defective samples. The second applies a feature-distance approach using
Mahalanobis scoring on reduced latent features, providing high sensitivity to
distributional shifts for supervisory monitoring, achieving ACC 0.722 with
supervised thresholding. Together, these methods deliver complementary
capabilities: the first supports reliable inline inspection, while the second
enables scalable post-production surveillance and regulatory compliance
monitoring. Experimental results demonstrate that both approaches surpass
re-implemented baselines and provide a practical pathway for deploying deep
anomaly detection in regulated manufacturing environments, aligning accuracy,
efficiency, and the regulatory obligations defined for high-risk AI systems
under the EU AI Act.

Result: 在LIDC-IDRI肺结节数据集上评估显示，Probabilistic SAM能够产生与专家分歧一致的多样化输出，在不确定性感知指标上优于现有概率基线方法。

Conclusion: Probabilistic SAM成功扩展了SAM的概率能力，能够有效处理医学图像分割中的不确定性，为不确定性感知的分割输出提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in promptable segmentation, such as the Segment Anything
Model (SAM), have enabled flexible, high-quality mask generation across a wide
range of visual domains. However, SAM and similar models remain fundamentally
deterministic, producing a single segmentation per object per prompt, and fail
to capture the inherent ambiguity present in many real-world tasks. This
limitation is particularly troublesome in medical imaging, where multiple
plausible segmentations may exist due to annotation uncertainty or inter-expert
variability. In this paper, we introduce Probabilistic SAM, a probabilistic
extension of SAM that models a distribution over segmentations conditioned on
both the input image and prompt. By incorporating a latent variable space and
training with a variational objective, our model learns to generate diverse and
plausible segmentation masks reflecting the variability in human annotations.
The architecture integrates a prior and posterior network into the SAM
framework, allowing latent codes to modulate the prompt embeddings during
inference. The latent space allows for efficient sampling during inference,
enabling uncertainty-aware outputs with minimal overhead. We evaluate
Probabilistic SAM on the public LIDC-IDRI lung nodule dataset and demonstrate
its ability to produce diverse outputs that align with expert disagreement,
outperforming existing probabilistic baselines on uncertainty-aware metrics.

Abstract: Vulnerable road users (VRUs) such as pedestrians, cyclists, and motorcyclists
represent more than half of global traffic deaths, yet their detection remains
challenging in poor lighting, adverse weather, and unbalanced data sets. This
paper presents a multimodal detection framework that integrates RGB and thermal
infrared imaging with a fine-tuned YOLOv8 model. Training leveraged KITTI,
BDD100K, and Teledyne FLIR datasets, with class re-weighting and light
augmentations to improve minority-class performance and robustness, experiments
show that 640-pixel resolution and partial backbone freezing optimise accuracy

Results highlight that thermal models achieve the highest precision, and
RGB-to-thermal augmentation boosts recall, demonstrating the potential of
multimodal detection to improve VRU safety at intersections.

Motivation: 沙尘暴对健康和能见度造成害处，需要从占米图像中快速检测沙尘现象以提供及时预警。

Method: 使用3D卷积网络处理NASA Terra和Aqua占米的MODIS多波段图像（包括所有36个波段和分割的热波段），通过学习空间和波段模式来区分沙尘、云层和表面特征。使用简单的标准化和本地填充处理缺失数据。

Conclusion: 结合波段和空间学习可以在全球范围内提供及时的沙尘预警。使用更宽的输入窗口或基于注意力机制的模型可能进一步提高边缘检测的准确性。

Abstract: Dust storms harm health and reduce visibility; quick detection from
satellites is needed. We present a near real-time system that flags dust at the
pixel level using multi-band images from NASA's Terra and Aqua (MODIS). A 3D
convolutional network learns patterns across all 36 bands, plus split thermal
bands, to separate dust from clouds and surface features. Simple normalization
and local filling handle missing data. An improved version raises training
speed by 21x and supports fast processing of full scenes. On 17 independent
MODIS scenes, the model reaches about 0.92 accuracy with a mean squared error
of 0.014. Maps show strong agreement in plume cores, with most misses along
edges. These results show that joint band-and-space learning can provide timely
dust alerts at global scale; using wider input windows or attention-based

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高速量解释机器人收集的海底视觉图像可以提高海洋监测和探索的效率。虽然最近的研究已经说明位置元数据可以增强自监督特征学习，但其在不同的SSL策略、模型和海底图像数据集中的好处尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 这项研究评估了基于位置的正则化对六种最先进的SSL框架的影响，这些框架包括具有不同隐藏空间维度的卷积神经网络(CNN)和视觉变换器(ViT)模型。在三个多样的海底图像数据集上进行了评估。

Result: 位置正则化持续地在下游分类性能上超过了标准SSL，CNN模型的平均F1分数提升了4.9±4.0%，ViT模型提升了6.3±8.9%。位置正则化的SSL在高维和低维隐藏表征上分别比预训练模型提高了2.7±2.7%和10.1±9.4%。

Conclusion: 研究结果突出了位置元数据对SSL正则化的价值，尤其是在使用低维隐藏表征时，并证明了高维ViT模型在海底图像分析中的强大泛化能力。

Abstract: High-throughput interpretation of robotically gathered seafloor visual
imagery can increase the efficiency of marine monitoring and exploration.
Although recent research has suggested that location metadata can enhance
self-supervised feature learning (SSL), its benefits across different SSL
strategies, models and seafloor image datasets are underexplored. This study
evaluates the impact of location-based regularisation on six state-of-the-art
SSL frameworks, which include Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision
Transformer (ViT) models with varying latent-space dimensionality. Evaluation
across three diverse seafloor image datasets finds that location-regularisation
consistently improves downstream classification performance over standard SSL,
with average F1-score gains of $4.9 \pm 4.0%$ for CNNs and $6.3 \pm 8.9%$ for
ViTs, respectively. While CNNs pretrained on generic datasets benefit from
high-dimensional latent representations, dataset-optimised SSL achieves similar
performance across the high (512) and low (128) dimensional latent
representations. Location-regularised SSL improves CNN performance over
pre-trained models by $2.7 \pm 2.7%$ and $10.1 \pm 9.4%$ for high and
low-dimensional latent representations, respectively. For ViTs,
high-dimensionality benefits both pre-trained and dataset-optimised SSL.
Although location-regularisation improves SSL performance compared to standard
SSL methods, pre-trained ViTs show strong generalisation, matching the
best-performing location-regularised SSL with F1-scores of $0.795 \pm 0.075$
and $0.795 \pm 0.077$, respectively. The findings highlight the value of
location metadata for SSL regularisation, particularly when using
low-dimensional latent representations, and demonstrate strong generalisation
of high-dimensional ViTs for seafloor image analysis.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of carotid artery structures in histopathological
images is vital for advancing cardiovascular disease research and diagnosis.
However, deep learning model development in this domain is constrained by the
scarcity of annotated cardiovascular histopathological data. This study
investigates a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art deep learning
segmentation models, including convolutional neural networks (U-Net,
DeepLabV3+), a Vision Transformer (SegFormer), and recent foundation models
(SAM, MedSAM, MedSAM+UNet), on a limited dataset of cardiovascular histology
images. Despite employing an extensive hyperparameter optimization strategy
with Bayesian search, our findings reveal that model performance is highly
sensitive to data splits, with minor differences driven more by statistical
noise than by true algorithmic superiority. This instability exposes the
limitations of standard benchmarking practices in low-data clinical settings
and challenges the assumption that performance rankings reflect meaningful
clinical utility.

Conclusion: OCF框架具有优秀的聚类能力和路径变化稳健性，适合生成调查数据摘要和支持长期持久自主海洋探索中的信息化路径规划

Abstract: As long-endurance and seafloor-resident AUVs become more capable, there is an
increasing need for extended, real-time interpretation of seafloor imagery to
enable adaptive missions and optimise communication efficiency. Although
offline image analysis methods are well established, they rely on access to
complete datasets and human-labelled examples to manage the strong influence of
environmental and operational conditions on seafloor image
appearance-requirements that cannot be met in real-time settings. To address
this, we introduce an online clustering framework (OCF) capable of interpreting
seafloor imagery without supervision, which is designed to operate in real-time
on continuous data streams in a scalable, adaptive, and self-consistent manner.
The method enables the efficient review and consolidation of common patterns
across the entire data history in constant time by identifying and maintaining
a set of representative samples that capture the evolving feature distribution,
supporting dynamic cluster merging and splitting without reprocessing the full
image history. We evaluate the framework on three diverse seafloor image
datasets, analysing the impact of different representative sampling strategies
on both clustering accuracy and computational cost. The OCF achieves the
highest average F1 score of 0.68 across the three datasets among all
comparative online clustering approaches, with a standard deviation of 3%
across three distinct survey trajectories, demonstrating its superior
clustering capability and robustness to trajectory variation. In addition, it
maintains consistently lower and bounded computational time as the data volume
increases. These properties are beneficial for generating survey data summaries
and supporting informative path planning in long-term, persistent autonomous
marine exploration.

Result: 实验结果表明BTCChat在变化描述和视觉问答任务上达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: BTCChat通过专门设计的变化理解模块有效解决了双时相图像分析中的关键挑战，为遥感图像分析提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Bi-temporal satellite imagery supports critical applications such as urban
development monitoring and disaster assessment. Although powerful multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) have been applied in bi-temporal change analysis,
previous methods process image pairs through direct concatenation, inadequately
modeling temporal correlations and spatial semantic changes. This deficiency
hampers visual-semantic alignment in change understanding, thereby constraining
the overall effectiveness of current approaches. To address this gap, we
propose BTCChat, a multi-temporal MLLM with advanced bi-temporal change
understanding capability. BTCChat supports bi-temporal change captioning and
retains single-image interpretation capability. To better capture temporal
features and spatial semantic changes in image pairs, we design a Change
Extraction module. Moreover, to enhance the model's attention to spatial
details, we introduce a Prompt Augmentation mechanism, which incorporates
contextual clues into the prompt to enhance model performance. Experimental
results demonstrate that BTCChat achieves state-of-the-art performance on
change captioning and visual question answering tasks.

Abstract: Uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly deployed in forest
environments for tasks such as environmental monitoring and search and rescue,
which require safe navigation through dense foliage and precise data
collection. Traditional sensing approaches, including passive multispectral and
RGB imaging, suffer from latency, poor depth resolution, and strong dependence
on ambient light - especially under forest canopies. In this work, we present a
novel event spectroscopy system that simultaneously enables high-resolution,
low-latency depth reconstruction and multispectral imaging using a single
sensor. Depth is reconstructed using structured light, and by modulating the
wavelength of the projected structured light, our system captures spectral
information in controlled bands between 650 nm and 850 nm. We demonstrate up to
$60\%$ improvement in RMSE over commercial depth sensors and validate the
spectral accuracy against a reference spectrometer and commercial multispectral
cameras, demonstrating comparable performance. A portable version limited to
RGB (3 wavelengths) is used to collect real-world depth and spectral data from
a Masoala Rainforest. We demonstrate the use of this prototype for color image
reconstruction and material differentiation between leaves and branches using
spectral and depth data. Our results show that adding depth (available at no
extra effort with our setup) to material differentiation improves the accuracy
by over $30\%$ compared to color-only method. Our system, tested in both lab
and real-world rainforest environments, shows strong performance in depth
estimation, RGB reconstruction, and material differentiation - paving the way
for lightweight, integrated, and robust UAV perception and data collection in
complex natural environments.

Abstract: Musculoskeletal disorders pose significant risks to athletes, and assessing
risk early is important for prevention. However, most existing methods are
designed for controlled settings and fail to reliably assess risk in complex
environments due to their reliance on a single type of data. This research
proposes ViSK-GAT (Visual-Skeletal Geometric Attention Transformer), a novel
multimodal deep learning framework designed to classify musculoskeletal risk
using visual and skeletal coordinate-based features. In addition, a custom
multimodal dataset is constructed by combining visual data and skeletal
coordinates for risk assessment. Each sample is labeled into eight risk
categories based on the Rapid Entire Body Assessment system. ViSK-GAT combines
a Residual Block with a Lightweight Transformer Block to learn spatial and
temporal dependencies jointly. It incorporates two novel modules: the
Fine-Grained Attention Module (FGAM), which enables precise inter-modal feature
refinement through cross-attention between visual and skeletal inputs, and the
Multimodal Geometric Correspondence Module (MGCM), which enhances cross-modal
coherence by aligning image features with coordinate-based representations.
ViSK-GAT achieved strong performance with validation and test accuracies of
93.55\% and 93.89\%, respectively; a precision of 93.86\%; an F1 score of
93.85\%; and Cohen's Kappa and Matthews Correlation Coefficient of 93\%. The
regression results also indicated a low Root Mean Square Error of the predicted
probability distribution of 0.1205 and a corresponding Mean Absolute Error of
0.0156. Compared to nine popular transfer learning backbones, ViSK-GAT
consistently outperformed previous methods. The ViSK-GAT model advances
artificial intelligence implementation and application, transforming
musculoskeletal risk classification and enabling impactful early interventions
in sports.

Conclusion: 该方法为语义压缩提供了新范式，在极低比特率下实现了优秀的语义保存和跨任务鲁棒性

Abstract: Recent deep learning-based methods for lossy image compression achieve
competitive rate-distortion performance through extensive end-to-end training
and advanced architectures. However, emerging applications increasingly
prioritize semantic preservation over pixel-level reconstruction and demand
robust performance across diverse data distributions and downstream tasks.
These challenges call for advanced semantic compression paradigms. Motivated by
the zero-shot and representational capabilities of multimodal foundation
models, we propose a novel semantic compression method based on the contrastive
language-image pretraining (CLIP) model. Rather than compressing images for
reconstruction, we propose compressing the CLIP feature embeddings into minimal
bits while preserving semantic information across different tasks. Experiments
show that our method maintains semantic integrity across benchmark datasets,
achieving an average bit rate of approximately 2-3* 10(-3) bits per pixel. This
is less than 5% of the bitrate required by mainstream image compression
approaches for comparable performance. Remarkably, even under extreme
compression, the proposed approach exhibits zero-shot robustness across diverse
data distributions and downstream tasks.

Conclusion: 该方法使视觉语言预训练模型成为现实世界实施的更可行解决方案，通过层次化视觉信息和细粒度对齐显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: The evolution of prompt learning methodologies has driven exploration of
deeper prompt designs to enhance model performance. However, current deep text
prompting approaches suffer from two critical limitations: Over-reliance on
constrastive learning objectives that prioritize high-level semantic alignment,
neglecting fine-grained feature optimization; Static prompts across all input
categories, preventing content-aware adaptation. To address these limitations,
we propose AttriPrompt-a novel framework that enhances and refines textual
semantic representations by leveraging the intermediate-layer features of
CLIP's vision encoder. We designed an Attribute Retrieval module that first
clusters visual features from each layer. The aggregated visual features
retrieve semantically similar prompts from a prompt pool, which are then
concatenated to the input of every layer in the text encoder. Leveraging
hierarchical visual information embedded in prompted text features, we
introduce Dual-stream Contrastive Learning to realize fine-grained alignment.
Furthermore, we introduce a Self-Regularization mechanism by applying explicit
regularization constraints between the prompted and non-prompted text features
to prevent overfitting on limited training data. Extensive experiments across
three benchmarks demonstrate AttriPrompt's superiority over state-of-the-art
methods, achieving up to 7.37\% improvement in the base-to-novel setting. The
observed strength of our method in cross-domain knowledge transfer positions
vision-language pre-trained models as more viable solutions for real-world
implementation.

Motivation: 传统的SDE采样方法在Flow Matching模型中会引入明显的噪声伪影，这对奖励学习过程有害，需要一种更好的采样方法来消除这些噪声。

Conclusion: CPS方法有效解决了SDE采样的噪声问题，为强化学习在Flow Matching模型中的应用提供了更好的基础。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has recently emerged as a powerful technique for
improving image and video generation in Diffusion and Flow Matching models,
specifically for enhancing output quality and alignment with prompts. A
critical step for applying online RL methods on Flow Matching is the
introduction of stochasticity into the deterministic framework, commonly
realized by Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE). Our investigation reveals a
significant drawback to this approach: SDE-based sampling introduces pronounced
noise artifacts in the generated images, which we found to be detrimental to
the reward learning process. A rigorous theoretical analysis traces the origin
of this noise to an excess of stochasticity injected during inference. To
address this, we draw inspiration from Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models
(DDIM) to reformulate the sampling process. Our proposed method,
Coefficients-Preserving Sampling (CPS), eliminates these noise artifacts. This
leads to more accurate reward modeling, ultimately enabling faster and more
stable convergence for reinforcement learning-based optimizers like Flow-GRPO
and Dance-GRPO. Code will be released at https://github.com/IamCreateAI/FlowCPS

Conclusion: 所提出的DIFM能够有效利用原始和增强图像的互补信息，多尺度边界损失提高了边界分割精度，为医学图像分割提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is a crucial method for assisting professionals in
diagnosing various diseases through medical imaging. However, various factors
such as noise, blurriness, and low contrast often hinder the accurate diagnosis
of diseases. While numerous image enhancement techniques can mitigate these
issues, they may also alter crucial information needed for accurate diagnosis
in the original image. Conventional image fusion strategies, such as feature
concatenation can address this challenge. However, they struggle to fully
leverage the advantages of both original and enhanced images while suppressing
the side effects of the enhancements. To overcome the problem, we propose a
dual interactive fusion module (DIFM) that effectively exploits mutual
complementary information from the original and enhanced images. DIFM employs
cross-attention bidirectionally to simultaneously attend to corresponding
spatial information across different images, subsequently refining the
complementary features via global spatial attention. This interaction leverages
low- to high-level features implicitly associated with diverse structural
attributes like edges, blobs, and object shapes, resulting in enhanced features
that embody important spatial characteristics. In addition, we introduce a
multi-scale boundary loss based on gradient extraction to improve segmentation
accuracy at object boundaries. Experimental results on the ACDC and Synapse
datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method quantitatively and
qualitatively. Code available at: https://github.com/JJeong-Gari/DIN

Result: 在KITTI数据集上，仅用0.65M参数就达到79.97% mAP的汽车检测精度，比PointPillars基准方法减少7倍参数，优于最近的轻量级和知识蒸馏方法。

Conclusion: StripDet为边缘设备上的实际3D检测提供了一个实用的解决方案，实现了优异的精度-效率权衡。

Abstract: The deployment of high-accuracy 3D object detection models from point cloud
remains a significant challenge due to their substantial computational and
memory requirements. To address this, we introduce StripDet, a novel
lightweight framework designed for on-device efficiency. First, we propose the
novel Strip Attention Block (SAB), a highly efficient module designed to
capture long-range spatial dependencies. By decomposing standard 2D
convolutions into asymmetric strip convolutions, SAB efficiently extracts
directional features while reducing computational complexity from quadratic to
linear. Second, we design a hardware-friendly hierarchical backbone that
integrates SAB with depthwise separable convolutions and a simple multiscale
fusion strategy, achieving end-to-end efficiency. Extensive experiments on the
KITTI dataset validate StripDet's superiority. With only 0.65M parameters, our
model achieves a 79.97% mAP for car detection, surpassing the baseline
PointPillars with a 7x parameter reduction. Furthermore, StripDet outperforms
recent lightweight and knowledge distillation-based methods, achieving a
superior accuracy-efficiency trade-off while establishing itself as a practical
solution for real-world 3D detection on edge devices.

Motivation: 传统灵光渲染技术需多次模糊和素材采样，包含条件分支，占用大量执行时间，是实时渲染的急需解决的急需解决的问题

Method: 提出两种神经网络基灵光方法：Neural Bloom Lighting (NBL) 和 Fast Neural Bloom Lighting (FastNBL)，重点关注质量和性能

Result: 在多种3D场景中进行测试，FastNBL比标准方法快28%，NBL快12%，同时保持高质量灵光效果

Conclusion: 该方法能够更快地实现现实灵光效果，节省计算资源，推动实时环境向更高实体性发展，对于维持高FPS环境下的沉浸式体验至关重要

Abstract: We propose a novel method to generate bloom lighting effect in real time
using neural networks. Our solution generate brightness mask from given 3D
scene view up to 30% faster than state-of-the-art methods. The existing
traditional techniques rely on multiple blur appliances and texture sampling,
also very often have existing conditional branching in its implementation.
These operations occupy big portion of the execution time. We solve this
problem by proposing two neural network-based bloom lighting methods, Neural
Bloom Lighting (NBL) and Fast Neural Bloom Lighting (FastNBL), focusing on
their quality and performance. Both methods were tested on a variety of 3D
scenes, with evaluations conducted on brightness mask accuracy and inference
speed. The main contribution of this work is that both methods produce
high-quality bloom effects while outperforming the standard state-of-the-art
bloom implementation, with FastNBL being faster by 28% and NBL faster by 12%.
These findings highlight that we can achieve realistic bloom lighting phenomena
faster, moving us towards more realism in real-time environments in the future.
This improvement saves computational resources, which is a major bottleneck in
real-time rendering. Furthermore, it is crucial for sustaining immersion and
ensuring smooth experiences in high FPS environments, while maintaining
high-quality realism.

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对医学3D影像的自监督学习方法，通过三个子任务捕获空间相关语义，提高模型的可解释性，同时保持与现有方法相当的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医学可视化任务中自监督学习大多借鉴2D视觉领域设计，缺乏对3D空间知识学习过程的直观展示，医学可解释性不足。

Method: 设计了三个遵循可观察原则的子任务来捕获医学3D影像中的空间相关语义，利用3D影像额外维度提供的增强语义深度，结合多粒度空间关系建模来保持训练稳定性。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法能够提供与当前方法相当的性能，同时促进对自监督学习过程的直观理解。

Conclusion: 该方法通过精心设计的子任务在保持性能的同时显著提升了医学3D影像自监督学习的可解释性，为医疗领域的模型理解提供了有效途径。

Abstract: The application of self-supervised techniques has become increasingly
prevalent within medical visualization tasks, primarily due to its capacity to
mitigate the data scarcity prevalent in the healthcare sector. The majority of
current works are influenced by designs originating in the generic 2D visual
domain, which lack the intuitive demonstration of the model's learning process
regarding 3D spatial knowledge. Consequently, these methods often fall short in
terms of medical interpretability. We propose a method consisting of three
sub-tasks to capture the spatially relevant semantics in medical 3D imaging.
Their design adheres to observable principles to ensure interpretability, and
minimize the performance loss caused thereby as much as possible. By leveraging
the enhanced semantic depth offered by the extra dimension in 3D imaging, this
approach incorporates multi-granularity spatial relationship modeling to
maintain training stability. Experimental findings suggest that our approach is
capable of delivering performance that is on par with current methodologies,
while facilitating an intuitive understanding of the self-supervised learning
process.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniStyle2通过去风格化方法构建大规模数据集DST-100K，训练出基于FLUX.1-dev的前馈模型，在艺术风格迁移任务中超越现有最优方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决艺术风格迁移中缺乏真实监督数据的基本挑战，通过去风格化方法获得风格-内容对齐的真实监督信号

Method: 1) 开发DST文本引导去风格化模型重建无风格内容；2) 使用多阶段评估模型DST-Filter自动筛选高质量数据对；3) 基于DST-100K数据集训练FLUX.1-dev前馈模型

Result: OmniStyle2在定性和定量基准测试中一致超越最先进方法

Conclusion: 通过去风格化的可扩展数据生成提供了可靠的监督范式，克服了艺术风格迁移中缺乏真实数据的基本挑战

Abstract: OmniStyle2 introduces a novel approach to artistic style transfer by
reframing it as a data problem. Our key insight is destylization, reversing
style transfer by removing stylistic elements from artworks to recover natural,
style-free counterparts. This yields DST-100K, a large-scale dataset that
provides authentic supervision signals by aligning real artistic styles with
their underlying content. To build DST-100K, we develop (1) DST, a text-guided
destylization model that reconstructs stylefree content, and (2) DST-Filter, a
multi-stage evaluation model that employs Chain-of-Thought reasoning to
automatically discard low-quality pairs while ensuring content fidelity and
style accuracy. Leveraging DST-100K, we train OmniStyle2, a simple feed-forward
model based on FLUX.1-dev. Despite its simplicity, OmniStyle2 consistently
surpasses state-of-the-art methods across both qualitative and quantitative
benchmarks. Our results demonstrate that scalable data generation via
destylization provides a reliable supervision paradigm, overcoming the
fundamental challenge posed by the lack of ground-truth data in artistic style
transfer.

TL;DR: ConstStyle提出了一种新的领域泛化方法，通过将训练和测试数据映射到统一域来减少域偏移影响，在有限训练域和大域差距情况下显著提升性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度神经网络在测试数据分布与训练数据不同时的性能下降问题，传统方法在处理有限训练域或大域差距时效果有限

Method: 使用统一域捕获域不变特征并桥接域差距，训练时将样本映射到优化后的统一域，测试时类似投影后再进行预测

Result: 在多种场景下一致优于现有方法，当只有有限可见域时，准确率比次优方法提升高达19.82%

Conclusion: ConstStyle通过统一域对齐有效减少了域偏移的影响，即使在大域差距或少量可见域情况下也能显著提升领域泛化性能

Abstract: Deep neural networks often suffer performance drops when test data
distribution differs from training data. Domain Generalization (DG) aims to
address this by focusing on domain-invariant features or augmenting data for
greater diversity. However, these methods often struggle with limited training
domains or significant gaps between seen (training) and unseen (test) domains.
To enhance DG robustness, we hypothesize that it is essential for the model to
be trained on data from domains that closely resemble unseen test domains-an
inherently difficult task due to the absence of prior knowledge about the
unseen domains. Accordingly, we propose ConstStyle, a novel approach that
leverages a unified domain to capture domain-invariant features and bridge the
domain gap with theoretical analysis. During training, all samples are mapped
onto this unified domain, optimized for seen domains. During testing, unseen
domain samples are projected similarly before predictions. By aligning both
training and testing data within this unified domain, ConstStyle effectively
reduces the impact of domain shifts, even with large domain gaps or few seen
domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ConstStyle consistently
outperforms existing methods across diverse scenarios. Notably, when only a
limited number of seen domains are available, ConstStyle can boost accuracy up
to 19.82\% compared to the next best approach.

Motivation: 扩散模型在图像处理任务中表现出强大的生成能力，但需要针对稀疏视图CT重建的特殊需求进行优化，以有效完成缺失投影视图并保持结构一致性。

Method: 提出时间变化稀疏条件重加权引导策略，动态调整去噪过程中的权重；采用线性回归校正分布偏移；构建双网络并行架构进行全局校正和多子频率组件优化。

Result: 在公共和真实数据集上，PSNR提升2.58dB，SSIM提高2.37%，MSE降低0.236，在结构一致性、细节恢复和伪影抑制方面表现出优异的泛化性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: STRIDE方法通过创新的条件引导策略和网络架构设计，成功实现了高质量的稀疏视图CT图像重建，在多个指标上显著优于现有最佳基线方法。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable generative capabilities in
image processing tasks. We propose a Sparse condition Temporal Rewighted
Integrated Distribution Estimation guided diffusion model (STRIDE) for
sparse-view CT reconstruction. Specifically, we design a joint training
mechanism guided by sparse conditional probabilities to facilitate the model
effective learning of missing projection view completion and global information
modeling. Based on systematic theoretical analysis, we propose a temporally
varying sparse condition reweighting guidance strategy to dynamically adjusts
weights during the progressive denoising process from pure noise to the real
image, enabling the model to progressively perceive sparse-view information.
The linear regression is employed to correct distributional shifts between
known and generated data, mitigating inconsistencies arising during the
guidance process. Furthermore, we construct a dual-network parallel
architecture to perform global correction and optimization across multiple
sub-frequency components, thereby effectively improving the model capability in
both detail restoration and structural preservation, ultimately achieving
high-quality image reconstruction. Experimental results on both public and real
datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves the best improvement of
2.58 dB in PSNR, increase of 2.37\% in SSIM, and reduction of 0.236 in MSE
compared to the best-performing baseline methods. The reconstructed images
exhibit excellent generalization and robustness in terms of structural
consistency, detail restoration, and artifact suppression.

Motivation: 单目3D物体检测因缺乏深度线索而具有挑战性，现有方案主要依靠RGB图像特征，需要探索如何通过额外信息来提升检测效果

Method: 提出解耦合策略，将预计算的分割信息优先级注入并融合到特征空间中，用于导向3D检测，无需扩大检测模型或聚合学习分割优先级

Result: 在KITTI 3D物体检测测试集上表现优异，在小物体（行人和自行车驾驶员）上超过仅依赖RGB图像特征的等效架构

Conclusion: 证明了解输入数据可以平衡对额外传感器或训练数据的需求，分割信息的注入能够有效提升单目3D检测的性能

Abstract: Monocular 3D Object Detection represents a challenging Computer Vision task
due to the nature of the input used, which is a single 2D image, lacking in any
depth cues and placing the depth estimation problem as an ill-posed one.
Existing solutions leverage the information extracted from the input by using
Convolutional Neural Networks or Transformer architectures as feature
extraction backbones, followed by specific detection heads for 3D parameters
prediction. In this paper, we introduce a decoupled strategy based on injecting
precomputed segmentation information priors and fusing them directly into the
feature space for guiding the detection, without expanding the detection model
or jointly learning the priors. The focus is on evaluating the impact of
additional segmentation information on existing detection pipelines without
adding additional prediction branches. The proposed method is evaluated on the
KITTI 3D Object Detection Benchmark, outperforming the equivalent architecture
that relies only on RGB image features for small objects in the scene:
pedestrians and cyclists, and proving that understanding the input data can
balance the need for additional sensors or training data.

Motivation: 现有单影像位置估计方法忽视了空间作业中的时序信息，需要利用动态信息提高估计精度

Method: 结合ViT编码器的图像特征和预训练光流模型的运动线索，通过动态感知热力图定位2D关键点，使用PnP法求解6-DoF位置

Result: 在SPADES-RGB数据集上表现超过单影像基线方法，2D关键点定位和6-DoF位置估计都有显著改善，并在SPARK-2024数据集上显示良好的过渡性能

Conclusion: 集成动态信息的深度学习框架能够有效提升单目计算机器人位置估计的性能，具有较好的通用性和过渡性能

Abstract: Monocular 6-DoF pose estimation plays an important role in multiple
spacecraft missions. Most existing pose estimation approaches rely on single
images with static keypoint localisation, failing to exploit valuable temporal
information inherent to space operations. In this work, we adapt a deep
learning framework from human pose estimation to the spacecraft pose estimation
domain that integrates motion-aware heatmaps and optical flow to capture motion
dynamics. Our approach combines image features from a Vision Transformer (ViT)
encoder with motion cues from a pre-trained optical flow model to localise 2D
keypoints. Using the estimates, a Perspective-n-Point (PnP) solver recovers
6-DoF poses from known 2D-3D correspondences. We train and evaluate our method
on the SPADES-RGB dataset and further assess its generalisation on real and
synthetic data from the SPARK-2024 dataset. Overall, our approach demonstrates
improved performance over single-image baselines in both 2D keypoint
localisation and 6-DoF pose estimation. Furthermore, it shows promising
generalisation capabilities when testing on different data distributions.

Abstract: As global interest in diverse culinary experiences grows, food image models
are essential for improving food-related applications by enabling accurate food
recognition, recipe suggestions, dietary tracking, and automated meal planning.
Despite the abundance of food datasets, a noticeable gap remains in capturing
the nuances of Indian cuisine due to its vast regional diversity, complex
preparations, and the lack of comprehensive labeled datasets that cover its
full breadth. Through this exploration, we uncover Khana, a new benchmark
dataset for food image classification, segmentation, and retrieval of dishes
from Indian cuisine. Khana fills the gap by establishing a taxonomy of Indian
cuisine and offering around 131K images in the dataset spread across 80 labels,
each with a resolution of 500x500 pixels. This paper describes the dataset
creation process and evaluates state-of-the-art models on classification,
segmentation, and retrieval as baselines. Khana bridges the gap between
research and development by providing a comprehensive and challenging benchmark

Motivation: 盲人和低视力用户拍摄的照片往往模糊或构图不佳，提出的视觉问题也经常模糊不清，导致多个有效答案，这与传统VQA系统假设单一答案和区域不匹配

Method: 使用LoRA调优的BLIP-2模型生成多样候选答案，用PolyFormer对每个答案进行空间定位，然后应用思维链推理模块评估答案是否指向相同或不同区域

Result: 在VQA-AnswerTherapy基准测试中，BLaVe-CoT优于先前方法，对辅助场景中常见的模糊性和视觉噪声更具鲁棒性

Conclusion: 这项工作强调了VQA系统需要适应真实人类不确定性，为盲人和低视力用户提供包容性支持

Abstract: Visual Question Answering (VQA) holds great potential for assisting Blind and
Low Vision (BLV) users, yet real-world usage remains challenging. Due to visual
impairments, BLV users often take blurry or poorly framed photos and face
difficulty in articulating specific questions about what they cannot fully see.
As a result, their visual questions are frequently ambiguous, and different
users may interpret them in diverse ways. This leads to multiple valid answers,
each grounded in different image regions-posing a mismatch with conventional
VQA systems that assume a single answer and region. To bridge this gap, we
present BLaVe-CoT, a VQA framework designed to reason about answer consistency
in the face of ambiguity. Our method proposes diverse candidate answers using a
LoRA-tuned BLIP-2 model, then grounds each answer spatially using PolyFormer,
and finally applies a chain-of-thought reasoning module to assess whether the
answers refer to the same or different regions. Evaluated on the
VQA-AnswerTherapy benchmark, BLaVe-CoT outperforms previous methods and proves
more robust to the ambiguity and visual noise common in assistive settings.
This work highlights the need for VQA systems that can adapt to real human
uncertainty and provide inclusive support for BLV users. To foster further
research and accessibility applications, we have made the code publicly
available at https://github.com/Accecwan/BLaVe-CoT.

Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Object Detection (OVD) has emerged as a pivotal technology
for applications involving Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). However, the
prevailing large-scale datasets for OVD pre-training are predominantly composed
of ground-level, natural images. This creates a significant domain gap, causing
models trained on them to exhibit a substantial drop in performance on UAV

engine. Then we construct and introduce UAVDE-2M(contains over 2,000,000
instances and 1800 categories) and UAVCAP-15k(contains over 15,000 images).
Furthermore, we propose a novel Cross-Attention Gated Enhancement Fusion (CAGE)

Conclusion: FDP框架通过排序机制有效编码微表情的动态信息，动态图像构建任务有助于捕捉面部细微动作并缓解数据稀缺问题，为微表情识别提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Facial micro-expression recognition (MER) is a challenging task, due to the
transience, subtlety, and dynamics of micro-expressions (MEs). Most existing
methods resort to hand-crafted features or deep networks, in which the former
often additionally requires key frames, and the latter suffers from small-scale
and low-diversity training data. In this paper, we develop a novel fine-grained
dynamic perception (FDP) framework for MER. We propose to rank frame-level
features of a sequence of raw frames in chronological order, in which the rank
process encodes the dynamic information of both ME appearances and motions.
Specifically, a novel local-global feature-aware transformer is proposed for
frame representation learning. A rank scorer is further adopted to calculate
rank scores of each frame-level feature. Afterwards, the rank features from
rank scorer are pooled in temporal dimension to capture dynamic representation.
Finally, the dynamic representation is shared by a MER module and a dynamic
image construction module, in which the former predicts the ME category, and
the latter uses an encoder-decoder structure to construct the dynamic image.
The design of dynamic image construction task is beneficial for capturing
facial subtle actions associated with MEs and alleviating the data scarcity
issue. Extensive experiments show that our method (i) significantly outperforms
the state-of-the-art MER methods, and (ii) works well for dynamic image
construction. Particularly, our FDP improves by 4.05%, 2.50%, 7.71%, and 2.11%
over the previous best results in terms of F1-score on the CASME II, SAMM,
CAS(ME)^2, and CAS(ME)^3 datasets, respectively. The code is available at

Abstract: Visual-LiDAR odometry is a critical component for autonomous system
localization, yet achieving high accuracy and strong robustness remains a
challenge. Traditional approaches commonly struggle with sensor misalignment,
fail to fully leverage temporal information, and require extensive manual
tuning to handle diverse sensor configurations. To address these problems, we
introduce DVLO4D, a novel visual-LiDAR odometry framework that leverages sparse
spatial-temporal fusion to enhance accuracy and robustness. Our approach
proposes three key innovations: (1) Sparse Query Fusion, which utilizes sparse
LiDAR queries for effective multi-modal data fusion; (2) a Temporal Interaction
and Update module that integrates temporally-predicted positions with current
frame data, providing better initialization values for pose estimation and
enhancing model's robustness against accumulative errors; and (3) a Temporal
Clip Training strategy combined with a Collective Average Loss mechanism that
aggregates losses across multiple frames, enabling global optimization and
reducing the scale drift over long sequences. Extensive experiments on the
KITTI and Argoverse Odometry dataset demonstrate the superiority of our
proposed DVLO4D, which achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of both
pose accuracy and robustness. Additionally, our method has high efficiency,
with an inference time of 82 ms, possessing the potential for the real-time

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决UAV传输线检修中小缺陷检测困难：传统检测器存在细节丢失、边界敏感性弱、全局与局部信息融合不充等问题

Method: 提出TinyDef-DETR框架，包括：无步长空间到深度重量化模块、边缘增强卷积、跨阶段双域多尺度注意力模块、Focaler-Wise-SIoU回归损失函数

Result: 在CSG-ADCD数据集上实验显示，检测精度和回归率显著提升，小物体子集上收益特别明显，计算开销仅中等；在VisDrone数据集上验证了泛化能力

Conclusion: 集成细节保留重量化、边缘敏感表征、双域注意力和难度自适应回归的方法，为基于UAV的电力网小缺陷检修提供了高效实用的解决方案

Abstract: Automated inspection of transmission lines using UAVs is hindered by the
difficulty of detecting small and ambiguous defects against complex
backgrounds. Conventional detectors often suffer from detail loss due to
strided downsampling, weak boundary sensitivity in lightweight backbones, and
insufficient integration of global context with local cues. To address these
challenges, we propose TinyDef-DETR, a DETR-based framework designed for
small-defect detection. The method introduces a stride-free space-to-depth
module for lossless downsampling, an edge-enhanced convolution for
boundary-aware feature extraction, a cross-stage dual-domain multi-scale
attention module to jointly capture global and local information, and a
Focaler-Wise-SIoU regression loss to improve localization of small objects.
Experiments conducted on the CSG-ADCD dataset demonstrate that TinyDef-DETR
achieves substantial improvements in both precision and recall compared to
competitive baselines, with particularly notable gains on small-object subsets,
while incurring only modest computational overhead. Further validation on the
VisDrone benchmark confirms the generalization capability of the proposed
approach. Overall, the results indicate that integrating detail-preserving
downsampling, edge-sensitive representations, dual-domain attention, and
difficulty-adaptive regression provides a practical and efficient solution for
UAV-based small-defect inspection in power grids.

Abstract: Recent advancements in aligning image and video generative models via GRPO
have achieved remarkable gains in enhancing human preference alignment.
However, these methods still face high computational costs from on-policy
rollouts and excessive SDE sampling steps, as well as training instability due
to sparse rewards. In this paper, we propose BranchGRPO, a novel method that
introduces a branch sampling policy updating the SDE sampling process. By
sharing computation across common prefixes and pruning low-reward paths and
redundant depths, BranchGRPO substantially lowers the per-update compute cost
while maintaining or improving exploration diversity. This work makes three
main contributions: (1) a branch sampling scheme that reduces rollout and
training cost; (2) a tree-based advantage estimator incorporating dense
process-level rewards; and (3) pruning strategies exploiting path and depth
redundancy to accelerate convergence and boost performance. Experiments on
image and video preference alignment show that BranchGRPO improves alignment
scores by 16% over strong baselines, while cutting training time by 50%.

TL;DR: 提出一种多阶段图神经网络架构，通过层次池化操作来收正传统GNN在高分辨率图结构中捕捉长距离依赖性的不足，并在自然对流热传递CFD模拟中展现优秀性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高保真CFD模拟需要专家物理模型、细缆格和大量计算，限制了迭代速度。虽然GNN能够从模拟数据中学习热流体行为，但传统GNN在高分辨率图结构中捕捉长距离依赖性时遇到困难。

Method: 设计了一种新的多阶段GNN架构，利用层次池化和反池化操作，在多个空间尺度上进行全局到局部的交互建模。在新开发的CFD数据集上进行评估，该数据集模拟了不同长宽比矩形封闭空间内的自然对流热传递。

Conclusion: 这些发现呈现了提出的多阶段GNN方法在网格基流体动力学模拟中建模复杂热传递过程的潜力。

Abstract: Buoyancy-driven heat transfer in closed cavities serves as a canonical
testbed for thermal design High-fidelity CFD modelling yields accurate thermal
field solutions, yet its reliance on expert-crafted physics models, fine
meshes, and intensive computation limits rapid iteration. Recent developments
in data-driven modeling, especially Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), offer new
alternatives for learning thermal-fluid behavior directly from simulation data,
particularly on irregular mesh structures. However, conventional GNNs often
struggle to capture long-range dependencies in high-resolution graph
structures. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel multi-stage GNN
architecture that leverages hierarchical pooling and unpooling operations to
progressively model global-to-local interactions across multiple spatial
scales. We evaluate the proposed model on our newly developed CFD dataset
simulating natural convection within a rectangular cavities with varying aspect
ratios where the bottom wall is isothermal hot, the top wall is isothermal
cold, and the two vertical walls are adiabatic. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed model achieves higher predictive accuracy,
improved training efficiency, and reduced long-term error accumulation compared
to state-of-the-art (SOTA) GNN baselines. These findings underscore the
potential of the proposed multi-stage GNN approach for modeling complex heat
transfer in mesh-based fluid dynamics simulations.

Conclusion: 该技术能够生产高质量的断层重建图像，为光学断层成像技术的发展提供了新的潜力

Abstract: In this work, we develop a novel technique for reconstructing images from
projection-based nano- and microtomography. Our contribution focuses on
enhancing reconstruction quality, particularly for specimen composed of
homogeneous material phases connected by sharp edges. This is accomplished by
training a neural network to identify edges within subpictures. The trained
network is then integrated into a mathematical optimization model, to reduce
artifacts from previous reconstructions. To this end, the optimization approach
favors solutions according to the learned predictions, however may also
determine alternative solutions if these are strongly supported by the raw
data. Hence, our technique successfully incorporates knowledge about the
homogeneity and presence of sharp edges in the sample and thereby eliminates
blurriness. Our results on experimental datasets show significant enhancements
in interface sharpness and material homogeneity compared to benchmark
algorithms. Thus, our technique produces high-quality reconstructions,
showcasing its potential for advancing tomographic imaging techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有微调策略存在局限：并行微调隔离任务无法利用共享知识，多任务微调需要同时访问所有数据集且难以增量集成任务

Method: 提出MedSeqFT框架，包含：(1)最大数据相似性选择，识别最能代表原始预训练分布的下游样本；(2)基于LoRA的知识蒸馏方案K&G RFT，平衡任务特定适应和预训练知识保留

Result: 在10个3D分割任务的两个多任务数据集上，MedSeqFT持续优于最先进微调策略，平均Dice提升3.0%。在未见任务（COVID-19-20和肾脏）上验证了迁移能力增强

Conclusion: 序列微调是适应基础模型到不断演进的临床任务的有效、知识保留范式

Abstract: Foundation models have become a promising paradigm for advancing medical
image analysis, particularly for segmentation tasks where downstream
applications often emerge sequentially. Existing fine-tuning strategies,
however, remain limited: parallel fine-tuning isolates tasks and fails to
exploit shared knowledge, while multi-task fine-tuning requires simultaneous
access to all datasets and struggles with incremental task integration. To
address these challenges, we propose MedSeqFT, a sequential fine-tuning
framework that progressively adapts pre-trained models to new tasks while
refining their representational capacity. MedSeqFT introduces two core
components: (1) Maximum Data Similarity (MDS) selection, which identifies
downstream samples most representative of the original pre-training
distribution to preserve general knowledge, and (2) Knowledge and
Generalization Retention Fine-Tuning (K&G RFT), a LoRA-based knowledge
distillation scheme that balances task-specific adaptation with the retention
of pre-trained knowledge. Extensive experiments on two multi-task datasets
covering ten 3D segmentation tasks demonstrate that MedSeqFT consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art fine-tuning strategies, yielding substantial
performance gains (e.g., an average Dice improvement of 3.0%). Furthermore,
evaluations on two unseen tasks (COVID-19-20 and Kidney) verify that MedSeqFT
enhances transferability, particularly for tumor segmentation. Visual analyses
of loss landscapes and parameter variations further highlight the robustness of
MedSeqFT. These results establish sequential fine-tuning as an effective,
knowledge-retentive paradigm for adapting foundation models to evolving
clinical tasks. Code will be released.

Result: 实验评估表明，该方法在PathoHR-Bench和六个额外病理数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法在细粒度病理表征方面表现出色，解决了现有VL模型在临床应用中建模复杂跨模态关系的局限性。

Abstract: Accurate analysis of pathological images is essential for automated tumor
diagnosis but remains challenging due to high structural similarity and subtle
morphological variations in tissue images. Current vision-language (VL) models
often struggle to capture the complex reasoning required for interpreting
structured pathological reports. To address these limitations, we propose
PathoHR-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate VL models' abilities in
hierarchical semantic understanding and compositional reasoning within the
pathology domain. Results of this benchmark reveal that existing VL models fail
to effectively model intricate cross-modal relationships, hence limiting their
applicability in clinical setting. To overcome this, we further introduce a
pathology-specific VL training scheme that generates enhanced and perturbed
samples for multimodal contrastive learning. Experimental evaluations
demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on
PathoHR-Bench and six additional pathology datasets, highlighting its
effectiveness in fine-grained pathology representation.

Motivation: 自动图像聚类在计算机视觉中很重要，但在图像增强应用中受限，主要原因是难以定义对该任务有意义的聚类。

Method: 提出CARDIE无监督算法，基于图像的颜色和亮度内容进行聚类；同时引入量化图像增强算法对亮度分布和局部方差影响的方法。

Result: CARDIE产生的聚类比基于语义图像属性的聚类更适合图像增强任务；利用CARDIE聚类重新采样图像增强数据集可以提升色调映射和去噪算法的性能。

Conclusion: CARDIE为图像增强任务提供了更有效的聚类方法，能够改善图像增强算法的性能，代码已公开以促进采用和确保可复现性。

Abstract: Automatic image clustering is a cornerstone of computer vision, yet its
application to image enhancement remains limited, primarily due to the
difficulty of defining clusters that are meaningful for this specific task. To
address this issue, we introduce CARDIE, an unsupervised algorithm that
clusters images based on their color and luminosity content. In addition, we
introduce a method to quantify the impact of image enhancement algorithms on
luminance distribution and local variance. Using this method, we demonstrate
that CARDIE produces clusters more relevant to image enhancement than those
derived from semantic image attributes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that CARDIE
clusters can be leveraged to resample image enhancement datasets, leading to
improved performance for tone mapping and denoising algorithms. To encourage
adoption and ensure reproducibility, we publicly release CARDIE code on our
GitHub.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多光谱和高光谱图像在农业、环境监测等领域有广泛应用，但存在空间分辨率与光谱分辨率的权衡问题。现有方法难以同时保持空间细节和光谱保真度

Method: 提出SpecSwin3D模型，采用3D移位窗口Transformer框架，输入5个多光谱波段，重构224个高光谱波段。引入级联训练策略和优化的波段序列设计

Result: PSNR达到35.82dB，SAM为2.40°，SSIM为0.96，比基线MHF-Net提升5.6dB PSNR，ERGAS降低一半以上。在下游任务中表现出实用价值

Conclusion: SpecSwin3D成功解决了多光谱到高光谱图像转换中的空间-光谱权衡问题，在重建质量和下游应用方面都表现出优异性能

Abstract: Multispectral and hyperspectral imagery are widely used in agriculture,
environmental monitoring, and urban planning due to their complementary spatial
and spectral characteristics. A fundamental trade-off persists: multispectral
imagery offers high spatial but limited spectral resolution, while
hyperspectral imagery provides rich spectra at lower spatial resolution. Prior
hyperspectral generation approaches (e.g., pan-sharpening variants, matrix
factorization, CNNs) often struggle to jointly preserve spatial detail and
spectral fidelity. In response, we propose SpecSwin3D, a transformer-based
model that generates hyperspectral imagery from multispectral inputs while
preserving both spatial and spectral quality. Specifically, SpecSwin3D takes
five multispectral bands as input and reconstructs 224 hyperspectral bands at
the same spatial resolution. In addition, we observe that reconstruction errors
grow for hyperspectral bands spectrally distant from the input bands. To
address this, we introduce a cascade training strategy that progressively
expands the spectral range to stabilize learning and improve fidelity.
Moreover, we design an optimized band sequence that strategically repeats and
orders the five selected multispectral bands to better capture pairwise
relations within a 3D shifted-window transformer framework. Quantitatively, our
model achieves a PSNR of 35.82 dB, SAM of 2.40{\deg}, and SSIM of 0.96,
outperforming the baseline MHF-Net by +5.6 dB in PSNR and reducing ERGAS by
more than half. Beyond reconstruction, we further demonstrate the practical
value of SpecSwin3D on two downstream tasks, including land use classification
and burnt area segmentation.

Motivation: AI从医学图像中提取生物标志物（如视网膜年龄）带来隐私风险，未经授权使用可能导致生物信息泄露。

Method: 采用特征级生成对抗掩蔽机制和多对一知识蒸馏策略，利用视网膜基础模型和多样化年龄编码器实现通用防御。

Result: RetinaGuard成功混淆视网膜年龄预测，对图像质量和病理特征表示影响最小。

Conclusion: 该框架可有效保护视网膜图像隐私，且可扩展到其他医学图像生物标志物的隐私保护。

Abstract: The integration of AI with medical images enables the extraction of implicit
image-derived biomarkers for a precise health assessment. Recently, retinal
age, a biomarker predicted from fundus images, is a proven predictor of
systemic disease risks, behavioral patterns, aging trajectory and even
mortality. However, the capability to infer such sensitive biometric data
raises significant privacy risks, where unauthorized use of fundus images could
lead to bioinformation leakage, breaching individual privacy. In response, we
formulate a new research problem of biometric privacy associated with medical
images and propose RetinaGuard, a novel privacy-enhancing framework that
employs a feature-level generative adversarial masking mechanism to obscure
retinal age while preserving image visual quality and disease diagnostic
utility. The framework further utilizes a novel multiple-to-one knowledge
distillation strategy incorporating a retinal foundation model and diverse
surrogate age encoders to enable a universal defense against black-box age
prediction models. Comprehensive evaluations confirm that RetinaGuard
successfully obfuscates retinal age prediction with minimal impact on image
quality and pathological feature representation. RetinaGuard is also flexible
for extension to other medical image derived biomarkers. RetinaGuard is also
flexible for extension to other medical image biomarkers.

Conclusion: UniVerse-1通过创新的专家拼接和在线标注技术，成功实现了音视频的协调生成，为多模态生成研究提供了新的解决方案和基准工具。

Abstract: We introduce UniVerse-1, a unified, Veo-3-like model capable of
simultaneously generating coordinated audio and video. To enhance training
efficiency, we bypass training from scratch and instead employ a stitching of
experts (SoE) technique. This approach deeply fuses the corresponding blocks of
pre-trained video and music generation experts models, thereby fully leveraging
their foundational capabilities. To ensure accurate annotations and temporal
alignment for both ambient sounds and speech with video content, we developed
an online annotation pipeline that processes the required training data and
generates labels during training process. This strategy circumvents the
performance degradation often caused by misalignment text-based annotations.
Through the synergy of these techniques, our model, after being finetuned on
approximately 7,600 hours of audio-video data, produces results with
well-coordinated audio-visuals for ambient sounds generation and strong
alignment for speech generation. To systematically evaluate our proposed
method, we introduce Verse-Bench, a new benchmark dataset. In an effort to
advance research in audio-video generation and to close the performance gap
with state-of-the-art models such as Veo3, we make our model and code publicly
available. We hope this contribution will benefit the broader research
community. Project page: https://dorniwang.github.io/UniVerse-1/.

Motivation: 现有的视频场景图生成方法通常针对特定粒度（边界框或像素级别），需要任务特定的架构和多阶段训练流程，缺乏统一的解决方案。

Method: 提出UNO框架：1）扩展槽注意机制将视觉特征分解为对象和关系槽；2）对象时序一致性学习确保跨帧表示一致性；3）动态三元组预测模块链接关系槽到对象对。

Result: 在标准边界框级别和像素级别VidSGG基准测试中达到有竞争力的性能，同时通过统一设计提高了效率。

Conclusion: UNO证明了统一框架在不同视觉粒度任务上的有效性，通过最大化参数共享和最小化任务特定修改实现了泛化能力。

Abstract: Video Scene Graph Generation (VidSGG) aims to represent dynamic visual
content by detecting objects and modeling their temporal interactions as
structured graphs. Prior studies typically target either coarse-grained
box-level or fine-grained panoptic pixel-level VidSGG, often requiring
task-specific architectures and multi-stage training pipelines. In this paper,
we present UNO (UNified Object-centric VidSGG), a single-stage, unified
framework that jointly addresses both tasks within an end-to-end architecture.
UNO is designed to minimize task-specific modifications and maximize parameter
sharing, enabling generalization across different levels of visual granularity.
The core of UNO is an extended slot attention mechanism that decomposes visual
features into object and relation slots. To ensure robust temporal modeling, we
introduce object temporal consistency learning, which enforces consistent
object representations across frames without relying on explicit tracking
modules. Additionally, a dynamic triplet prediction module links relation slots
to corresponding object pairs, capturing evolving interactions over time. We
evaluate UNO on standard box-level and pixel-level VidSGG benchmarks. Results
demonstrate that UNO not only achieves competitive performance across both
tasks but also offers improved efficiency through a unified, object-centric
design.

Abstract: Bone fractures present a major global health challenge, often resulting in
pain, reduced mobility, and productivity loss, particularly in low-resource
settings where access to expert radiology services is limited. Conventional
imaging methods suffer from high costs, radiation exposure, and dependency on
specialized interpretation. To address this, we developed an AI-based solution
for automated fracture detection from X-ray images using a custom Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) and benchmarked it against transfer learning models
including EfficientNetB0, MobileNetV2, and ResNet50. Training was conducted on
the publicly available FracAtlas dataset, comprising 4,083 anonymized
musculoskeletal radiographs. The custom CNN achieved 95.96% accuracy, 0.94
precision, 0.88 recall, and an F1-score of 0.91 on the FracAtlas dataset.
Although transfer learning models (EfficientNetB0, MobileNetV2, ResNet50)
performed poorly in this specific setup, these results should be interpreted in
light of class imbalance and data set limitations. This work highlights the
promise of lightweight CNNs for detecting fractures in X-rays and underscores
the importance of fair benchmarking, diverse datasets, and external validation
for clinical translation

Abstract: Object Recognition and Document Skew Estimation have come a long way in terms
of performance and efficiency. New models follow one of two directions:
improving performance using larger models, and improving efficiency using
smaller models. However, real-time document detection and rectification is a
niche that is largely unexplored by the literature, yet it remains a vital step
for automatic information retrieval from visual documents. In this work, we
strive towards an efficient document detection pipeline that is satisfactory in
terms of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) retrieval and faster than other
available solutions. We adapt IWPOD-Net, a license plate detection network, and
train it for detection on NBID, a synthetic ID card dataset. We experiment with
data augmentation and cross-dataset validation with MIDV (another synthetic ID
and passport document dataset) to find the optimal scenario for the model.
Other methods from both the Object Recognition and Skew Estimation
state-of-the-art are evaluated for comparison with our approach. We use each
method to detect and rectify the document, which is then read by an OCR system.
The OCR output is then evaluated using a novel OCR quality metric based on the
Levenshtein distance. Since the end goal is to improve automatic information
retrieval, we use the overall OCR quality as a performance metric. We observe
that with a promising model, document rectification does not have to be perfect
to attain state-of-the-art performance scores. We show that our model is
smaller and more efficient than current state-of-the-art solutions while
retaining a competitive OCR quality metric. All code is available at

### [96] [Spatial Reasoning with Vision-Language Models in Ego-Centric Multi-View Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06266)
*Mohsen Gholami,Ahmad Rezaei,Zhou Weimin,Yong Zhang,Mohammad Akbari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Ego3D-Bench基准测试和Ego3D-VLM框架，用于评估和提升视觉语言模型在自我中心多视角户外环境中的3D空间推理能力，结果显示当前模型与人类水平存在显著差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在3D空间关系理解方面存在重大局限，而现实世界中的具身AI智能体（如机器人和自动驾驶汽车）通常依赖自我中心的多视角观察，需要更好的空间推理能力。

Method: 创建了包含8,600多个问答对的Ego3D-Bench基准测试，并提出了Ego3D-VLM后训练框架，该框架基于估计的全局3D坐标生成认知地图来增强3D空间推理。

Result: 基准测试显示16个SOTA VLM与人类水平存在显著性能差距。Ego3D-VLM在多选题问答上平均提升12%，在绝对距离估计上平均提升56%。

Conclusion: Ego3D-Bench和Ego3D-VLM为在现实世界多视角环境中实现人类水平空间理解提供了有价值的工具，当前VLMs仍需改进以达到人类的空间理解水平。

Abstract: Understanding 3D spatial relationships remains a major limitation of current
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Prior work has addressed this issue by creating
spatial question-answering (QA) datasets based on single images or indoor
videos. However, real-world embodied AI agents such as robots and self-driving
cars typically rely on ego-centric, multi-view observations. To this end, we
introduce Ego3D-Bench, a new benchmark designed to evaluate the spatial
reasoning abilities of VLMs using ego-centric, multi-view outdoor data.
Ego3D-Bench comprises over 8,600 QA pairs, created with significant involvement
from human annotators to ensure quality and diversity. We benchmark 16 SOTA
VLMs, including GPT-4o, Gemini1.5-Pro, InternVL3, and Qwen2.5-VL. Our results
reveal a notable performance gap between human level scores and VLM
performance, highlighting that current VLMs still fall short of human level
spatial understanding. To bridge this gap, we propose Ego3D-VLM, a
post-training framework that enhances 3D spatial reasoning of VLMs. Ego3D-VLM
generates cognitive map based on estimated global 3D coordinates, resulting in
12% average improvement on multi-choice QA and 56% average improvement on
absolute distance estimation. Ego3D-VLM is modular and can be integrated with
any existing VLM. Together, Ego3D-Bench and Ego3D-VLM offer valuable tools for
advancing toward human level spatial understanding in real-world, multi-view
environments.

TL;DR: 提出基于自拍面部图像远程估计皮肤水合作用和经皮水分流失的系统解决方案，使用Skin-Prior Adaptive Vision Transformer模型，解决了数据标注不平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 皮肤屏障功能的定量指标（SH和TEWL）对公众监测皮肤状况很重要，但需要专业仪器测量，不便普及。希望通过智能手机自拍图像实现远程评估。

Method: 构建多阶段系统解决方案：包括数据收集、预处理，并提出新颖的Skin-Prior Adaptive Vision Transformer模型进行回归分析，使用对称对比正则化解决数据不平衡问题。

Result: 成功实现了从自拍面部图像估计SH和TEWL，通过对比正则化有效减少了模型偏差，是首个无需物理测量即可进行皮肤评估的研究。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了计算机视觉与皮肤护理研究之间的空白，为更广泛的实际应用提供了AI驱动的可访问皮肤分析方法。

Abstract: Skin health and disease resistance are closely linked to the skin barrier
function, which protects against environmental factors and water loss. Two key
physiological indicators can quantitatively represent this barrier function:
skin hydration (SH) and trans-epidermal water loss (TEWL). Measurement of SH
and TEWL is valuable for the public to monitor skin conditions regularly,
diagnose dermatological issues, and personalize their skincare regimens.
However, these measurements are not easily accessible to general users unless
they visit a dermatology clinic with specialized instruments. To tackle this
problem, we propose a systematic solution to estimate SH and TEWL from selfie
facial images remotely with smartphones. Our solution encompasses multiple
stages, including SH/TEWL data collection, data preprocessing, and formulating
a novel Skin-Prior Adaptive Vision Transformer model for SH/TEWL regression.
Through experiments, we identified the annotation imbalance of the SH/TEWL data
and proposed a symmetric-based contrastive regularization to reduce the model
bias due to the imbalance effectively. This work is the first study to explore
skin assessment from selfie facial images without physical measurements. It
bridges the gap between computer vision and skin care research, enabling
AI-driven accessible skin analysis for broader real-world applications.

*Jiangnan Xie,Xiaolong Zheng,Liang Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了PAML框架，通过原型感知多模态学习解决视觉定位在开放词汇场景中的三大挑战：模态对齐不足、跨模态特征融合不充分、语义原型信息利用不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于transformer的方法在标准场景中表现良好，但在开放词汇场景（包含新物体类别）中存在明显局限，主要由于视觉-语言模态对齐不完美、跨模态特征融合不足、语义原型信息利用效率低。

Method: 使用ALBEF进行初始跨模态特征对齐，视觉判别特征编码器增强显著物体表示，原型发现与继承机制提取聚合多邻域语义原型，多阶段解码器进行综合多模态整合和边界框回归。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上的实验表明，在标准场景中具有竞争力，在开放词汇场景中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: PAML框架通过系统性解决三大关键问题，显著提升了开放词汇场景下的视觉定位性能，为处理新物体类别提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Visual Grounding (VG) aims to utilize given natural language queries to
locate specific target objects within images. While current transformer-based
approaches demonstrate strong localization performance in standard scene (i.e,
scenarios without any novel objects), they exhibit notable limitations in
open-vocabulary scene (i.e, both familiar and novel object categories during
testing). These limitations primarily stem from three key factors: (1)
imperfect alignment between visual and linguistic modalities, (2) insufficient
cross-modal feature fusion, and (3) ineffective utilization of semantic
prototype information. To overcome these challenges, we present Prototype-Aware
Multimodal Learning (PAML), an innovative framework that systematically
addresses these issues through several key components: First, we leverage ALBEF
to establish robust cross-modal alignment during initial feature encoding.
Subsequently, our Visual Discriminative Feature Encoder selectively enhances
salient object representations while suppressing irrelevant visual context. The
framework then incorporates a novel prototype discovering and inheriting
mechanism that extracts and aggregates multi-neighbor semantic prototypes to
facilitate open-vocabulary recognition. These enriched features undergo
comprehensive multimodal integration through our Multi-stage Decoder before
final bounding box regression. Extensive experiments across five benchmark
datasets validate our approach, showing competitive performance in standard
scene while achieving state-of-the-art results in open-vocabulary scene. Our
code is available at https://github.com/plankXie/PAML.

*Zhang Jing,Pu Nan,Xie Yu Xiang,Guo Yanming,Lu Qianqi,Zou Shiwei,Yan Jie,Chen Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该文章将广义类别发现(GCD)扩展到视频领域，提出了视频-GCD新设置和基于内存导向一致性对比学习(MCCL)的方法，通过时间-空间线索提升新类别发现的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GCD方法主要基于静态图像，但单纯视觉内容不能可靠地发现新类别。需要将问题扩展到视频领域，利用时间维度信息来提升发现性能。

Method: 提出MCCL框架，包含两个核心组件：一致性感知对比学习(CACL)和内存导向表征增强(MGRE)。CACL利用多视角时间特征估计一致性分数来权重对比损失，MGRE通过双层内存缓冲提供全局上下文来增强表征学习。

Result: 在行为识别和鸟类分类视频数据集上进行了涉广实验，结果显示该方法显著超过了来自图像基础设置的竞争方法，证明了时间信息对视频中新类别发现的重要性。

Conclusion: 该研究成功将GCD扩展到视频领域，提出的MCCL框架通过有效整合时间-空间线索和形成表征学习与一致性建模的互相增强循环，显著提升了视频中新类别发现的性能。

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) is an emerging and challenging
open-world problem that has garnered increasing attention in recent years. Most
existing GCD methods focus on discovering categories in static images. However,
relying solely on static visual content is often insufficient to reliably
discover novel categories. To bridge this gap, we extend the GCD problem to the
video domain and introduce a new setting, termed Video-GCD. Thus, effectively
integrating multi-perspective information across time is crucial for accurate
Video-GCD. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel Memory-guided
Consistency-aware Contrastive Learning (MCCL) framework, which explicitly
captures temporal-spatial cues and incorporates them into contrastive learning
through a consistency-guided voting mechanism. MCCL consists of two core
components: Consistency-Aware Contrastive Learning(CACL) and Memory-Guided
Representation Enhancement (MGRE). CACL exploits multiperspective temporal
features to estimate consistency scores between unlabeled instances, which are
then used to weight the contrastive loss accordingly. MGRE introduces a
dual-level memory buffer that maintains both feature-level and logit-level
representations, providing global context to enhance intra-class compactness
and inter-class separability. This in turn refines the consistency estimation
in CACL, forming a mutually reinforcing feedback loop between representation
learning and consistency modeling. To facilitate a comprehensive evaluation, we
construct a new and challenging Video-GCD benchmark, which includes action
recognition and bird classification video datasets. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms competitive GCD
approaches adapted from image-based settings, highlighting the importance of
temporal information for discovering novel categories in videos. The code will
be publicly available.

TL;DR: 提出Text4Seg++框架，通过文本作为掩码的新范式，将图像分割转化为文本生成问题，无需额外解码器，在多种视觉任务中实现强大分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视觉语言任务中表现出色，但如何有效整合图像分割仍是一个重大挑战。需要简化分割过程并提高效率。

Method: 引入语义描述符作为分割掩码的文本表示，包括图像级和框级语义描述符。使用行级游程编码(R-RLE)压缩冗余文本，将分割转化为下一个砖块预测任务。

Result: 在自然和遥感数据集上的综合实验显示，Text4Seg++在各种基准测试中始终优于最先进模型，无需任务特定微调，推理速度提升3倍。

Conclusion: 该工作证明了在MLLM框架内文本驱动图像分割的有效性、可扩展性和泛化能力，为简化分割流程提供了新思路。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown exceptional capabilities
in vision-language tasks. However, effectively integrating image segmentation
into these models remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose a
novel text-as-mask paradigm that casts image segmentation as a text generation
problem, eliminating the need for additional decoders and significantly
simplifying the segmentation process. Our key innovation is semantic
descriptors, a new textual representation of segmentation masks where each
image patch is mapped to its corresponding text label. We first introduce
image-wise semantic descriptors, a patch-aligned textual representation of
segmentation masks that integrates naturally into the language modeling
pipeline. To enhance efficiency, we introduce the Row-wise Run-Length Encoding
(R-RLE), which compresses redundant text sequences, reducing the length of
semantic descriptors by 74% and accelerating inference by $3\times$, without
compromising performance. Building upon this, our initial framework Text4Seg
achieves strong segmentation performance across a wide range of vision tasks.
To further improve granularity and compactness, we propose box-wise semantic
descriptors, which localizes regions of interest using bounding boxes and
represents region masks via structured mask tokens called semantic bricks. This
leads to our refined model, Text4Seg++, which formulates segmentation as a
next-brick prediction task, combining precision, scalability, and generative
efficiency. Comprehensive experiments on natural and remote sensing datasets
show that Text4Seg++ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models across
diverse benchmarks without any task-specific fine-tuning, while remaining
compatible with existing MLLM backbones. Our work highlights the effectiveness,
scalability, and generalizability of text-driven image segmentation within the
MLLM framework.

Abstract: The precise characterization of plant morphology provides valuable insights
into plant environment interactions and genetic evolution. A key technology for
extracting this information is 3D segmentation, which delineates individual
plant organs from complex point clouds. Despite significant progress in general
3D computer vision domains, the adoption of 3D segmentation for plant
phenotyping remains limited by three major challenges: i) the scarcity of
large-scale annotated datasets, ii) technical difficulties in adapting advanced
deep neural networks to plant point clouds, and iii) the lack of standardized
benchmarks and evaluation protocols tailored to plant science. This review
systematically addresses these barriers by: i) providing an overview of
existing 3D plant datasets in the context of general 3D segmentation domains,
ii) systematically summarizing deep learning-based methods for point cloud
semantic and instance segmentation, iii) introducing Plant Segmentation Studio
(PSS), an open-source framework for reproducible benchmarking, and iv)
conducting extensive quantitative experiments to evaluate representative
networks and sim-to-real learning strategies. Our findings highlight the
efficacy of sparse convolutional backbones and transformer-based instance
segmentation, while also emphasizing the complementary role of modeling-based
and augmentation-based synthetic data generation for sim-to-real learning in
reducing annotation demands. In general, this study bridges the gap between
algorithmic advances and practical deployment, providing immediate tools for
researchers and a roadmap for developing data-efficient and generalizable deep
learning solutions in 3D plant phenotyping. Data and code are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有货币识别系统往往忽视可用性和真伪评估，特别是在低资源环境中，视觉障碍用户和离线验证需求普遍，现有方法主要关注面额分类而忽略了物理损坏和伪造问题

Method: 使用轻量级CNN模型进行面额分类，通过新颖的统一货币损坏指数(UCDI)进行损坏量化，采用基于特征的模板匹配进行假币检测，数据集包含82,000多张标注图像

Result: Custom_CNN模型实现了高分类性能和低参数数量，UCDI指标提供了基于二进制掩码损失、色度失真和结构特征损失的连续可用性评分，假币检测模块在不同成像条件下都能可靠识别伪造纸币

Conclusion: 该框架支持实时设备端推理，解决了受限环境中的关键部署挑战，证明了准确、可解释且紧凑的解决方案能够在实际场景中支持包容性货币评估

Abstract: Currency recognition systems often overlook usability and authenticity
assessment, especially in low-resource environments where visually impaired
users and offline validation are common. While existing methods focus on
denomination classification, they typically ignore physical degradation and
forgery, limiting their applicability in real-world conditions. This paper
presents a unified framework for currency evaluation that integrates three
modules: denomination classification using lightweight CNN models, damage
quantification through a novel Unified Currency Damage Index (UCDI), and
counterfeit detection using feature-based template matching. The dataset
consists of over 82,000 annotated images spanning clean, damaged, and
counterfeit notes. Our Custom_CNN model achieves high classification
performance with low parameter count. The UCDI metric provides a continuous
usability score based on binary mask loss, chromatic distortion, and structural
feature loss. The counterfeit detection module demonstrates reliable
identification of forged notes across varied imaging conditions. The framework
supports real-time, on-device inference and addresses key deployment challenges
in constrained environments. Results show that accurate, interpretable, and
compact solutions can support inclusive currency evaluation in practical
settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间敏感视频理解任务可以从帧中的目标对象信息中受益，但直接将目标注释转换为文本描述会引入额外标记长度和对目标级别信息噪声的敏感性。

Method: 提出GO-Tokenizer轻量级附加模块，利用现成的目标检测器实时编码紧凑的目标信息，避免使用文本描述。

Result: 实验结果表明，使用GO-Tokenizer预训练的模型在推理时间定位和密集字幕等任务上优于原始视频大语言模型及其使用文本描述目标的对应版本，且增益在不同模型、数据集和任务上具有通用性。

Conclusion: GO-Tokenizer通过有效编码目标信息显著提升了视频大语言模型的时间敏感视频理解能力，为解决文本描述带来的问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We propose to improve the time-sensitive video understanding (TSV) capability
of video large language models (Video-LLMs) with grounded objects (GO). We
hypothesize that TSV tasks can benefit from GO within frames, which is
supported by our preliminary experiments on LITA, a state-of-the-art Video-LLM
for reasoning temporal localization. While augmenting prompts with textual
description of these object annotations improves the performance of LITA, it
also introduces extra token length and susceptibility to the noise in object
level information. To address this, we propose GO-Tokenizer, a lightweight
add-on module for Video-LLMs leveraging off-the-shelf object detectors to
encode compact object information on the fly. Experimental results demonstrate
that pretraining with GO-Tokenizer outperforms the vanilla Video-LLM and its
counterpart utilizing textual description of objects in the prompt. The gain
generalizes across different models, datasets and video understanding tasks
such as reasoning temporal localization and dense captioning.

Motivation: 现有的基于CLIP的面部防欺骗方法未能充分利用CLIP的补丁嵌入令牌，且依赖单一文本提示，限制了泛化能力

Method: 提出MVP-FAS框架，包含多视角注意力模块(MVS)和多文本补丁对齐模块(MTPA)，利用多文本生成泛化特征并减少对领域特定文本的依赖

Result: 在跨域数据集上超越了之前的最先进方法，表现出优异的泛化性能

Conclusion: MVP-FAS通过充分利用CLIP的补丁嵌入和多文本表示，有效解决了面部防欺骗中的泛化问题

Abstract: Recent face anti-spoofing (FAS) methods have shown remarkable cross-domain
performance by employing vision-language models like CLIP. However, existing
CLIP-based FAS models do not fully exploit CLIP's patch embedding tokens,
failing to detect critical spoofing clues. Moreover, these models rely on a
single text prompt per class (e.g., 'live' or 'fake'), which limits
generalization. To address these issues, we propose MVP-FAS, a novel framework
incorporating two key modules: Multi-View Slot attention (MVS) and Multi-Text
Patch Alignment (MTPA). Both modules utilize multiple paraphrased texts to
generate generalized features and reduce dependence on domain-specific text.
MVS extracts local detailed spatial features and global context from patch
embeddings by leveraging diverse texts with multiple perspectives. MTPA aligns
patches with multiple text representations to improve semantic robustness.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MVP-FAS achieves superior generalization
performance, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods on cross-domain
datasets. Code: https://github.com/Elune001/MVP-FAS.

Abstract: Colorectal diseases, including inflammatory conditions and neoplasms, require
quick, accurate care to be effectively treated. Traditional diagnostic
pipelines require extensive preparation and rely on separate, individual
evaluations on histological images and colonoscopy footage, introducing
possible variability and inefficiencies. This pilot study proposes a unified
deep learning network that uses convolutional neural networks (CN N s) to
classify both histopathological slides and colonoscopy video frames in one
pipeline. The pipeline integrates class-balancing learning, robust
augmentation, and calibration methods to ensure accurate results. Static colon
histology images were taken from the PathMNIST dataset, and the lower
gastrointestinal (colonoscopy) videos were drawn from the HyperKvasir dataset.
The CNN architecture used was ResNet-50. This study demonstrates an
interpretable and reproducible diagnostic pipeline that unifies multiple
diagnostic modalities to advance and ease the detection of colorectal diseases.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Drought stress is a major threat to global crop productivity, making its
early and precise detection essential for sustainable agricultural management.
Traditional approaches, though useful, are often time-consuming and
labor-intensive, which has motivated the adoption of deep learning methods. In
recent years, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision Transformer
architectures have been widely explored for drought stress identification;
however, these models generally rely on a large number of trainable parameters,
restricting their use in resource-limited and real-time agricultural settings.
To address this challenge, we propose a novel lightweight hybrid CNN framework
inspired by ResNet, DenseNet, and MobileNet architectures. The framework
achieves a remarkable 15-fold reduction in trainable parameters compared to
conventional CNN and Vision Transformer models, while maintaining competitive
accuracy. In addition, we introduce a machine unlearning mechanism based on a
gradient norm-based influence function, which enables targeted removal of
specific training data influence, thereby improving model adaptability. The
method was evaluated on an aerial image dataset of potato fields with
expert-annotated healthy and drought-stressed regions. Experimental results
show that our framework achieves high accuracy while substantially lowering
computational costs. These findings highlight its potential as a practical,
scalable, and adaptive solution for drought stress monitoring in precision
agriculture, particularly under resource-constrained conditions.

Abstract: Despite remarkable progress in Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR),
traditional models often struggle to generalize across varying scale factors,
limiting their real-world applicability. To address this, we propose a plug-in
Scale-Aware Attention Module (SAAM) designed to retrofit modern fixed-scale SR
models with the ability to perform arbitrary-scale SR. SAAM employs
lightweight, scale-adaptive feature extraction and upsampling, incorporating
the Simple parameter-free Attention Module (SimAM) for efficient guidance and
gradient variance loss to enhance sharpness in image details. Our method
integrates seamlessly into multiple state-of-the-art SR backbones (e.g., SCNet,
HiT-SR, OverNet), delivering competitive or superior performance across a wide
range of integer and non-integer scale factors. Extensive experiments on
benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach enables robust multi-scale
upscaling with minimal computational overhead, offering a practical solution

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑转移瘤是癌症患者死亡的主要原因之一，但纵向MRI图像分析工作量极大，临床医生无法完整标注和量化分析，影响了疗效评估和个性化治疗的优化。

Method: 建立自动化数据汇总流水线，收集了177名患者的896个脑转移瘤的长期跟踪数据（>360天，每2个月一次）。采用数据驱动聚类方法识别成长轨迹，并使用梯度提升和图机器学习方法进行12个月疗效预测。

Result: 聚类分析发现5种主要成长轨迹，分别对应不同的最终疗效类别。疗效预测表现优异：梯度提升方法仅使用治疗前和第一次跟踪MRI即可达到0.90 AUC（CI95%=0.88-0.92）；图机器学习方法达到0.88 AUC（CI95%=0.86-0.90），且能够处理多个输入时间点配置。

Conclusion: 该研究为脑转移瘤SRS治疗的全面评估和预测提供了自动化和高精度的解决方案，为可扩展的数据汇总和脑转移瘤成长模式研究奠定了基础，有助于发展临床决策支持系统优化个性化治疗。

Abstract: Brain Metastases (BM) are a large contributor to mortality of patients with
cancer. They are treated with Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS) and monitored
with Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) at regular follow-up intervals according
to treatment guidelines. Analyzing and quantifying this longitudinal imaging
represents an intractable workload for clinicians. As a result, follow-up
images are not annotated and merely assessed by observation. Response to
treatment in longitudinal imaging is being studied, to better understand growth
trajectories and ultimately predict treatment success or toxicity as early as
possible. In this study, we implement an automated pipeline to curate a large
longitudinal dataset of SRS treatment data, resulting in a cohort of 896 BMs in
177 patients who were monitored for >360 days at approximately two-month
intervals at Lausanne University Hospital (CHUV). We use a data-driven
clustering to identify characteristic trajectories. In addition, we predict 12
months lesion-level response using classical as well as graph machine learning
Graph Machine Learning (GML). Clustering revealed 5 dominant growth
trajectories with distinct final response categories. Response prediction
reaches up to 0.90 AUC (CI95%=0.88-0.92) using only pre-treatment and first
follow-up MRI with gradient boosting. Similarly, robust predictive performance
of up to 0.88 AUC (CI95%=0.86-0.90) was obtained using GML, offering more
flexibility with a single model for multiple input time-points configurations.
Our results suggest potential automation and increased precision for the
comprehensive assessment and prediction of BM response to SRS in longitudinal
MRI. The proposed pipeline facilitates scalable data curation for the
investigation of BM growth patterns, and lays the foundation for clinical
decision support systems aiming at optimizing personalized care.

*Matthieu Gendrin,Stéphane Pateux,Théo Ladune*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文针对3D高斯泼溅在大型场景中的位置量化问题，提出了一种基于球坐标的新型量化方案，解决了远距离投影误差放大的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS在大型场景中，输入视图来自有限空间区域，重建主要适用于相同区域的新视角(3DoF+)。传统量化方法在远距离投影时会产生显著的像素误差，因为投影误差与投影点距离的平方倒数成正比。

Method: 提出基于球坐标的量化方案，通过分析位置误差对投影误差的影响，设计了更适合远距离投影的量化策略，在Garden场景上进行了验证。

Result: 新量化方法在率失真性能方面表现优异，有效降低了远距离投影时的像素误差，提升了3DGS在大型场景中的重建质量。

Conclusion: 球坐标量化方案能够更好地处理3DGS在大型场景中的位置量化问题，为6DoF视图生成中的位置精度控制提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a major breakthrough in 3D scene
reconstruction. With a number of views of a given object or scene, the
algorithm trains a model composed of 3D gaussians, which enables the production
of novel views from arbitrary points of view. This freedom of movement is
referred to as 6DoF for 6 degrees of freedom: a view is produced for any
position (3 degrees), orientation of camera (3 other degrees). On large scenes,
though, the input views are acquired from a limited zone in space, and the
reconstruction is valuable for novel views from the same zone, even if the
scene itself is almost unlimited in size. We refer to this particular case as
3DoF+, meaning that the 3 degrees of freedom of camera position are limited to
small offsets around the central position. Considering the problem of
coordinate quantization, the impact of position error on the projection error
in pixels is studied. It is shown that the projection error is proportional to
the squared inverse distance of the point being projected. Consequently, a new
quantization scheme based on spherical coordinates is proposed. Rate-distortion
performance of the proposed method are illustrated on the well-known Garden
scene.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉-语言模型在文档理解任务中表现突出，但高计算需求成为挑战，需要寻找降低计算成本的方法。

Method: 使用二进制补丁级分类器去除非文本区域，通过最大池化精炼步骤恢复碎片化的文本区域以提升空间一致性。

Abstract: Recent progress in vision-language models (VLMs) has led to impressive
results in document understanding tasks, but their high computational demands
remain a challenge. To mitigate the compute burdens, we propose a lightweight
token pruning framework that filters out non-informative background regions
from document images prior to VLM processing. A binary patch-level classifier
removes non-text areas, and a max-pooling refinement step recovers fragmented
text regions to enhance spatial coherence. Experiments on real-world document
datasets demonstrate that our approach substantially lowers computational
costs, while maintaining comparable accuracy.

TL;DR: Phantom-Insight是一种基于SAM和MLLM的视频伪装目标检测新方法，通过动态前景视觉令牌评分和提示网络增强对象边缘细节分离能力，采用解耦的前景-背景学习策略提升目标与背景的可分离性，在MoCA-Mask数据集上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有VCOD方法的两个主要问题：SAM方法因模型冻结而难以分离伪装目标边缘，MLLM方法因大语言模型合并前景和背景而导致目标可分离性差。

Method: 1) 使用时序和空间线索表示视频序列，通过LLM进行特征融合增加信息密度；2) 通过动态前景视觉令牌评分模块和提示网络生成多线索，自适应引导和微调SAM模型；3) 提出解耦的前景-背景学习策略，分别生成前景和背景线索进行解耦训练。

Result: 在MoCA-Mask数据集上实现了最先进的性能，在CAD2016数据集上展示了检测未见伪装目标的强大泛化能力。

Conclusion: Phantom-Insight通过结合SAM和MLLM的优势，有效解决了视频伪装目标检测中的边缘分离和目标-背景分离问题，具有优异的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Video camouflaged object detection (VCOD) is challenging due to dynamic
environments. Existing methods face two main issues: (1) SAM-based methods
struggle to separate camouflaged object edges due to model freezing, and (2)
MLLM-based methods suffer from poor object separability as large language
models merge foreground and background. To address these issues, we propose a
novel VCOD method based on SAM and MLLM, called Phantom-Insight. To enhance the
separability of object edge details, we represent video sequences with temporal
and spatial clues and perform feature fusion via LLM to increase information
density. Next, multiple cues are generated through the dynamic foreground
visual token scoring module and the prompt network to adaptively guide and
fine-tune the SAM model, enabling it to adapt to subtle textures. To enhance
the separability of objects and background, we propose a decoupled
foreground-background learning strategy. By generating foreground and
background cues separately and performing decoupled training, the visual token
can effectively integrate foreground and background information independently,
enabling SAM to more accurately segment camouflaged objects in the video.
Experiments on the MoCA-Mask dataset show that Phantom-Insight achieves
state-of-the-art performance across various metrics. Additionally, its ability
to detect unseen camouflaged objects on the CAD2016 dataset highlights its
strong generalization ability.

Abstract: Muzzle patterns are among the most effective biometric traits for cattle
identification. Fast and accurate detection of the muzzle region as the region
of interest is critical to automatic visual cattle identification.. Earlier
approaches relied on manual detection, which is labor-intensive and
inconsistent. Recently, automated methods using supervised models like YOLO
have become popular for muzzle detection. Although effective, these methods
require extensive annotated datasets and tend to be trained data-dependent,
limiting their performance on new or unseen cattle. To address these
limitations, this study proposes a zero-shot muzzle detection framework based
on Grounding DINO, a vision-language model capable of detecting muzzles without
any task-specific training or annotated data. This approach leverages natural
language prompts to guide detection, enabling scalable and flexible muzzle
localization across diverse breeds and environments. Our model achieves a mean
Average Precision (mAP)@0.5 of 76.8\%, demonstrating promising performance
without requiring annotated data. To our knowledge, this is the first research
to provide a real-world, industry-oriented, and annotation-free solution for
cattle muzzle detection. The framework offers a practical alternative to
supervised methods, promising improved adaptability and ease of deployment in
livestock monitoring applications.

Result: 大量实验证明PBAN在超分辨率图像质量评估方面优于最先进的方法

Conclusion: PBAN通过双向注意力机制和感知导向设计，有效提升了超分辨率图像质量评估的性能

Abstract: Many super-resolution (SR) algorithms have been proposed to increase image
resolution. However, full-reference (FR) image quality assessment (IQA) metrics
for comparing and evaluating different SR algorithms are limited. In this work,
we propose the Perception-oriented Bidirectional Attention Network (PBAN) for
image SR FR-IQA, which is composed of three modules: an image encoder module, a
perception-oriented bidirectional attention (PBA) module, and a quality
prediction module. First, we encode the input images for feature
representations. Inspired by the characteristics of the human visual system, we
then construct the perception-oriented PBA module. Specifically, different from
existing attention-based SR IQA methods, we conceive a Bidirectional Attention
to bidirectionally construct visual attention to distortion, which is
consistent with the generation and evaluation processes of SR images. To
further guide the quality assessment towards the perception of distorted
information, we propose Grouped Multi-scale Deformable Convolution, enabling
the proposed method to adaptively perceive distortion. Moreover, we design
Sub-information Excitation Convolution to direct visual perception to both
sub-pixel and sub-channel attention. Finally, the quality prediction module is
exploited to integrate quality-aware features and regress quality scores.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed PBAN outperforms
state-of-the-art quality assessment methods.

Abstract: Cross-source point cloud registration, which aims to align point cloud data
from different sensors, is a fundamental task in 3D vision. However, compared
to the same-source point cloud registration, cross-source registration faces
two core challenges: the lack of publicly available large-scale real-world
datasets for training the deep registration models, and the inherent
differences in point clouds captured by multiple sensors. The diverse patterns
induced by the sensors pose great challenges in robust and accurate point cloud
feature extraction and matching, which negatively influence the registration
accuracy. To advance research in this field, we construct Cross3DReg, the
currently largest and real-world multi-modal cross-source point cloud
registration dataset, which is collected by a rotating mechanical lidar and a
hybrid semi-solid-state lidar, respectively. Moreover, we design an
overlap-based cross-source registration framework, which utilizes unaligned
images to predict the overlapping region between source and target point
clouds, effectively filtering out redundant points in the irrelevant regions
and significantly mitigating the interference caused by noise in
non-overlapping areas. Then, a visual-geometric attention guided matching
module is proposed to enhance the consistency of cross-source point cloud
features by fusing image and geometric information to establish reliable
correspondences and ultimately achieve accurate and robust registration.
Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art
registration performance. Our framework reduces the relative rotation error
(RRE) and relative translation error (RTE) by $63.2\%$ and $40.2\%$,
respectively, and improves the registration recall (RR) by $5.4\%$, which
validates its effectiveness in achieving accurate cross-source registration.

Abstract: Deep neural networks currently dominate many fields of the artificial
intelligence landscape, achieving state-of-the-art results on numerous tasks
while remaining hard to understand and exhibiting surprising weaknesses. An
active area of research focuses on adversarial attacks, which aim to generate
inputs that uncover these weaknesses. However, this proves challenging,
especially in the black-box scenario where model details are inaccessible. This
paper explores in detail the impact of such adversarial algorithms on
ResNet-18, DenseNet-121, Swin Transformer V2, and Vision Transformer network
architectures. Leveraging the Tiny ImageNet, Caltech-256, and Food-101
datasets, we benchmark two novel black-box iterative adversarial algorithms
based on affine transformations and genetic algorithms: 1) Affine
Transformation Attack (ATA), an iterative algorithm maximizing our attack score
function using random affine transformations, and 2) Affine Genetic Attack
(AGA), a genetic algorithm that involves random noise and affine
transformations. We evaluate the performance of the models in the algorithm
parameter variation, data augmentation, and global and targeted attack
configurations. We also compare our algorithms with two black-box adversarial
algorithms, Pixle and Square Attack. Our experiments yield better results on
the image classification task than similar methods in the literature, achieving
an accuracy improvement of up to 8.82%. We provide noteworthy insights into
successful adversarial defenses and attacks at both global and targeted levels,
and demonstrate adversarial robustness through algorithm parameter variation.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了视觉复杂度与注意力机制的相互作用，为通过对比注意力改进视觉推理提供了高效途径

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success across
diverse visual tasks, yet their performance degrades in complex visual
environments. While existing enhancement approaches require additional
training, rely on external segmentation tools, or operate at coarse-grained
levels, they overlook the innate ability within VLMs. To bridge this gap, we
investigate VLMs' attention patterns and discover that: (1) visual complexity
strongly correlates with attention entropy, negatively impacting reasoning
performance; (2) attention progressively refines from global scanning in
shallow layers to focused convergence in deeper layers, with convergence degree
determined by visual complexity. (3) Theoretically, we prove that the contrast
of attention maps between general queries and task-specific queries enables the
decomposition of visual signal into semantic signals and visual noise
components. Building on these insights, we propose Contrastive Attention
Refinement for Visual Enhancement (CARVE), a training-free method that extracts
task-relevant visual signals through attention contrasting at the pixel level.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that CARVE consistently enhances performance,
achieving up to 75% improvement on open-source models. Our work provides
critical insights into the interplay between visual complexity and attention
mechanisms, offering an efficient pathway for improving visual reasoning with
contrasting attention.

Abstract: Realistic and parameterized 3D models of human anatomy have become invaluable
in research, diagnostics, and surgical planning. However, the development of
detailed models for internal organs, such as the stomach, has been limited by
data availability and methodological challenges. In this paper, we propose a
novel pipeline for the generation of synthetic 3D stomach models, enabling the
creation of anatomically diverse morphologies informed by established studies
on stomach shape variability. Using this pipeline, we construct a dataset of
synthetic stomachs. Building on this dataset, we develop a 3D statistical shape
model of the stomach, trained to capture natural anatomical variability in a
low-dimensional shape space. The model is further refined using CT meshes
derived from publicly available datasets through a semi-supervised alignment
process, enhancing its ability to generalize to unseen anatomical variations.
We evaluated the model on a held-out test set of real stomach CT scans,
demonstrating robust generalization and fit accuracy. We make the statistical
shape model along with the synthetic dataset publicly available on GitLab:
https://gitlab.com/Erez.Posner/stomach_pytorch to facilitate further research.
This work introduces the first statistical 3D shape model of the stomach, with
applications ranging from surgical simulation and pre-operative planning to
medical education and computational modeling. By combining synthetic data

represents a significant advancement in organ modeling and opens new
possibilities for personalized healthcare solutions.

Abstract: The advent of large-scale vision foundation models, pre-trained on diverse
natural images, has marked a paradigm shift in computer vision. However, how
the frontier vision foundation models' efficacies transfer to specialized
domains remains such as medical imaging remains an open question. This report
investigates whether DINOv3, a state-of-the-art self-supervised vision
transformer (ViT) that features strong capability in dense prediction tasks,
can directly serve as a powerful, unified encoder for medical vision tasks
without domain-specific pre-training. To answer this, we benchmark DINOv3
across common medical vision tasks, including 2D/3D classification and
segmentation on a wide range of medical imaging modalities. We systematically
analyze its scalability by varying model sizes and input image resolutions. Our
findings reveal that DINOv3 shows impressive performance and establishes a
formidable new baseline. Remarkably, it can even outperform medical-specific
foundation models like BiomedCLIP and CT-Net on several tasks, despite being
trained solely on natural images. However, we identify clear limitations: The
model's features degrade in scenarios requiring deep domain specialization,
such as in Whole-Slide Pathological Images (WSIs), Electron Microscopy (EM),
and Positron Emission Tomography (PET). Furthermore, we observe that DINOv3
does not consistently obey scaling law in the medical domain; performance does
not reliably increase with larger models or finer feature resolutions, showing
diverse scaling behaviors across tasks. Ultimately, our work establishes DINOv3
as a strong baseline, whose powerful visual features can serve as a robust
prior for multiple complex medical tasks. This opens promising future
directions, such as leveraging its features to enforce multiview consistency in
3D reconstruction.

Conclusion: FSG-Net通过频域和空间域的协同处理，有效解决了变化检测中的伪变化问题和特征融合难题，为高分辨率遥感图像变化检测提供了新的有效解决方案

Abstract: Change detection from high-resolution remote sensing images lies as a
cornerstone of Earth observation applications, yet its efficacy is often
compromised by two critical challenges. First, false alarms are prevalent as
models misinterpret radiometric variations from temporal shifts (e.g.,
illumination, season) as genuine changes. Second, a non-negligible semantic gap
between deep abstract features and shallow detail-rich features tends to
obstruct their effective fusion, culminating in poorly delineated boundaries.
To step further in addressing these issues, we propose the Frequency-Spatial
Synergistic Gated Network (FSG-Net), a novel paradigm that aims to
systematically disentangle semantic changes from nuisance variations.
Specifically, FSG-Net first operates in the frequency domain, where a
Discrepancy-Aware Wavelet Interaction Module (DAWIM) adaptively mitigates
pseudo-changes by discerningly processing different frequency components.
Subsequently, the refined features are enhanced in the spatial domain by a
Synergistic Temporal-Spatial Attention Module (STSAM), which amplifies the
saliency of genuine change regions. To finally bridge the semantic gap, a
Lightweight Gated Fusion Unit (LGFU) leverages high-level semantics to
selectively gate and integrate crucial details from shallow layers.
Comprehensive experiments on the CDD, GZ-CD, and LEVIR-CD benchmarks validate
the superiority of FSG-Net, establishing a new state-of-the-art with F1-scores
of 94.16%, 89.51%, and 91.27%, respectively. The code will be made available at

Abstract: In industrial quality control, to visually recognize unwanted items within a
moving heterogeneous stream, human operators are often still indispensable.
Waste-sorting stands as a significant example, where operators on multiple
conveyor belts manually remove unwanted objects to select specific materials.
To automate this recognition problem, computer vision systems offer great
potential in accurately identifying and segmenting unwanted items in such
settings. Unfortunately, considering the multitude and the variety of sorting
tasks, fully supervised approaches are not a viable option to address this
challange, as they require extensive labeling efforts. Surprisingly, weakly
supervised alternatives that leverage the implicit supervision naturally
provided by the operator in his removal action are relatively unexplored. In
this paper, we define the concept of Before-After Supervision, illustrating how
to train a segmentation network by leveraging only the visual differences
between images acquired \textit{before} and \textit{after} the operator. To
promote research in this direction, we introduce WS$^2$ (Weakly Supervised
segmentation for Waste-Sorting), the first multiview dataset consisting of more
than 11 000 high-resolution video frames captured on top of a conveyor belt,
including "before" and "after" images. We also present a robust end-to-end
pipeline, used to benchmark several state-of-the-art weakly supervised
segmentation methods on WS$^2$.

TL;DR: TIDE框架通过目标监督和偏好学习解决主题驱动图像生成中身份保持与指令遵循的平衡问题，无需测试时微调即可实现优异性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在主题驱动图像生成中无法充分解决保持主题身份与遵循动态编辑指令之间的张力问题

Method: 提出目标监督三元组对齐方法，使用(参考图像,指令,目标图像)三元组建模主题适应动态，通过DSD目标训练模型学习平衡的保持-遵循目标

Result: 在标准基准测试中表现出色，在保持主题忠实性和指令遵循性方面优于基线方法，多个量化指标领先

Conclusion: TIDE框架成功解决了主题驱动图像生成的核心挑战，具有广泛的应用潜力，包括结构条件生成、图像到图像生成和文本图像插值等任务

Abstract: Subject-driven image generation (SDIG) aims to manipulate specific subjects
within images while adhering to textual instructions, a task crucial for
advancing text-to-image diffusion models. SDIG requires reconciling the tension
between maintaining subject identity and complying with dynamic edit
instructions, a challenge inadequately addressed by existing methods. In this
paper, we introduce the Target-Instructed Diffusion Enhancing (TIDE) framework,
which resolves this tension through target supervision and preference learning
without test-time fine-tuning. TIDE pioneers target-supervised triplet
alignment, modelling subject adaptation dynamics using a (reference image,
instruction, target images) triplet. This approach leverages the Direct Subject
Diffusion (DSD) objective, training the model with paired "winning" (balanced
preservation-compliance) and "losing" (distorted) targets, systematically
generated and evaluated via quantitative metrics. This enables implicit reward
modelling for optimal preservation-compliance balance. Experimental results on
standard benchmarks demonstrate TIDE's superior performance in generating
subject-faithful outputs while maintaining instruction compliance,
outperforming baseline methods across multiple quantitative metrics. TIDE's
versatility is further evidenced by its successful application to diverse
tasks, including structural-conditioned generation, image-to-image generation,
and text-image interpolation. Our code is available at

Conclusion: 学习图像表征与领域特定政学特征的协同结合为神经隔离体学自动治疗响应评估提供了稳健有效的解决方案

Abstract: Accurate evaluation of the response of glioblastoma to therapy is crucial for
clinical decision-making and patient management. The Response Assessment in
Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria provide a standardized framework to assess
patients' clinical response, but their application can be complex and subject
to observer variability. This paper presents an automated method for
classifying the intervention response from longitudinal MRI scans, developed to
predict tumor response during therapy as part of the BraTS 2025 challenge. We
propose a novel hybrid framework that combines deep learning derived feature
extraction and an extensive set of radiomics and clinically chosen features.
Our approach utilizes a fine-tuned ResNet-18 model to extract features from 2D
regions of interest across four MRI modalities. These deep features are then
fused with a rich set of more than 4800 radiomic and clinically driven
features, including 3D radiomics of tumor growth and shrinkage masks,
volumetric changes relative to the nadir, and tumor centroid shift. Using the
fused feature set, a CatBoost classifier achieves a mean ROC AUC of 0.81 and a
Macro F1 score of 0.50 in the 4-class response prediction task (Complete
Response, Partial Response, Stable Disease, Progressive Disease). Our results
highlight that synergizing learned image representations with domain-targeted
radiomic features provides a robust and effective solution for automated
treatment response assessment in neuro-oncology.

Motivation: 验证Luo等人(2024)提出的FairCLIP方法的可复现性，并研究如何通过最小化Sinkhorn距离来减少CLIP模型在敏感组别间的图像-文本相似性差异

Method: 重现原实验设置，发现实现与描述不一致后开发了A-FairCLIP对比研究，提出FairCLIP+扩展多属性目标，分析距离最小化对公平性和性能的影响

Result: 证实CLIP在医疗扫描零样本青光眼分类中存在人口统计学偏见，但FairCLIP的正式实现和A-FairCLIP均未能改善性能或公平性，虽然Sinkhorn距离减少但无法推翻原研究结论

Conclusion: 该研究无法重现FairCLIP的结果，距离最小化并不能有效提升CLIP模型的公平性能力，对原研究方法的可靠性提出了质疑

Abstract: We investigated the reproducibility of FairCLIP, proposed by Luo et al.
(2024), for improving the group fairness of CLIP (Radford et al., 2021) by
minimizing image-text similarity score disparities across sensitive groups
using the Sinkhorn distance. The experimental setup of Luo et al. (2024) was
reproduced to primarily investigate the research findings for FairCLIP. The
model description by Luo et al. (2024) was found to differ from the original
implementation. Therefore, a new implementation, A-FairCLIP, is introduced to
examine specific design choices. Furthermore, FairCLIP+ is proposed to extend
the FairCLIP objective to include multiple attributes. Additionally, the impact
of the distance minimization on FairCLIP's fairness and performance was
explored. In alignment with the original authors, CLIP was found to be biased
towards certain demographics when applied to zero-shot glaucoma classification
using medical scans and clinical notes from the Harvard-FairVLMed dataset.
However, the experimental results on two datasets do not support their claim
that FairCLIP improves the performance and fairness of CLIP. Although the
regularization objective reduces Sinkhorn distances, both the official
implementation and the aligned implementation, A-FairCLIP, were not found to
improve performance nor fairness in zero-shot glaucoma classification.

Conclusion: FMOX格式提供了一种可访问和可重用的方式来处理FMO数据集，为机器学习管道提供了便利，代码和JSON文件已开源共享。

Abstract: Fast and tiny object tracking remains a challenge in computer vision and in
this paper we first introduce a JSON metadata file associated with four open
source datasets of Fast Moving Objects (FMOs) image sequences. In addition, we
extend the description of the FMOs datasets with additional ground truth
information in JSON format (called FMOX) with object size information. Finally
we use our FMOX file to test a recently proposed foundational model for
tracking (called EfficientTAM) showing that its performance compares well with
the pipelines originally taylored for these FMO datasets. Our comparison of
these state-of-the-art techniques on FMOX is provided with Trajectory
Intersection of Union (TIoU) scores. The code and JSON is shared open source
allowing FMOX to be accessible and usable for other machine learning pipelines
aiming to process FMO datasets.

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注检索模型的架构改进，而忽略了真实世界草图中固有的模糊性和噪声问题。本文强调需要设计对草图变异性具有鲁棒性的训练目标。

Method: 采用适当的预训练策略、编码器架构和损失函数设计组合，专门针对草图变异性进行鲁棒性训练，不引入额外模型复杂度。

Result: 在具有挑战性的FS-COCO和广泛使用的SketchyCOCO数据集上进行了大量实验，证明了方法的有效性，达到了最先进的性能水平。

Conclusion: 训练设计在跨模态检索任务中起着关键作用，同时需要改进场景级草图图像检索的评估场景，本文方法为处理草图模糊性提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The goal of Scene-level Sketch-Based Image Retrieval is to retrieve natural
images matching the overall semantics and spatial layout of a free-hand sketch.
Unlike prior work focused on architectural augmentations of retrieval models,
we emphasize the inherent ambiguity and noise present in real-world sketches.
This insight motivates a training objective that is explicitly designed to be
robust to sketch variability. We show that with an appropriate combination of
pre-training, encoder architecture, and loss formulation, it is possible to
achieve state-of-the-art performance without the introduction of additional
complexity. Extensive experiments on a challenging FS-COCO and widely-used
SketchyCOCO datasets confirm the effectiveness of our approach and underline
the critical role of training design in cross-modal retrieval tasks, as well as
the need to improve the evaluation scenarios of scene-level SBIR.

Motivation: 现有开放集识别方法主要针对静态场景，无法有效处理连续数据流中不断出现的新未知类别，导致决策边界判别性下降和类间混淆

Method: RARL方法：1)在等角紧框架构建的角度空间中，将未知表示对齐到非活跃原型周围；2)采用虚拟-内在交互训练策略，通过边界邻近虚拟类压缩已知表示；3)设计分层校正策略精化决策边界

Result: 在CIFAR100和TinyImageNet数据集上建立IOSR新基准，在各种任务设置下均达到state-of-the-art性能

Conclusion: RARL方法有效解决了增量开放集识别中的表示漂移和决策边界退化问题，为动态环境下的开放集识别提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Existing open set recognition (OSR) methods are typically designed for static
scenarios, where models aim to classify known classes and identify unknown ones
within fixed scopes. This deviates from the expectation that the model should
incrementally identify newly emerging unknown classes from continuous data
streams and acquire corresponding knowledge. In such evolving scenarios, the
discriminability of OSR decision boundaries is hard to maintain due to
restricted access to former training data, causing severe inter-class
confusion. To solve this problem, we propose retentive angular representation
learning (RARL) for incremental open set recognition (IOSR). In RARL, unknown
representations are encouraged to align around inactive prototypes within an
angular space constructed under the equiangular tight frame, thereby mitigating
excessive representation drift during knowledge updates. Specifically, we adopt
a virtual-intrinsic interactive (VII) training strategy, which compacts known
representations by enforcing clear inter-class margins through
boundary-proximal virtual classes. Furthermore, a stratified rectification
strategy is designed to refine decision boundaries, mitigating representation
bias and feature space distortion caused by imbalances between old/new and
positive/negative class samples. We conduct thorough evaluations on CIFAR100
and TinyImageNet datasets and establish a new benchmark for IOSR. Experimental
results across various task setups demonstrate that the proposed method
achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Motivation: 数学形态学在向量值图像（如彩色和高光谱图像）处理中缺乏统一的向量排序方法，需要找到最合适的排序方式来构建形态学算子。

Method: 采用机器学习方法学习近似Condorcet排序的简化排序，Condorcet排序基于投票问题思想，通过多个不同排序的投票结果来排名元素。

Result: 初步计算实验证实了学习简化映射在定义彩色图像向量值形态学算子方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法为解决向量值图像数学形态学中的排序共识问题提供了一种有效的机器学习解决方案。

Abstract: Mathematical morphology provides a nonlinear framework for image and spatial
data processing and analysis. Although there have been many successful
applications of mathematical morphology to vector-valued images, such as color
and hyperspectral images, there is still no consensus on the most suitable
vector ordering for constructing morphological operators. This paper addresses
this issue by examining a reduced ordering approximating the Condorcet ranking
derived from a set of vector orderings. Inspired by voting problems, the
Condorcet ordering ranks elements from most to least voted, with voters
representing different orderings. In this paper, we develop a machine learning
approach that learns a reduced ordering that approximates the Condorcet
ordering. Preliminary computational experiments confirm the effectiveness of
learning the reduced mapping to define vector-valued morphological operators
for color images.

Motivation: 现有多视图扩散模型采用非自回归形式，限制了在世界建模中的应用，只支持固定视图数且由于同时去噪所有帧导致推理速度慢。

Method: 使用因果掩码和逐帧噪声训练，采用成对相对相机位姿编码(CaPE)实现精确相机控制。推理时结合空间感知滑动窗口、键值缓存和噪声条件增强来减轻漂移。

Result: 实验表明CausNVS支持广泛的相机轨迹，实现灵活的自回归新视图合成，在不同设置下保持一致的强视觉质量。

Conclusion: CausNVS通过自回归方法成功解决了多视图扩散模型在视图配置灵活性和推理效率方面的限制，为3D新视图合成提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-view diffusion models have shown promise in 3D novel view synthesis,
but most existing methods adopt a non-autoregressive formulation. This limits
their applicability in world modeling, as they only support a fixed number of
views and suffer from slow inference due to denoising all frames
simultaneously. To address these limitations, we propose CausNVS, a multi-view
diffusion model in an autoregressive setting, which supports arbitrary
input-output view configurations and generates views sequentially. We train
CausNVS with causal masking and per-frame noise, using pairwise-relative camera
pose encodings (CaPE) for precise camera control. At inference time, we combine
a spatially-aware sliding-window with key-value caching and noise conditioning
augmentation to mitigate drift. Our experiments demonstrate that CausNVS
supports a broad range of camera trajectories, enables flexible autoregressive
novel view synthesis, and achieves consistently strong visual quality across
diverse settings. Project page: https://kxhit.github.io/CausNVS.html.

Abstract: Unsustainable trade in wildlife is a major threat to biodiversity and is now
increasingly prevalent in digital marketplaces and social media. With the sheer
volume of digital content, the need for automated methods to detect wildlife
trade listings is growing. These methods are especially needed for the
automatic identification of wildlife products, such as ivory. We developed
machine learning-based object recognition models that can identify wildlife
products within images and highlight them. The data consists of images of
elephant, pangolin, and tiger products that were identified as being sold
illegally or that were confiscated by authorities. Specifically, the wildlife
products included elephant ivory and skins, pangolin scales, and claws (raw and
crafted), and tiger skins and bones. We investigated various combinations of
training strategies and two loss functions to identify the best model to use in
the automatic detection of these wildlife products. Models were trained for
each species while also developing a single model to identify products from all
three species. The best model showed an overall accuracy of 84.2% with
accuracies of 71.1%, 90.2% and 93.5% in detecting products derived from
elephants, pangolins, and tigers, respectively. We further demonstrate that the
machine learning model can be made easily available to stakeholders, such as
government authorities and law enforcement agencies, by developing a
smartphone-based application that had an overall accuracy of 91.3%. The
application can be used in real time to click images and help identify
potentially prohibited products of target species. Thus, the proposed method is
not only applicable for monitoring trade on the web but can also be used e.g.
in physical markets for monitoring wildlife trade.

Motivation: 低剂量CT和PET虽然减少了辐射暴露，但会导致噪声和伪影增加，影响诊断准确性，因此需要有效的去噪方法来提升图像质量。

Method: 提出HSANet网络，包含高效全局注意力(EGA)模块增强空间和通道交互，以及混合上采样模块防止过拟合噪声。

Result: 在公开LDCT/PET数据集上验证，HSANet相比现有方法获得更优的去噪性能，且模型轻量适合标准GPU部署。

Conclusion: 该方法具有高度实用性，适合真实临床环境应用。

Abstract: Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) and positron emission tomography (PET)
have emerged as safer alternatives to conventional imaging modalities by
significantly reducing radiation exposure. However, this reduction often
results in increased noise and artifacts, which can compromise diagnostic
accuracy. Consequently, denoising for LDCT/PET has become a vital area of
research aimed at enhancing image quality while maintaining radiation safety.
In this study, we introduce a novel Hybrid Swin Attention Network (HSANet),
which incorporates Efficient Global Attention (EGA) modules and a hybrid
upsampling module. The EGA modules enhance both spatial and channel-wise
interaction, improving the network's capacity to capture relevant features,
while the hybrid upsampling module mitigates the risk of overfitting to noise.
We validate the proposed approach using a publicly available LDCT/PET dataset.
Experimental results demonstrate that HSANet achieves superior denoising
performance compared to existing methods, while maintaining a lightweight model
size suitable for deployment on GPUs with standard memory configurations. This
makes our approach highly practical for real-world clinical applications.

Result: CNN-LSTM模型达到98%的高准确率，显著超过仅使用空间特征的CNN模型(80.45%)和其他机器学习方法(76%)

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效捕捉氮素缺乏、水分强迫和杂草压力之间的复杂交互作用，为及时预防性识别氮素强迫提供了强大工具，有助于改善作物管理和植物健康

Abstract: Plants in their natural habitats endure an array of interacting stresses,
both biotic and abiotic, that rarely occur in isolation. Nutrient
stress-particularly nitrogen deficiency-becomes even more critical when
compounded with drought and weed competition, making it increasingly difficult
to distinguish and address its effects. Early detection of nitrogen stress is
therefore crucial for protecting plant health and implementing effective
management strategies. This study proposes a novel deep learning framework to
accurately classify nitrogen stress severity in a combined stress environment.
Our model uses a unique blend of four imaging modalities-RGB, multispectral,
and two infrared wavelengths-to capture a wide range of physiological plant
responses from canopy images. These images, provided as time-series data,
document plant health across three levels of nitrogen availability (low,
medium, and high) under varying water stress and weed pressures. The core of
our approach is a spatio-temporal deep learning pipeline that merges a
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for extracting spatial features from images
with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to capture temporal dependencies.
We also devised and evaluated a spatial-only CNN pipeline for comparison. Our
CNN-LSTM pipeline achieved an impressive accuracy of 98%, impressively
surpassing the spatial-only model's 80.45% and other previously reported
machine learning method's 76%. These results bring actionable insights based on
the power of our CNN-LSTM approach in effectively capturing the subtle and
complex interactions between nitrogen deficiency, water stress, and weed
pressure. This robust platform offers a promising tool for the timely and
proactive identification of nitrogen stress severity, enabling better crop
management and improved plant health.

Conclusion: VIM-GS通过结合稀疏和密集深度信息，成功解决了大场景单目图像新视角合成的深度估计难题，实现了高质量的高斯溅射渲染。

Abstract: VIM-GS is a Gaussian Splatting (GS) framework using monocular images for
novel-view synthesis (NVS) in large scenes. GS typically requires accurate
depth to initiate Gaussian ellipsoids using RGB-D/stereo cameras. Their limited
depth sensing range makes it difficult for GS to work in large scenes.
Monocular images, however, lack depth to guide the learning and lead to
inferior NVS results. Although large foundation models (LFMs) for monocular
depth estimation are available, they suffer from cross-frame inconsistency,
inaccuracy for distant scenes, and ambiguity in deceptive texture cues. This
paper aims to generate dense, accurate depth images from monocular RGB inputs
for high-definite GS rendering. The key idea is to leverage the accurate but
sparse depth from visual-inertial Structure-from-Motion (SfM) to refine the
dense but coarse depth from LFMs. To bridge the sparse input and dense output,
we propose an object-segmented depth propagation algorithm that renders the
depth of pixels of structured objects. Then we develop a dynamic depth
refinement module to handle the crippled SfM depth of dynamic objects and
refine the coarse LFM depth. Experiments using public and customized datasets
demonstrate the superior rendering quality of VIM-GS in large scenes.

Conclusion: BioLite U-Net在分割准确性、效率和部署性方面都显示出优势，适合集成到智能闭环生物打印系统中实现实时监控和质量控制。

Abstract: Bioprinting is a rapidly advancing field that offers a transformative
approach to fabricating tissue and organ models through the precise deposition
of cell-laden bioinks. Ensuring the fidelity and consistency of printed
structures in real-time remains a core challenge, particularly under
constraints imposed by limited imaging data and resource-constrained embedded
hardware. Semantic segmentation of the extrusion process, differentiating
between nozzle, extruded bioink, and surrounding background, enables in situ
monitoring critical to maintaining print quality and biological viability. In
this work, we introduce a lightweight semantic segmentation framework tailored
for real-time bioprinting applications. We present a novel, manually annotated
dataset comprising 787 RGB images captured during the bioprinting process,
labeled across three classes: nozzle, bioink, and background. To achieve fast
and efficient inference suitable for integration with bioprinting systems, we
propose a BioLite U-Net architecture that leverages depthwise separable
convolutions to drastically reduce computational load without compromising
accuracy. Our model is benchmarked against MobileNetV2 and MobileNetV3-based
segmentation baselines using mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), Dice score,
and pixel accuracy. All models were evaluated on a Raspberry Pi 4B to assess
real-world feasibility. The proposed BioLite U-Net achieves an mIoU of 92.85%
and a Dice score of 96.17%, while being over 1300x smaller than
MobileNetV2-DeepLabV3+. On-device inference takes 335 ms per frame,
demonstrating near real-time capability. Compared to MobileNet baselines,
BioLite U-Net offers a superior tradeoff between segmentation accuracy,
efficiency, and deployability, making it highly suitable for intelligent,
closed-loop bioprinting systems.

Result: 在MVTec和BTAD数据集上的大量实验表明，STAGE在工业异常合成方面达到了最先进的性能，并有效提升了下游异常分割任务的表现。

Abstract: Segmentation-oriented Industrial Anomaly Synthesis (SIAS) plays a pivotal
role in enhancing the performance of downstream anomaly segmentation, as it
provides an effective means of expanding abnormal data. However, existing SIAS
methods face several critical limitations: (i) the synthesized anomalies often
lack intricate texture details and fail to align precisely with the surrounding
background, and (ii) they struggle to generate fine-grained, pixel-level
anomalies. To address these challenges, we propose Segmentation-oriented
Anomaly synthesis via Graded diffusion with Explicit mask alignment, termed
STAGE. STAGE introduces a novel anomaly inference strategy that incorporates
clean background information as a prior to guide the denoising distribution,
enabling the model to more effectively distinguish and highlight abnormal
foregrounds. Furthermore, it employs a graded diffusion framework with an
anomaly-only branch to explicitly record local anomalies during both the
forward and reverse processes, ensuring that subtle anomalies are not
overlooked. Finally, STAGE incorporates the explicit mask alignment (EMA)
strategy to progressively align the synthesized anomalies with the background,
resulting in context-consistent and structurally coherent generations.
Extensive experiments on the MVTec and BTAD datasets demonstrate that STAGE
achieves state-of-the-art performance in SIAS, which in turn enhances
downstream anomaly segmentation.

Abstract: Brain tumors are serious health problems that require early diagnosis due to
their high mortality rates. Diagnosing tumors by examining Magnetic Resonance
Imaging (MRI) images is a process that requires expertise and is prone to
error. Therefore, the need for automated diagnosis systems is increasing day by
day. In this context, a robust and explainable Deep Learning (DL) model for the
classification of brain tumors is proposed. In this study, a publicly available
Figshare dataset containing 3,064 T1-weighted contrast-enhanced brain MRI
images of three tumor types was used. First, the classification performance of
nine well-known CNN architectures was evaluated to determine the most effective
backbone. Among these, EfficientNetV2 demonstrated the best performance and was
selected as the backbone for further development. Subsequently, an
attention-based MLP-Mixer architecture was integrated into EfficientNetV2 to
enhance its classification capability. The performance of the final model was
comprehensively compared with basic CNNs and the methods in the literature.
Additionally, Grad-CAM visualization was used to interpret and validate the
decision-making process of the proposed model. The proposed model's performance
was evaluated using the five-fold cross-validation method. The proposed model
demonstrated superior performance with 99.50% accuracy, 99.47% precision,
99.52% recall and 99.49% F1 score. The results obtained show that the model
outperforms the studies in the literature. Moreover, Grad-CAM visualizations
demonstrate that the model effectively focuses on relevant regions of MRI
images, thus improving interpretability and clinical reliability. A robust deep
learning model for clinical decision support systems has been obtained by
combining EfficientNetV2 and attention-based MLP-Mixer, providing high accuracy
and interpretability in brain tumor classification.

Conclusion: Zo3T框架通过创新的测试时训练机制，成功解决了轨迹引导图像到视频生成中的3D真实性和运动准确性问题，为无需大量标注数据的视频生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Trajectory-Guided image-to-video (I2V) generation aims to synthesize videos
that adhere to user-specified motion instructions. Existing methods typically
rely on computationally expensive fine-tuning on scarce annotated datasets.
Although some zero-shot methods attempt to trajectory control in the latent
space, they may yield unrealistic motion by neglecting 3D perspective and
creating a misalignment between the manipulated latents and the network's noise
predictions. To address these challenges, we introduce Zo3T, a novel zero-shot
test-time-training framework for trajectory-guided generation with three core
innovations: First, we incorporate a 3D-Aware Kinematic Projection, leveraging
inferring scene depth to derive perspective-correct affine transformations for
target regions. Second, we introduce Trajectory-Guided Test-Time LoRA, a
mechanism that dynamically injects and optimizes ephemeral LoRA adapters into
the denoising network alongside the latent state. Driven by a regional feature
consistency loss, this co-adaptation effectively enforces motion constraints
while allowing the pre-trained model to locally adapt its internal
representations to the manipulated latent, thereby ensuring generative fidelity
and on-manifold adherence. Finally, we develop Guidance Field Rectification,
which refines the denoising evolutionary path by optimizing the conditional
guidance field through a one-step lookahead strategy, ensuring efficient
generative progression towards the target trajectory. Zo3T significantly
enhances 3D realism and motion accuracy in trajectory-controlled I2V
generation, demonstrating superior performance over existing training-based and
zero-shot approaches.

Conclusion: 通过协同组织分割和细胞核分割任务，Co-Seg框架能够更好地理解组织病理学图像，为肿瘤微环境和细胞形态分析提供更准确的分割结果。

Abstract: Histopathology image analysis is critical yet challenged by the demand of
segmenting tissue regions and nuclei instances for tumor microenvironment and
cellular morphology analysis. Existing studies focused on tissue semantic
segmentation or nuclei instance segmentation separately, but ignored the
inherent relationship between these two tasks, resulting in insufficient
histopathology understanding. To address this issue, we propose a Co-Seg
framework for collaborative tissue and nuclei segmentation. Specifically, we
introduce a novel co-segmentation paradigm, allowing tissue and nuclei
segmentation tasks to mutually enhance each other. To this end, we first devise
a region-aware prompt encoder (RP-Encoder) to provide high-quality semantic and
instance region prompts as prior constraints. Moreover, we design a mutual
prompt mask decoder (MP-Decoder) that leverages cross-guidance to strengthen
the contextual consistency of both tasks, collaboratively computing semantic
and instance segmentation masks. Extensive experiments on the PUMA dataset
demonstrate that the proposed Co-Seg surpasses state-of-the-arts in the
semantic, instance and panoptic segmentation of tumor tissues and nuclei
instances. The source code is available at https://github.com/xq141839/Co-Seg.

Abstract: With the rapid development of computer vision and machine learning, automated
methods for pothole detection and recognition based on image and video data
have received significant attention. It is of great significance for social
development to conduct an in-depth analysis of road images through feature
extraction, thereby achieving automatic identification of the pothole condition
in new images. Consequently, this is the main issue addressed in this study.
Based on preprocessing techniques such as standardization, normalization, and
data augmentation applied to the collected raw dataset, we continuously
improved the network model based on experimental results. Ultimately, we
constructed a deep learning feature extraction network
ResNet50-EfficientNet-RegNet model based on transfer learning. This model
exhibits high classification accuracy and computational efficiency. In terms of
model evaluation, this study employed a comparative evaluation approach by
comparing the performance of the proposed transfer learning model with other
models, including Random Forest, MLP, SVM, and LightGBM. The comparison
analysis was conducted based on metrics such as Accuracy, Recall, Precision,
F1-score, and FPS, to assess the classification performance of the transfer
learning model proposed in this paper. The results demonstrate that our model
exhibits high performance in terms of recognition speed and accuracy,
surpassing the performance of other models. Through careful parameter selection
and model optimization, our transfer learning model achieved a classification
accuracy of 97.78% (88/90) on the initial set of 90 test samples and 98.89%

TL;DR: Raw2Event是一个硬件-软件系统，能够从低成本原始帧相机实时生成事件流，提供比RGB帧到事件转换器更高的动态范围、分辨率和更真实的输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件相机虽然具有高时间分辨率、低延迟和高动态范围等优势，但高成本、有限分辨率以及缺乏自动对焦等功能限制了其广泛应用，特别是在早期开发和原型设计阶段。

Method: 通过直接访问原始Bayer数据并绕过传统图像信号处理器(ISP)，基于DVS-Voltmeter模型构建可配置的仿真框架，并设计支持原始数据、RGB和事件流同步记录的数据采集管道。

Conclusion: 该系统在树莓派上实现实时操作，为基于事件的视觉研究和早期系统开发提供了可扩展且经济高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Event cameras offer unique advantages such as high temporal resolution, low
latency, and high dynamic range, making them more and more popular for vision
tasks under challenging light conditions. However, their high cost, limited
resolution, and lack of features such as autofocus hinder their broad adoption,
particularly for early-stage development and prototyping. In this work, we
present Raw2Event, a complete hardware-software system that enables real-time
event generation from low-cost raw frame-based cameras. By leveraging direct
access to raw Bayer data and bypassing traditional image signal processors
(ISP), our system is able to utilize the full potential of camera hardware,
delivering higher dynamic range, higher resolution, and more faithful output
than RGB-based frame-to-event converters.
  Built upon the DVS-Voltmeter model, Raw2Event features a configurable
simulation framework optimized for deployment on embedded platforms. We further
design a data acquisition pipeline that supports synchronized recording of raw,
RGB, and event streams, facilitating downstream evaluation and dataset
creation. Experimental results show that Raw2Event can generate event streams
closely resembling those from real event cameras, while benefiting from higher
resolution and autofocus capabilities. The system also supports user-intuitive
parameter tuning, enabling flexible adaptation to various application
requirements. Finally, we deploy the system on a Raspberry Pi for real-time
operation, providing a scalable and cost-effective solution for event-based
vision research and early-stage system development.

Abstract: Dark humor in online memes poses unique challenges due to its reliance on
implicit, sensitive, and culturally contextual cues. To address the lack of
resources and methods for detecting dark humor in multimodal content, we
introduce a novel dataset of 4,379 Reddit memes annotated for dark humor,
target category (gender, mental health, violence, race, disability, and other),
and a three-level intensity rating (mild, moderate, severe). Building on this
resource, we propose a reasoning-augmented framework that first generates
structured explanations for each meme using a Large Vision-Language Model
(VLM). Through a Role-Reversal Self-Loop, VLM adopts the author's perspective
to iteratively refine its explanations, ensuring completeness and alignment. We
then extract textual features from both the OCR transcript and the self-refined
reasoning via a text encoder, while visual features are obtained using a vision
transformer. A Tri-stream Cross-Reasoning Network (TCRNet) fuses these three
streams, text, image, and reasoning, via pairwise attention mechanisms,
producing a unified representation for classification. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach outperforms strong baselines across three tasks:
dark humor detection, target identification, and intensity prediction. The
dataset, annotations, and code are released to facilitate further research in
multimodal humor understanding and content moderation. Code and Dataset are

Abstract: This article presents UrbanTwin datasets - high-fidelity, realistic replicas
of three public roadside lidar datasets: LUMPI, V2X-Real-IC, and TUMTraf-I.
Each UrbanTwin dataset contains 10K annotated frames corresponding to one of
the public datasets. Annotations include 3D bounding boxes, instance
segmentation labels, and tracking IDs for six object classes, along with
semantic segmentation labels for nine classes. These datasets are synthesized
using emulated lidar sensors within realistic digital twins, modeled based on
surrounding geometry, road alignment at lane level, and the lane topology and
vehicle movement patterns at intersections of the actual locations
corresponding to each real dataset. Due to the precise digital twin modeling,
the synthetic datasets are well aligned with their real counterparts, offering
strong standalone and augmentative value for training deep learning models on
tasks such as 3D object detection, tracking, and semantic and instance
segmentation. We evaluate the alignment of the synthetic replicas through
statistical and structural similarity analysis with real data, and further
demonstrate their utility by training 3D object detection models solely on
synthetic data and testing them on real, unseen data. The high similarity
scores and improved detection performance, compared to the models trained on
real data, indicate that the UrbanTwin datasets effectively enhance existing
benchmark datasets by increasing sample size and scene diversity. In addition,
the digital twins can be adapted to test custom scenarios by modifying the
design and dynamics of the simulations. To our knowledge, these are the first
digitally synthesized datasets that can replace in-domain real-world datasets
for lidar perception tasks. UrbanTwin datasets are publicly available at

Abstract: Segmenting 3D assets into their constituent parts is crucial for enhancing 3D
understanding, facilitating model reuse, and supporting various applications
such as part generation. However, current methods face limitations such as poor

feature extractor, multiple segmentation heads, and an IoU predictor, enabling
interactive segmentation for users. We also propose an algorithm to
automatically select and merge masks predicted by our model for part instance
segmentation. Our model is trained on a newly built dataset containing nearly
3.7 million models with reasonable segmentation labels. Comparisons show that
our method achieves precise segmentation results and strong robustness on any
complex objects, attaining state-of-the-art performance. Our code will be

Abstract: In the field of autonomous driving, sensor simulation is essential for
generating rare and diverse scenarios that are difficult to capture in
real-world environments. Current solutions fall into two categories: 1)
CG-based methods, such as CARLA, which lack diversity and struggle to scale to
the vast array of rare cases required for robust perception training; and 2)
learning-based approaches, such as NeuSim, which are limited to specific object
categories (vehicles) and require extensive multi-sensor data, hindering their
applicability to generic objects. To address these limitations, we propose a
scalable real2sim2real system that leverages 3D generation to automate asset
mining, generation, and rare-case data synthesis.

Motivation: 人类对脸部更敏感，现有图像定制方法在多参考图像中难以保持身份一致性且容易产生身份混淆，限制了身份可扩展性。

Method: 提出UMO框架，将多身份生成重新表述为全局分配优化问题，通过扩散模型上的强化学习实现多身份一致性，并构建了包含合成和真实数据的可扩展定制数据集。

Result: 大量实验表明UMO显著提高了身份一致性，减少了身份混淆，在身份保持维度上达到了开源方法的新最先进水平。

Conclusion: UMO有效解决了多身份图像定制中的身份混淆问题，为现有图像定制方法提供了通用的多身份一致性解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in image customization exhibit a wide range of
application prospects due to stronger customization capabilities. However,
since we humans are more sensitive to faces, a significant challenge remains in
preserving consistent identity while avoiding identity confusion with
multi-reference images, limiting the identity scalability of customization
models. To address this, we present UMO, a Unified Multi-identity Optimization
framework, designed to maintain high-fidelity identity preservation and
alleviate identity confusion with scalability. With "multi-to-multi matching"
paradigm, UMO reformulates multi-identity generation as a global assignment
optimization problem and unleashes multi-identity consistency for existing
image customization methods generally through reinforcement learning on
diffusion models. To facilitate the training of UMO, we develop a scalable
customization dataset with multi-reference images, consisting of both
synthesised and real parts. Additionally, we propose a new metric to measure
identity confusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UMO not only
improves identity consistency significantly, but also reduces identity
confusion on several image customization methods, setting a new
state-of-the-art among open-source methods along the dimension of identity
preserving. Code and model: https://github.com/bytedance/UMO

TL;DR: 基于对比学习的视频年龄分级分类方法，使用LRCN+注意力机制，在Contextual Contrastive Learning框架下达到88%准确率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法需要大量标注数据、泛化能力差且特征学习效率低，无法满足视频内容年龄分级自动化的需求

Method: 采用对比学习（实例判别、上下文对比、多视图对比三种框架），结合LRCN（CNN+LSTM）骨干网络和Bahdanau注意力机制

Result: 在Contextual Contrastive Learning框架下达到88%准确率和0.8815 F1分数，能够有效区分PG-13和R级内容

Conclusion: 提出的混合架构在对比学习框架下表现出色，已部署为实时MPAA分级分类的Web应用，为流媒体平台提供自动化内容合规解决方案

Abstract: The rapid growth of visual content consumption across platforms necessitates
automated video classification for age-suitability standards like the MPAA
rating system (G, PG, PG-13, R). Traditional methods struggle with large
labeled data requirements, poor generalization, and inefficient feature
learning. To address these challenges, we employ contrastive learning for
improved discrimination and adaptability, exploring three frameworks: Instance
Discrimination, Contextual Contrastive Learning, and Multi-View Contrastive
Learning. Our hybrid architecture integrates an LRCN (CNN+LSTM) backbone with a
Bahdanau attention mechanism, achieving state-of-the-art performance in the
Contextual Contrastive Learning framework, with 88% accuracy and an F1 score of
0.8815. By combining CNNs for spatial features, LSTMs for temporal modeling,
and attention mechanisms for dynamic frame prioritization, the model excels in
fine-grained borderline distinctions, such as differentiating PG-13 and R-rated
content. We evaluate the model's performance across various contrastive loss
functions, including NT-Xent, NT-logistic, and Margin Triplet, demonstrating
the robustness of our proposed architecture. To ensure practical application,
the model is deployed as a web application for real-time MPAA rating
classification, offering an efficient solution for automated content compliance
across streaming platforms.

Motivation: 当前AI辅助放射学诊断主要基于单一任务的窄模型，无法覆盖广泛的影像模态、疾病和放射学发现。基础模型在放射学领域的潜力尚未充分发挥

Method: 使用一家大型医院数年的全部横断面影像输出（15万次检查，130TB数据）训练Curia基础模型，并在新构建的19任务外部验证基准上进行评估

Result: Curia能够准确识别器官、检测脑出血和心肌梗死等疾病、预测肿瘤分期结果，在跨模态和低数据场景下展现出临床显著的涌现特性

Conclusion: Curia证明了基础模型在放射学中的巨大潜力，为加速该领域发展，作者在Hugging Face上发布了模型权重

Abstract: AI-assisted radiological interpretation is based on predominantly narrow,
single-task models. This approach is impractical for covering the vast spectrum
of imaging modalities, diseases, and radiological findings. Foundation models
(FMs) hold the promise of broad generalization across modalities and in
low-data settings. However, this potential has remained largely unrealized in
radiology. We introduce Curia, a foundation model trained on the entire
cross-sectional imaging output of a major hospital over several years, which to
our knowledge is the largest such corpus of real-world data-encompassing
150,000 exams (130 TB). On a newly curated 19-task external validation
benchmark, Curia accurately identifies organs, detects conditions like brain
hemorrhages and myocardial infarctions, and predicts outcomes in tumor staging.
Curia meets or surpasses the performance of radiologists and recent foundation
models, and exhibits clinically significant emergent properties in
cross-modality, and low-data regimes. To accelerate progress, we release our
base model's weights at https://huggingface.co/raidium/curia.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索通过基础模型的领域适配和多模态数据整合来提升外科手术数据科学的表现。

Method: 使用V-JEPA作为基础模型，在未标注的外科手术视频上进行微调，并整合手术室的其他时间分辨数据流构建多模态模型。

Result: 领域特定数据的微调显著提升了模型性能，多模态数据的整合在内部数据集上同样有效。在HeiCo数据集上，基线模型的准确率已等同于EndoVis2017挑战赛的最佳汇报。

Conclusion: 这些结果证明了通过基础模型的领域适配和整合相关数据流来提升外科手术数据科学的潜力。

Abstract: We investigate how both the adaptation of a generic foundation model via
transfer learning and the integration of complementary modalities from the
operating room (OR) can support surgical data science. To this end, we use
V-JEPA as the single-modality foundation of a multimodal model for minimally
invasive surgery support. We analyze how the model's downstream performance can
benefit (a) from finetuning on unlabeled surgical video data and (b) from
providing additional time-resolved data streams from the OR in a multimodal
setup.
  In an in-house dataset of liver surgery videos, we analyze the tasks of
predicting hospital length of stay and postoperative complications. In videos
of the public HeiCo dataset, we analyze the task of surgical phase recognition.
As a baseline, we apply pretrained V-JEPA to all tasks. We then finetune it on
unlabeled, held-out videos to investigate its change in performance after
domain adaptation. Following the idea of modular decision support networks, we
integrate additional data streams from the OR by training a separate encoder to
form a shared representation space with V-JEPA's embeddings.
  Our experiments show that finetuning on domain-specific data increases model
performance. On the in-house data, integrating additional time-resolved data
likewise benefits the model. On the HeiCo data, accuracy of the pretrained
video-only, single-modality baseline setup is on par with the top-performing
submissions of the EndoVis2017 challenge, while finetuning on domain-specific
data increases accuracy further. Our results thus demonstrate how surgical data
science can leverage public, generic foundation models. Likewise, they indicate
the potential of domain adaptation and of integrating suitable complementary
data streams from the OR. To support further research, we release our code and
model weights at https://github.com/DigitalSurgeryLab-Basel/ML-CDS-2025.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Abstract: Assessing the severity of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) using the Total Sharp/Van
Der Heijde Score (TSS) is crucial, but manual scoring is often time-consuming
and subjective. This study introduces an Automated Radiographic Sharp Scoring
(ARTSS) framework that leverages deep learning to analyze full-hand X-ray
images, aiming to reduce inter- and intra-observer variability. The research
uniquely accommodates patients with joint disappearance and variable-length
image sequences. We developed ARTSS using data from 970 patients, structured
into four stages: I) Image pre-processing and re-orientation using ResNet50,
II) Hand segmentation using UNet.3, III) Joint identification using YOLOv7, and
IV) TSS prediction using models such as VGG16, VGG19, ResNet50, DenseNet201,
EfficientNetB0, and Vision Transformer (ViT). We evaluated model performance
with Intersection over Union (IoU), Mean Average Precision (MAP), mean absolute
error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Huber loss. The average TSS
from two radiologists was used as the ground truth. Model training employed
3-fold cross-validation, with each fold consisting of 452 training and 227
validation samples, and external testing included 291 unseen subjects. Our
joint identification model achieved 99% accuracy. The best-performing model,
ViT, achieved a notably low Huber loss of 0.87 for TSS prediction. Our results
demonstrate the potential of deep learning to automate RA scoring, which can
significantly enhance clinical practice. Our approach addresses the challenge
of joint disappearance and variable joint numbers, offers timesaving benefits,
reduces inter- and intra-reader variability, improves radiologist accuracy, and
aids rheumatologists in making more informed decisions.

Motivation: 解决现实场景中多视角重建产生的拓扑瑕疵问题，当前方法基于等距或ARAP变形的假设在这些拓扑配置下不成立。

Method: 联合优化具有适当拓扑的模板网格及其与待匹配形状的对齐，使用拓扑自适应变形模型在ARAP和双射关联约束下进行形状对齐。

Result: 方法适用于高度非等距形状和含拓扑瑕疵的形状，包括噪声多视角重建，在3D对齐质量上甚至优于基于大数据训练的方法。

Conclusion: 提出的拓扑自适应变形模型有效解决了含拓扑瑕疵的3D网格匹配问题，无需依赖数据驱动先验，在真实场景中表现出色。

Abstract: Non-rigid 3D mesh matching is a critical step in computer vision and computer
graphics pipelines. We tackle matching meshes that contain topological
artefacts which can break the assumption made by current approaches. While
Functional Maps assume the deformation induced by the ground truth
correspondences to be near-isometric, ARAP-like deformation-guided approaches
assume the latter to be ARAP. Neither assumption holds in certain topological
configurations of the input shapes. We are motivated by real-world scenarios
such as per-frame multi-view reconstructions, often suffering from topological
artefacts. To this end, we propose a topology-adaptive deformation model
allowing changes in shape topology to align shape pairs under ARAP and
bijective association constraints. Using this model, we jointly optimise for a
template mesh with adequate topology and for its alignment with the shapes to
be matched to extract correspondences. We show that, while not relying on any
data-driven prior, our approach applies to highly non-isometric shapes and
shapes with topological artefacts, including noisy per-frame multi-view
reconstructions, even outperforming methods trained on large datasets in 3D
alignment quality.

Motivation: 自动车牌识别系统在智慧城市中至关重要，但面临高变化性和模糊图像的挑战，需要更有效的深度学习方案来提升性能。

Method: 采用选择性GAN进行去模糊预处理，结合YOLOv5对象检测架构进行车牌检测、字符分割和字符识别，避免不必要的输入操作。

Conclusion: 结合YOLOv5和Deblur-GAN的方案在保持高准确性的同时实现了快速实时处理，特别适合处理模糊车牌图像的移动应用场景。

Abstract: Automatic License-Plate Recognition (ALPR) plays a pivotal role in
Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) as a fundamental element of Smart
Cities. However, due to its high variability, ALPR faces challenging issues
more efficiently addressed by deep learning techniques. In this paper, a
selective Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is proposed for deblurring in
the preprocessing step, coupled with the state-of-the-art You-Only-Look-Once
(YOLO)v5 object detection architectures for License-Plate Detection (LPD), and
the integrated Character Segmentation (CS) and Character Recognition (CR)
steps. The selective preprocessing bypasses unnecessary and sometimes
counter-productive input manipulations, while YOLOv5 LPD/CS+CR delivers high
accuracy and low computing cost. As a result, YOLOv5 achieves a detection time
of 0.026 seconds for both LP and CR detection stages, facilitating real-time
applications with exceptionally rapid responsiveness. Moreover, the proposed
model achieves accuracy rates of 95\% and 97\% in the LPD and CR detection
phases, respectively. Furthermore, the inclusion of the Deblur-GAN
pre-processor significantly improves detection accuracy by nearly 40\%,
especially when encountering blurred License Plates (LPs).To train and test the
learning components, we generated and publicly released our blur and ALPR
datasets (using Iranian license plates as a use-case), which are more
representative of close-to-real-life ad-hoc situations. The findings
demonstrate that employing the state-of-the-art YOLO model results in excellent
overall precision and detection time, making it well-suited for portable
applications. Additionally, integrating the Deblur-GAN model as a preliminary
processing step enhances the overall effectiveness of our comprehensive model,
particularly when confronted with blurred scenes captured by the camera as
input.

Conclusion: 该轻量级模型为医学图像分割提供了一种实用的实时解决方案，在减少计算成本的同时保持了分割精度，具有良好的临床部署潜力。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is a critical task in clinical workflows,
particularly for the detection and delineation of pathological regions. While
convolutional architectures like U-Net have become standard for such tasks,
their limited receptive field restricts global context modeling. Recent efforts
integrating transformers have addressed this, but often result in deep,
computationally expensive models unsuitable for real-time use. In this work, we
present a novel end-to-end lightweight architecture designed specifically for
real-time binary medical image segmentation. Our model combines a Swin
Transformer-like encoder with a U-Net-like decoder, connected via skip pathways
to preserve spatial detail while capturing contextual information. Unlike
existing designs such as Swin Transformer or U-Net, our architecture is
significantly shallower and competitively efficient. To improve the encoder's
ability to learn meaningful features without relying on large amounts of
labeled data, we first train it using Barlow Twins, a self-supervised learning
method that helps the model focus on important patterns by reducing unnecessary
repetition in the learned features. After this pretraining, we fine-tune the
entire model for our specific task. Experiments on benchmark binary
segmentation tasks demonstrate that our model achieves competitive accuracy
with substantially reduced parameter count and faster inference, positioning it
as a practical alternative for deployment in real-time and resource-limited
clinical environments. The code for our method is available at Github
repository: https://github.com/mkianih/Barlow-Swin.

Motivation: 现有的欧几里得近似方法扭曲了流形结构并减慢了收敛速度，需要更好的方法来捕捉复杂的流形结构以提高配准性能。

Method: 使用CNN-Transformer编码器提取特征嵌入，将其投影到球形空间，在双不变SO(4)空间中用黎曼距离近似测地距离，并采用可微分的Levenberg-Marquardt优化加速收敛。

Result: 在真实和合成数据集上的实验显示，该方法在患者特定和患者无关场景下都表现出更高的准确性。

Conclusion: 在非欧几里得球形特征空间中学习相似性能够更好地捕捉复杂流形结构，提供更具表达力和几何一致性的深度相似性度量，显著提高了2D/3D配准的性能。

Abstract: Intraoperative 2D/3D registration aligns preoperative 3D volumes with
real-time 2D radiographs, enabling accurate localization of instruments and
implants. A recent fully differentiable similarity learning framework
approximates geodesic distances on SE(3), expanding the capture range of
registration and mitigating the effects of substantial disturbances, but
existing Euclidean approximations distort manifold structure and slow
convergence. To address these limitations, we explore similarity learning in
non-Euclidean spherical feature spaces to better capture and fit complex
manifold structure. We extract feature embeddings using a CNN-Transformer
encoder, project them into spherical space, and approximate their geodesic
distances with Riemannian distances in the bi-invariant SO(4) space. This
enables a more expressive and geometrically consistent deep similarity metric,
enhancing the ability to distinguish subtle pose differences. During inference,
we replace gradient descent with fully differentiable Levenberg-Marquardt
optimization to accelerate convergence. Experiments on real and synthetic
datasets show superior accuracy in both patient-specific and patient-agnostic
scenarios.

Abstract: This paper introduces BIR-Adapter, a low-complexity blind image restoration
adapter for diffusion models. The BIR-Adapter enables the utilization of the
prior of pre-trained large-scale diffusion models on blind image restoration
without training any auxiliary feature extractor. We take advantage of the
robustness of pretrained models. We extract features from degraded images via
the model itself and extend the self-attention mechanism with these degraded
features. We introduce a sampling guidance mechanism to reduce hallucinations.
We perform experiments on synthetic and real-world degradations and demonstrate
that BIR-Adapter achieves competitive or better performance compared to
state-of-the-art methods while having significantly lower complexity.
Additionally, its adapter-based design enables integration into other diffusion
models, enabling broader applications in image restoration tasks. We showcase
this by extending a super-resolution-only model to perform better under
additional unknown degradations.

Abstract: Vision-driven field monitoring is central to digital agriculture, yet models
built on general-domain pretrained backbones often fail to generalize across
tasks, owing to the interaction of fine, variable canopy structures with
fluctuating field conditions. We present FoMo4Wheat, one of the first
crop-domain vision foundation model pretrained with self-supervision on
ImAg4Wheat, the largest and most diverse wheat image dataset to date (2.5
million high-resolution images collected over a decade at 30 global sites,
spanning >2,000 genotypes and >500 environmental conditions). This
wheat-specific pretraining yields representations that are robust for wheat and
transferable to other crops and weeds. Across ten in-field vision tasks at
canopy and organ levels, FoMo4Wheat models consistently outperform
state-of-the-art models pretrained on general-domain dataset. These results
demonstrate the value of crop-specific foundation models for reliable in-field
perception and chart a path toward a universal crop foundation model with
cross-species and cross-task capabilities. FoMo4Wheat models and the ImAg4Wheat

Abstract: Unified multimodal understanding and generation models recently have achieve
significant improvement in image generation capability, yet a large gap remains
in instruction following and detail preservation compared to systems that
tightly couple comprehension with generation such as GPT-4o. Motivated by
recent advances in interleaving reasoning, we explore whether such reasoning
can further improve Text-to-Image (T2I) generation. We introduce Interleaving
Reasoning Generation (IRG), a framework that alternates between text-based
thinking and image synthesis: the model first produces a text-based thinking to
guide an initial image, then reflects on the result to refine fine-grained
details, visual quality, and aesthetics while preserving semantics. To train
IRG effectively, we propose Interleaving Reasoning Generation Learning (IRGL),
which targets two sub-goals: (1) strengthening the initial think-and-generate
stage to establish core content and base quality, and (2) enabling high-quality
textual reflection and faithful implementation of those refinements in a
subsequent image. We curate IRGL-300K, a dataset organized into six decomposed
learning modes that jointly cover learning text-based thinking, and full
thinking-image trajectories. Starting from a unified foundation model that
natively emits interleaved text-image outputs, our two-stage training first
builds robust thinking and reflection, then efficiently tunes the IRG pipeline
in the full thinking-image trajectory data. Extensive experiments show SoTA
performance, yielding absolute gains of 5-10 points on GenEval, WISE, TIIF,
GenAI-Bench, and OneIG-EN, alongside substantial improvements in visual quality
and fine-grained fidelity. The code, model weights and datasets will be
released in: https://github.com/Osilly/Interleaving-Reasoning-Generation .

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: H₂OT是一种分层插换式的剪枝恢复框架，通过动态剪枝冗余帧的姿态token并在后期恢复完整序列，提高视频3D人体姿势估计变磨型的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频姿态变磨型(VPTs)计算成本高，在资源受限设备上实用性差，需要一种高效的加速方法。

Method: 设计了两个核心模块：Token Pruning Module(TPM)动态选择代表性token消除冗余，Token Recovering Module(TRM)基于选中token恢复详细时空信息。支持不同的剪枝恢复策略和seq2seq/seq2frame流水线。

Result: 在多个标准数据集上证明方法既高效又准确，维护完整姿态序列并非必要，少量代表性帧的token即可实现良好效果。

Conclusion: H₂OT框架能够显著提高VPT模型的效率，同时保持估计准确性，具有良好的应用前景。

Abstract: Transformers have been successfully applied in the field of video-based 3D
human pose estimation. However, the high computational costs of these video
pose transformers (VPTs) make them impractical on resource-constrained devices.
In this paper, we present a hierarchical plug-and-play pruning-and-recovering
framework, called Hierarchical Hourglass Tokenizer (H$_{2}$OT), for efficient
transformer-based 3D human pose estimation from videos. H$_{2}$OT begins with
progressively pruning pose tokens of redundant frames and ends with recovering
full-length sequences, resulting in a few pose tokens in the intermediate
transformer blocks and thus improving the model efficiency. It works with two
key modules, namely, a Token Pruning Module (TPM) and a Token Recovering Module
(TRM). TPM dynamically selects a few representative tokens to eliminate the
redundancy of video frames, while TRM restores the detailed spatio-temporal
information based on the selected tokens, thereby expanding the network output
to the original full-length temporal resolution for fast inference. Our method
is general-purpose: it can be easily incorporated into common VPT models on
both seq2seq and seq2frame pipelines while effectively accommodating different
token pruning and recovery strategies. In addition, our H$_{2}$OT reveals that
maintaining the full pose sequence is unnecessary, and a few pose tokens of
representative frames can achieve both high efficiency and estimation accuracy.
Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate both the
effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method. Code and models are
available at https://github.com/NationalGAILab/HoT.

Abstract: Reducing the triangle count in complex 3D models is a basic geometry
preprocessing step in graphics pipelines such as efficient rendering and
interactive editing. However, most existing mesh simplification methods exhibit
a few issues. Firstly, they often lead to self-intersections during decimation,
a major issue for applications such as 3D printing and soft-body simulation.
Second, to perform simplification on a mesh in the wild, one would first need
to perform re-meshing, which often suffers from surface shifts and losses of
sharp features. Finally, existing re-meshing and simplification methods can
take minutes when processing large-scale meshes, limiting their applications in
practice. To address the challenges, we introduce a novel GPU-based mesh
optimization approach containing three key components: (1) a parallel
re-meshing algorithm to turn meshes in the wild into watertight, manifold, and
intersection-free ones, and reduce the prevalence of poorly shaped triangles;
(2) a robust parallel simplification algorithm with intersection-free
guarantees; (3) an optimization-based safe projection algorithm to realign the
simplified mesh with the input, eliminating the surface shift introduced by
re-meshing and recovering the original sharp features. The algorithm
demonstrates remarkable efficiency, simplifying a 2-million-face mesh to 20k
triangles in 3 seconds on RTX4090. We evaluated the approach on the Thingi10K
dataset and showcased its exceptional performance in geometry preservation and
speed.

Abstract: Each element in tensioned structural networks -- such as tensegrity,
architectural fabrics, or medical braces/meshes -- requires a specific tension
level to achieve and maintain the desired shape, stability, and compliance.
These structures are challenging to manufacture, 3D print, or assemble because
flattening the network during fabrication introduces multiplicative
inaccuracies in the network's final tension gradients. This study overcomes
this challenge by offering a fabrication algorithm for direct 3D printing of
such networks with programmed tension gradients, an approach analogous to the
spinning of spiderwebs. The algorithm: (i) defines the desired network and
prescribes its tension gradients using the force density method; (ii) converts
the network into an unstretched counterpart by numerically optimizing vertex
locations toward target element lengths and converting straight elements into
arcs to resolve any remaining error; and (iii) decomposes the network into
printable toolpaths; Optional additional steps are: (iv) flattening curved 2D
networks or 3D networks to ensure 3D printing compatibility; and (v)
automatically resolving any unwanted crossings introduced by the flattening
process. The proposed method is experimentally validated using 2D unit cells of
viscoelastic filaments, where accurate tension gradients are achieved with an
average element strain error of less than 1.0\%. The method remains effective
for networks with element minimum length and maximum stress of 5.8 mm and 7.3
MPa, respectively. The method is used to demonstrate the fabrication of three
complex cases: a flat spiderweb, a curved mesh, and a tensegrity system. The
programmable tension gradient algorithm can be utilized to produce compact,
integrated cable networks, enabling novel applications such as moment-exerting
structures in medical braces and splints.

TL;DR: 结合骨骼动画和视频滿散模型的混合动画系统，通过基于inpainting的细芯提升和二级动态注入策略，解决手绘字符动画中的几何不一致性和变形问题。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的混合动画系统有效结合了骨骼动画的几何一致性优势和视频滿散模型的动态生成能力，通过SDI策略和HLM技术解决了非架构元素的自然动画问题，为手绘字符动画领域提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Hand-drawn character animation is a vibrant field in computer graphics,
presenting challenges in achieving geometric consistency while conveying
expressive motion. Traditional skeletal animation methods maintain geometric
consistency but struggle with complex non-rigid elements like flowing hair and
skirts, leading to unnatural deformation. Conversely, video diffusion models
synthesize realistic dynamics but often create geometric distortions in
stylized drawings due to domain gaps. This work proposes a hybrid animation
system that combines skeletal animation and video diffusion. Initially, coarse
images are generated from characters retargeted with skeletal animations for
geometric guidance. These images are then enhanced in texture and secondary
dynamics using video diffusion priors, framing this enhancement as an
inpainting task. A domain-adapted diffusion model refines user-masked regions
needing improvement, especially for secondary dynamics. To enhance motion
realism further, we introduce a Secondary Dynamics Injection (SDI) strategy in
the denoising process, incorporating features from a pre-trained diffusion
model enriched with human motion priors. Additionally, to tackle unnatural
deformations from low-poly single-mesh character modeling, we present a Hair
Layering Modeling (HLM) technique that uses segmentation maps to separate hair
from the body, allowing for more natural animation of long-haired characters.
Extensive experiments show that our system outperforms state-of-the-art methods
in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

TL;DR: SKEL是一个新的参数化3D人体模型，通过将SMPL模型重新绑定到生物力学准确的骨骼结构上，解决了现有模型在生物力学准确性方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的人体模型（如SMPL）具有简化的运动学结构，与真实人体骨骼系统的关节位置和关节结构不符，限制了其在生物力学中的应用。需要一种具有生物力学准确骨骼结构且易于摆姿的参数化3D人体模型。

Method: 1）通过优化AMASS序列中的SMPL网格内部的生物力学准确骨骼来构建数据集；2）学习从SMPL网格顶点到优化关节位置和骨骼旋转的回归器；3）用新的运动学参数重新参数化SMPL网格。

Result: SKEL模型比SMPL具有更生物力学准确的关节位置，骨骼更好地贴合在身体表面内部。能够将现有的人体姿态和形状数据集"升级"为包含生物力学参数。

Conclusion: SKEL提供了一个新工具，使得在野外环境中进行生物力学研究成为可能，同时为视觉和图形学研究人员提供了更好约束和更真实的人体关节模型。

Abstract: Great progress has been made in estimating 3D human pose and shape from
images and video by training neural networks to directly regress the parameters
of parametric human models like SMPL. However, existing body models have
simplified kinematic structures that do not correspond to the true joint
locations and articulations in the human skeletal system, limiting their
potential use in biomechanics. On the other hand, methods for estimating
biomechanically accurate skeletal motion typically rely on complex motion
capture systems and expensive optimization methods. What is needed is a
parametric 3D human model with a biomechanically accurate skeletal structure
that can be easily posed. To that end, we develop SKEL, which re-rigs the SMPL
body model with a biomechanics skeleton. To enable this, we need training data
of skeletons inside SMPL meshes in diverse poses.
  We build such a dataset by optimizing biomechanically accurate skeletons
inside SMPL meshes from AMASS sequences. We then learn a regressor from SMPL
mesh vertices to the optimized joint locations and bone rotations. Finally, we
re-parametrize the SMPL mesh with the new kinematic parameters. The resulting
SKEL model is animatable like SMPL but with fewer, and
biomechanically-realistic, degrees of freedom. We show that SKEL has more
biomechanically accurate joint locations than SMPL, and the bones fit inside
the body surface better than previous methods. By fitting SKEL to SMPL meshes
we are able to "upgrade" existing human pose and shape datasets to include
biomechanical parameters. SKEL provides a new tool to enable biomechanics in
the wild, while also providing vision and graphics researchers with a better
constrained and more realistic model of human articulation. The model, code,
and data are available for research at https://skel.is.tue.mpg.de..

Abstract: Large transformer-based models have made significant progress in
generalizable novel view synthesis (NVS) from sparse input views, generating
novel viewpoints without the need for test-time optimization. However, these
models are constrained by the limited diversity of publicly available scene
datasets, making most real-world (in-the-wild) scenes out-of-distribution. To
overcome this, we incorporate synthetic training data generated from diffusion
models, which improves generalization across unseen domains. While synthetic
data offers scalability, we identify artifacts introduced during data
generation as a key bottleneck affecting reconstruction quality. To address
this, we propose a token disentanglement process within the transformer
architecture, enhancing feature separation and ensuring more effective
learning. This refinement not only improves reconstruction quality over
standard transformers but also enables scalable training with synthetic data.
As a result, our method outperforms existing models on both in-dataset and
cross-dataset evaluations, achieving state-of-the-art results across multiple
benchmarks while significantly reducing computational costs. Project page:

Abstract: Data scarcity continues to be a major challenge in the field of robotic
manipulation. Although diffusion models provide a promising solution for
generating robotic manipulation videos, existing methods largely depend on 2D
trajectories, which inherently face issues with 3D spatial ambiguity. In this
work, we present a novel framework named ManipDreamer3D for generating
plausible 3D-aware robotic manipulation videos from the input image and the
text instruction. Our method combines 3D trajectory planning with a
reconstructed 3D occupancy map created from a third-person perspective, along
with a novel trajectory-to-video diffusion model. Specifically, ManipDreamer3D
first reconstructs the 3D occupancy representation from the input image and
then computes an optimized 3D end-effector trajectory, minimizing path length
while avoiding collisions. Next, we employ a latent editing technique to create
video sequences from the initial image latent and the optimized 3D trajectory.
This process conditions our specially trained trajectory-to-video diffusion
model to produce robotic pick-and-place videos. Our method generates robotic
videos with autonomously planned plausible 3D trajectories, significantly
reducing human intervention requirements. Experimental results demonstrate
superior visual quality compared to existing methods.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs) has pushed their
boundaries to many applications in various domains. Recently, the research
community has started to evaluate their potential adoption in autonomous
vehicles and especially as complementary modules in the perception and planning
software stacks. However, their evaluation is limited in synthetic datasets or
manually driving datasets without the ground truth knowledge and more
precisely, how the current perception and planning algorithms would perform in
the cases under evaluation. For this reason, this work evaluates LLMs on
real-world edge cases where current autonomous vehicles have been proven to
fail. The proposed architecture consists of an open vocabulary object detector
coupled with prompt engineering and large language model contextual reasoning.
We evaluate several state-of-the-art models against real edge cases and provide
qualitative comparison results along with a discussion on the findings for the
potential application of LLMs as anomaly detectors in autonomous vehicles.

Abstract: We introduce Plantbot, a hybrid lifeform that connects a living plant with a
mobile robot through a network of large language model (LLM) modules. Each
module - responsible for sensing, vision, dialogue, or action - operates
asynchronously and communicates via natural language, enabling seamless
interaction across biological and artificial domains. This architecture
leverages the capacity of LLMs to serve as hybrid interfaces, where natural
language functions as a universal protocol, translating multimodal data (soil
moisture, temperature, visual context) into linguistic messages that coordinate
system behaviors. The integrated network transforms plant states into robotic
actions, installing normativity essential for agency within the sensor-motor
loop. By combining biological and robotic elements through LLM-mediated
communication, Plantbot behaves as an embodied, adaptive agent capable of
responding autonomously to environmental conditions. This approach suggests
possibilities for a new model of artificial life, where decentralized, LLM
modules coordination enable novel interactions between biological and

Abstract: We introduce a general, scalable computational framework for multi-axis 3D
printing based on implicit neural fields (INFs) that unifies all stages of
toolpath generation and global collision-free motion planning. In our pipeline,
input models are represented as signed distance fields, with fabrication
objectives such as support-free printing, surface finish quality, and extrusion
control being directly encoded in the optimization of an implicit guidance
field. This unified approach enables toolpath optimization across both surface
and interior domains, allowing shell and infill paths to be generated via
implicit field interpolation. The printing sequence and multi-axis motion are
then jointly optimized over a continuous quaternion field. Our continuous
formulation constructs the evolving printing object as a time-varying SDF,
supporting differentiable global collision handling throughout INF-based motion
planning. Compared to explicit-representation-based methods, INF-3DP achieves
up to two orders of magnitude speedup and significantly reduces
waypoint-to-surface error. We validate our framework on diverse, complex models
and demonstrate its efficiency with physical fabrication experiments using a
robot-assisted multi-axis system.

Abstract: The deployment of autonomous drone swarms in disaster response missions
necessitates the development of flexible, scalable, and robust coordination
systems. Traditional fixed architectures struggle to cope with dynamic and
unpredictable environments, leading to inefficiencies in energy consumption and
connectivity. This paper addresses this gap by proposing an adaptive

select the optimal architecture as centralized, hierarchical, or holonic based
on real time mission parameters such as task complexity, swarm size, and
communication stability. Our system addresses the challenges of scalability,
adaptability, and robustness,ensuring efficient energy consumption and
maintaining connectivity under varying conditions. Extensive simulations
demonstrate that our adaptive architecture outperforms traditional static

results highlight the potential of our approach to provide a scalable,

Abstract: Despite recent progress in training spiking neural networks (SNNs) for
classification, their application to continuous motor control remains limited.
Here, we demonstrate that fully spiking architectures can be trained end-to-end
to control robotic arms with multiple degrees of freedom in continuous
environments. Our predictive-control framework combines Leaky
Integrate-and-Fire dynamics with surrogate gradients, jointly optimizing a
forward model for dynamics prediction and a policy network for goal-directed
action. We evaluate this approach on both a planar 2D reaching task and a
simulated 6-DOF Franka Emika Panda robot. Results show that SNNs can achieve
stable training and accurate torque control, establishing their viability for
high-dimensional motor tasks. An extensive ablation study highlights the role
of initialization, learnable time constants, and regularization in shaping
training dynamics. We conclude that while stable and effective control can be
achieved, recurrent spiking networks remain highly sensitive to hyperparameter
settings, underscoring the importance of principled design choices.

Abstract: Learning from long-horizon demonstrations with complex action sequences
presents significant challenges for visual imitation learning, particularly in
understanding temporal relationships of actions and spatial relationships
between objects. In this paper, we propose a new agent framework that
incorporates two dedicated reflection modules to enhance both plan and code
generation. The plan generation module produces an initial action sequence,
which is then verified by the plan reflection module to ensure temporal
coherence and spatial alignment with the demonstration video. The code
generation module translates the plan into executable code, while the code
reflection module verifies and refines the generated code to ensure correctness
and consistency with the generated plan. These two reflection modules jointly
enable the agent to detect and correct errors in both the plan generation and
code generation, improving performance in tasks with intricate temporal and
spatial dependencies. To support systematic evaluation, we introduce
LongVILBench, a benchmark comprising 300 human demonstrations with action
sequences of up to 18 steps. LongVILBench emphasizes temporal and spatial
complexity across multiple task types. Experimental results demonstrate that
existing methods perform poorly on this benchmark, whereas our new framework
establishes a strong baseline for long-horizon visual imitation learning.

Result: 在8台机器人执行40个到达任务的环境中，实现了零样本迁移，并支持工作单元布局优化、故障容锐规划和在线重新规划。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了高速、可扩展的解决方案，为多机器人系统的自动化规划开启了新可能性。

Abstract: Modern robotic manufacturing requires collision-free coordination of multiple
robots to complete numerous tasks in shared, obstacle-rich workspaces. Although
individual tasks may be simple in isolation, automated joint task allocation,
scheduling, and motion planning under spatio-temporal constraints remain
computationally intractable for classical methods at real-world scales.
Existing multi-arm systems deployed in the industry rely on human intuition and
experience to design feasible trajectories manually in a labor-intensive
process. To address this challenge, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL)
framework to achieve automated task and motion planning, tested in an
obstacle-rich environment with eight robots performing 40 reaching tasks in a
shared workspace, where any robot can perform any task in any order. Our
approach builds on a graph neural network (GNN) policy trained via RL on
procedurally-generated environments with diverse obstacle layouts, robot
configurations, and task distributions. It employs a graph representation of
scenes and a graph policy neural network trained through reinforcement learning
to generate trajectories of multiple robots, jointly solving the sub-problems
of task allocation, scheduling, and motion planning. Trained on large randomly
generated task sets in simulation, our policy generalizes zero-shot to unseen
settings with varying robot placements, obstacle geometries, and task poses. We
further demonstrate that the high-speed capability of our solution enables its
use in workcell layout optimization, improving solution times. The speed and
scalability of our planner also open the door to new capabilities such as
fault-tolerant planning and online perception-based re-planning, where rapid
adaptation to dynamic task sets is required.

Motivation: 现有触觉系统通常只能渲染几何特征或机械属性，难以在可穿戴设备中同时实现多种物理属性的调制，这限制了人机交互的丰富性和真实感。

Method: 采用拮抗式织物气动执行器(AFPAs)的气动框架，通过双腔压力调节实现尺寸和刚度的解耦控制，并开发了可扩展架构结合其他气动结构。

Conclusion: 拮抗式气动原理为下一代触觉界面提供了可行路径，能够在实际可穿戴约束下实现多维渲染特性。

Abstract: Haptic interfaces that can simultaneously modulate multiple physical
properties remain a fundamental challenge in human-robot interaction. Existing
systems typically allow the rendering of either geometric features or
mechanical properties, but rarely both, within wearable form factors. Here, we
introduce HapMorph, a pneumatic framework that enables continuous, simultaneous
modulation of object size and stiffness through antagonistic fabric-based
pneumatic actuators (AFPAs). We implemented a HapMorph protoytpe designed for
hands interaction achieving size variation from 50 to 104 mm, stiffness
modulation up to 4.7 N/mm and mass of the wearable parts of just 21 g. Through
systematic characterization, we demonstrate decoupled control of size and
stiffness properties via dual-chamber pressure regulation. Human perception
studies with 10 participants reveal that users can distinguish nine discrete
states across three size categories and three stiffness levels with 89.4%
accuracy and 6.7 s average response time. We further demonstrate extended
architectures that combine AFPAs with complementary pneumatic structures to
enable shape or geometry morphing with concurrent stiffness control. Our
results establish antagonistic pneumatic principle as a pathway toward
next-generation haptic interfaces, capable of multi-dimensiona rendering
properties within practical wearable constraints.

Abstract: Autonomous regolith excavation is a cornerstone of in-situ resource
utilization for a sustained human presence beyond Earth. However, this task is
fundamentally hindered by the complex interaction dynamics of granular media
and the operational need for robots to use diverse tools. To address these
challenges, this work introduces a framework where a model-based reinforcement
learning agent learns within a parallelized simulation. This environment
leverages high-fidelity particle physics and procedural generation to create a
vast distribution of both lunar terrains and excavation tool geometries. To
master this diversity, the agent learns an adaptive interaction strategy by
dynamically modulating its own stiffness and damping at each control step
through operational space control. Our experiments demonstrate that training
with a procedural distribution of tools is critical for generalization and
enables the development of sophisticated tool-aware behavior. Furthermore, we
show that augmenting the agent with visual feedback significantly improves task
success. These results represent a validated methodology for developing the
robust and versatile autonomous systems required for the foundational tasks of
future space missions.

Result: 在模拟中AGP比WA*、PSO和RRT计算更短路径、更快速度，从2D扩展到3D保持速度不变，平均规划时间40ms每帧，兼容25fps形象采集和实时闭环控制

Conclusion: 该框架可靠地避免移动障碍物并到达目标，推进了血管环境中微米机器人自主导航和目标药物递送的发展

Abstract: Autonomous microrobots in blood vessels could enable minimally invasive
therapies, but navigation is challenged by dense, moving obstacles. We propose
a real-time path planning framework that couples an analytic geometry global
planner (AGP) with two reactive local escape controllers, one based on rules
and one based on reinforcement learning, to handle sudden moving obstacles.
Using real-time imaging, the system estimates the positions of the microrobot,
obstacles, and targets and computes collision-free motions. In simulation, AGP
yields shorter paths and faster planning than weighted A* (WA*), particle swarm
optimization (PSO), and rapidly exploring random trees (RRT), while maintaining
feasibility and determinism. We extend AGP from 2D to 3D without loss of speed.
In both simulations and experiments, the combined global planner and local
controllers reliably avoid moving obstacles and reach targets. The average
planning time is 40 ms per frame, compatible with 25 fps image acquisition and
real-time closed-loop control. These results advance autonomous microrobot
navigation and targeted drug delivery in vascular environments.

Abstract: We present a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based locomotion system for Cosmo, a
custom-built humanoid robot designed for entertainment applications. Unlike
traditional humanoids, entertainment robots present unique challenges due to
aesthetic-driven design choices. Cosmo embodies these with a disproportionately
large head (16% of total mass), limited sensing, and protective shells that
considerably restrict movement. To address these challenges, we apply
Adversarial Motion Priors (AMP) to enable the robot to learn natural-looking
movements while maintaining physical stability. We develop tailored domain
randomization techniques and specialized reward structures to ensure safe
sim-to-real, protecting valuable hardware components during deployment. Our
experiments demonstrate that AMP generates stable standing and walking
behaviors despite Cosmo's extreme mass distribution and movement constraints.
These results establish a promising direction for robots that balance aesthetic
appeal with functional performance, suggesting that learning-based methods can
effectively adapt to aesthetic-driven design constraints.

Abstract: Detecting and localizing glass in 3D environments poses significant
challenges for visual perception systems, as the optical properties of glass
often hinder conventional sensors from accurately distinguishing glass
surfaces. The lack of real-world datasets focused on glass objects further
impedes progress in this field. To address this issue, we introduce a new

annotations, collected from distinct real-world scenarios. On the basis of this
dataset, we propose MonoGlass3D, a novel approach tailored for monocular 3D
glass detection across diverse environments. To overcome the challenges posed
by the ambiguous appearance and context diversity of glass, we propose an
adaptive feature fusion module that empowers the network to effectively capture
contextual information in varying conditions. Additionally, to exploit the
distinct planar geometry of glass surfaces, we present a plane regression
pipeline, which enables seamless integration of geometric properties within our
framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches in both glass segmentation and monocular glass
depth estimation. Our results highlight the advantages of combining geometric
and contextual cues for transparent surface understanding.

Abstract: Telepresence robots enable users to interact with remote environments, but
efficient and intuitive navigation remains a challenge. In this work, we
developed and evaluated a shared control method, in which the robot navigates
autonomously while allowing users to affect the path generation to better suit
their needs. We compared this with control switching, where users toggle
between direct and automated control. We hypothesized that shared control would
maintain efficiency comparable to control switching while potentially reducing
user workload. The results of two consecutive user studies (each with final
sample of n=20) showed that shared control does not degrade navigation
efficiency, but did not show a significant reduction in task load compared to
control switching. Further research is needed to explore the underlying factors
that influence user preference and performance in these control systems.

Conclusion: A-star PRM在路径质量、稳定性和计算效率方面具有综合优势，特别适用于狭窄通道和动态障碍物场景。

Abstract: Robot path planning is a fundamental challenge in enhancing the environmental
adaptability of autonomous navigation systems. This paper presents a hybrid
path planning algorithm, A-star PRM, which incorporates dynamic weights. By
embedding the Manhattan distance heuristic of the A-star algorithm into the
random sampling process of PRM, the algorithm achieves a balanced optimization
of path quality and computational efficiency. The approach uses a hierarchical
sampling strategy and a dynamic connection mechanism, greatly improving
adaptability to complex obstacle distributions. Experiments show that under a
baseline configuration with one thousand sampled vertices, the path length of
A-star PRM is 1073.23 plus or minus 14.8 meters and is 42.3 percent shorter
than that of PRM with p value less than 0.01. With high-density sampling using
three thousand vertices, the path length is reduced by 0.94 percent, 1036.61
meters compared with 1046.42 meters, while the increase in computational time
is cut to about one tenth of the PRM increase, 71 percent compared with 785

Abstract: LiDAR-Inertial Odometry (LIO) is a foundational technique for autonomous

challenging due to computational and memory limitations. We propose Super-LIO,
a robust LIO system that demands both high performance and accuracy, ideal for
applications such as aerial robots and mobile autonomous systems. At the core
of Super-LIO is a compact octo-voxel-based map structure, termed OctVox, that
limits each voxel to eight fused subvoxels, enabling strict point density
control and incremental denoising during map updates. This design enables a
simple yet efficient and accurate map structure, which can be easily integrated
into existing LIO frameworks. Additionally, Super-LIO designs a
heuristic-guided KNN strategy (HKNN) that accelerates the correspondence search
by leveraging spatial locality, further reducing runtime overhead. We evaluated
the proposed system using four publicly available datasets and several
self-collected datasets, totaling more than 30 sequences. Extensive testing on
both X86 and ARM platforms confirms that Super-LIO offers superior efficiency
and robustness, while maintaining competitive accuracy. Super-LIO processes
each frame approximately 73% faster than SOTA, while consuming less CPU
resources. The system is fully open-source and plug-and-play compatible with a
wide range of LiDAR sensors and platforms. The implementation is available at:

Abstract: Game-based interactive driving simulations have emerged as versatile
platforms for advancing decision-making algorithms in road transport mobility.
While these environments offer safe, scalable, and engaging settings for
testing driving strategies, ensuring both realism and robust performance amid
dynamic and diverse scenarios remains a significant challenge. Recently, the
integration of game-based techniques with advanced learning frameworks has
enabled the development of adaptive decision-making models that effectively
manage the complexities inherent in varied driving conditions. These models
outperform traditional simulation methods, especially when addressing
scenario-specific challenges, ranging from obstacle avoidance on highways and
precise maneuvering during on-ramp merging to navigation in roundabouts,
unsignalized intersections, and even the high-speed demands of autonomous
racing. Despite numerous innovations in game-based interactive driving, a
systematic review comparing these approaches across different scenarios is
still missing. This survey provides a comprehensive evaluation of game-based
interactive driving methods by summarizing recent advancements and inherent
roadway features in each scenario. Furthermore, the reviewed algorithms are
critically assessed based on their adaptation of the standard game model and an

Abstract: The bioinspired event camera, distinguished by its exceptional temporal
resolution, high dynamic range, and low power consumption, has been extensively
studied in recent years for motion estimation, robotic perception, and object
detection. In ego-motion estimation, the visual-inertial setup is commonly
adopted due to complementary characteristics between sensors (e.g., scale
perception and low drift). For optimal event-based visual-inertial fusion,
accurate spatiotemporal (extrinsic and temporal) calibration is required. In
this work, we present eKalibr-Inertial, an accurate spatiotemporal calibrator
for event-based visual-inertial systems, utilizing the widely used circle grid
board. Building upon the grid pattern recognition and tracking methods in
eKalibr and eKalibr-Stereo, the proposed method starts with a rigorous and
efficient initialization, where all parameters in the estimator would be
accurately recovered. Subsequently, a continuous-time-based batch optimization
is conducted to refine the initialized parameters toward better states. The
results of extensive real-world experiments show that eKalibr-Inertial can
achieve accurate event-based visual-inertial spatiotemporal calibration. The
implementation of eKalibr-Inertial is open-sourced at

Abstract: With the rapid development of the warehousing and logistics industries, the
packing of goods has gradually attracted the attention of academia and
industry. The packing of footwear products is a typical representative
paired-item packing task involving irregular shapes and deformable objects.
Although studies on shoe packing have been conducted, different initial states
due to the irregular shapes of shoes and standard packing placement poses have
not been considered. This study proposes a robotic manipulation framework,
including a perception module, reorientation planners, and a packing planner,
that can complete the packing of pairs of shoes in any initial state. First, to
adapt to the large intraclass variations due to the state, shape, and
deformation of the shoe, we propose a vision module based on semantic
keypoints, which can also infer more information such as size, state, pose, and
manipulation points by combining geometric features. Subsequently, we not only
proposed primitive-based reorientation methods for different states of a single
deformable shoe but also proposed a fast reorientation method for the top state
using box edge contact and gravity, which further improved the efficiency of
reorientation. Finally, based on the perception module and reorientation
methods, we propose a task planner for shoe pair packing in any initial state
to provide an optimal packing strategy. Real-world experiments were conducted
to verify the robustness of the reorientation methods and the effectiveness of
the packing strategy for various types of shoes. In this study, we highlight
the potential of semantic keypoint representation methods, introduce new
perspectives on the reorientation of 3D deformable objects and multi-object
manipulation, and provide a reference for paired object packing.

Method: 提出基线算法使用Z*算法迭代访问每个拾取点，然后设计并发PCPD搜索算法，通过Payload-Constrained Path Database管理多个Z*搜索，减少分支因子。

Conclusion: PCPD方法有效解决了OMEPP问题，在保证解质量的同时显著提高了计算效率，为移动机器人的实际应用提供了实用的能量高效路径规划解决方案。

Abstract: Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs) operate on battery power, making energy
efficiency a critical consideration, particularly in outdoor environments where
terrain variations affect energy consumption. While prior research has
primarily focused on computing energy-efficient paths from a source to a
destination, these approaches often overlook practical scenarios where a robot
needs to pick up an object en route - an action that can significantly impact
energy consumption due to changes in payload. This paper introduces the
Object-Pickup Minimum Energy Path Problem (OMEPP), which addresses
energy-efficient route planning for AMRs required to pick up an object from one
of many possible locations and deliver it to a destination. To address OMEPP,
we first introduce a baseline algorithm that employs the Z star algorithm, a
variant of A star tailored for energy-efficient routing, to iteratively visit
each pickup point. While this approach guarantees optimality, it suffers from
high computational cost due to repeated searches at each pickup location. To
mitigate this inefficiency, we propose a concurrent PCPD search that manages
multiple Z star searches simultaneously across all pickup points. Central to
our solution is the Payload-Constrained Path Database (PCPD), an extension of
the Compressed Path Database (CPD) that incorporates payload constraints. We
demonstrate that PCPD significantly reduces branching factors during search,
improving overall performance. Although the concurrent PCPD search may produce
slightly suboptimal solutions, extensive experiments on real-world datasets
show it achieves near-optimal performance while being one to two orders of
magnitude faster than the baseline algorithm.

Motivation: 现有路径规划方法通常假设单一运动模式，无法充分利用四轮独立轮轮系统的多模态运动能力

Method: 构建4维状态空间（空间坐标+运动模式），设计多模态Reeds-Shepp曲线，改进启发函数考虑模式切换成本，采用智能模式选择的终端连接策略

Result: 在复杂环境中显著提升了四轮独立轮轮机器人的规划性能

Conclusion: 该方法能够在单条路径中无缝集成多种运动模态，大大提高了机器人在复杂环境中的灵活性和适应性

Abstract: Four-wheel independent steering (4WIS) systems provide mobile robots with a
rich set of motion modes, such as Ackermann steering, lateral steering, and
parallel movement, offering superior maneuverability in constrained
environments. However, existing path planning methods generally assume a single
kinematic model and thus fail to fully exploit the multi-modal capabilities of
4WIS platforms. To address this limitation, we propose an extended Hybrid A*
framework that operates in a four-dimensional state space incorporating both
spatial states and motion modes. Within this framework, we design multi-modal
Reeds-Shepp curves tailored to the distinct kinematic constraints of each
motion mode, develop an enhanced heuristic function that accounts for
mode-switching costs, and introduce a terminal connection strategy with
intelligent mode selection to ensure smooth transitions between different
steering patterns. The proposed planner enables seamless integration of
multiple motion modalities within a single path, significantly improving
flexibility and adaptability in complex environments. Results demonstrate
significantly improved planning performance for 4WIS robots in complex
environments.

Method: 设计了一种混合TDMA/CSMA协议，结合TDMA的定时器调度和CSMA的适应性，采用子微秒PTP基准时钟同步、三会话超帧架构造和动态TDMA分配机制

Result: 在实时SDR平台和ROS模拟中，该协议将失期错误减少93%，高速轨迹核对误差降低90%，同时非关键流量吞吐量保持在±2%以内

Conclusion: 该混合TDMA/CSMA协议有效解决了机器人通信中的实时性挑战，在保持IEEE 802.11兼容性的同时提供了确定性延迟保障，为工业制造、医疗健康等领域的实时控制应用提供了可靠的通信基础

Abstract: Recent progress in robotics has underscored the demand for real-time control
in applications such as manufacturing, healthcare, and autonomous systems,
where the timely delivery of mission-critical commands under heterogeneous
robotic traffic is paramount for operational efficacy and safety. In these
scenarios, mission-critical traffic follows a strict deadline-constrained
communication pattern: commands must arrive within defined QoS deadlines,
otherwise late arrivals can degrade performance or destabilize control loops.In
this work, we demonstrate on a real-time SDR platform that CSMA, widely adopted
in robotic communications,suffers severe degradation under high robot traffic
loads, with contention-induced collisions and delays disrupting the on-time
arrival of mission-critical packets. To address this problem, we propose an
IEEE 802.11-compatible hybrid TDMA/CSMA protocol that combines TDMA's
deterministic slot scheduling with CSMA's adaptability for heterogeneous robot
traffic.The protocol achieves collision-free, low-latency mission-critical
command delivery and IEEE 802.11 compatibility through the synergistic
integration of sub-microsecond PTP-based slot synchronization-essential for
establishing precise timing for TDMA, a three-session superframe with dynamic
TDMA allocation for structured and adaptable traffic management,and beacon-NAV
protection to preemptively secure these critical communication sessions from
interference. Emulation experiments on real-time SDR testbed and Robot
Operating System (ROS) simulation show that the proposed protocol reduces
missed-deadline errors by 93% compared to the CSMA baseline. In high-speed
robot path-tracking ROS simulations, the protocol lowers Root Mean Square (RMS)
trajectory error by up to 90% compared with a CSMA baseline, all while
maintaining throughput for non-critical traffic within +-2%.

Abstract: Recent 3D generative models, which are capable of generating full object
shapes from just a few images, now open up new opportunities in robotics. In
this work, we show that 3D generative models can be used to augment a dataset
from a single real-world demonstration, after which an omnidirectional policy
can be learned within this imagined dataset. We found that this enables a robot
to perform a task when initialised from states very far from those observed
during the demonstration, including starting from the opposite side of the
object relative to the real-world demonstration, significantly reducing the
number of demonstrations required for policy learning. Through several
real-world experiments across tasks such as grasping objects, opening a drawer,
and placing trash into a bin, we study these omnidirectional policies by
investigating the effect of various design choices on policy behaviour, and we
show superior performance to recent baselines which use alternative methods for
data augmentation.

Conclusion: Grasp-MPC通过结合学习价值函数和MPC框架，实现了在杂乱环境中对新物体的稳健和反应式抓取，显著提高了抓取性能

Abstract: Grasping of diverse objects in unstructured environments remains a
significant challenge. Open-loop grasping methods, effective in controlled
settings, struggle in cluttered environments. Grasp prediction errors and
object pose changes during grasping are the main causes of failure. In
contrast, closed-loop methods address these challenges in simplified settings
(e.g., single object on a table) on a limited set of objects, with no path to
generalization. We propose Grasp-MPC, a closed-loop 6-DoF vision-based grasping
policy designed for robust and reactive grasping of novel objects in cluttered
environments. Grasp-MPC incorporates a value function, trained on visual
observations from a large-scale synthetic dataset of 2 million grasp
trajectories that include successful and failed attempts. We deploy this
learned value function in an MPC framework in combination with other cost terms
that encourage collision avoidance and smooth execution. We evaluate Grasp-MPC
on FetchBench and real-world settings across diverse environments. Grasp-MPC
improves grasp success rates by up to 32.6% in simulation and 33.3% in
real-world noisy conditions, outperforming open-loop, diffusion policy,
transformer policy, and IQL approaches. Videos and more at

Result: 在3D物体间功能关系学习和机器人操作实验中，O³Afford在准确性和泛化能力方面显著优于现有基线方法

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了数据有限条件下的物体间功能关系学习问题，为机器人操作提供了更好的感知-动作链接

Abstract: Grounding object affordance is fundamental to robotic manipulation as it
establishes the critical link between perception and action among interacting
objects. However, prior works predominantly focus on predicting single-object
affordance, overlooking the fact that most real-world interactions involve
relationships between pairs of objects. In this work, we address the challenge
of object-to-object affordance grounding under limited data contraints.
Inspired by recent advances in few-shot learning with 2D vision foundation
models, we propose a novel one-shot 3D object-to-object affordance learning
approach for robotic manipulation. Semantic features from vision foundation
models combined with point cloud representation for geometric understanding
enable our one-shot learning pipeline to generalize effectively to novel
objects and categories. We further integrate our 3D affordance representation
with large language models (LLMs) for robotics manipulation, significantly
enhancing LLMs' capability to comprehend and reason about object interactions
when generating task-specific constraint functions. Our experiments on 3D
object-to-object affordance grounding and robotic manipulation demonstrate that
our O$^3$Afford significantly outperforms existing baselines in terms of both
accuracy and generalization capability.

Conclusion: DCReg通过系统性的病态问题处理框架，为LiDAR点云配准在退化环境中的鲁棒性和效率提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: LiDAR point cloud registration is fundamental to robotic perception and
navigation. However, in geometrically degenerate or narrow environments,
registration problems become ill-conditioned, leading to unstable solutions and
degraded accuracy. While existing approaches attempt to handle these issues,
they fail to address the core challenge: accurately detection, interpret, and
resolve this ill-conditioning, leading to missed detections or corrupted
solutions. In this study, we introduce DCReg, a principled framework that
systematically addresses the ill-conditioned registration problems through
three integrated innovations. First, DCReg achieves reliable ill-conditioning
detection by employing a Schur complement decomposition to the hessian matrix.
This technique decouples the registration problem into clean rotational and
translational subspaces, eliminating coupling effects that mask degeneracy
patterns in conventional analyses. Second, within these cleanly subspaces, we
develop quantitative characterization techniques that establish explicit
mappings between mathematical eigenspaces and physical motion directions,
providing actionable insights about which specific motions lack constraints.
Finally, leveraging this clean subspace, we design a targeted mitigation
strategy: a novel preconditioner that selectively stabilizes only the
identified ill-conditioned directions while preserving all well-constrained
information in observable space. This enables efficient and robust optimization
via the Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient method with a single physical
interpretable parameter. Extensive experiments demonstrate DCReg achieves at
least 20% - 50% improvement in localization accuracy and 5-100 times speedup
over state-of-the-art methods across diverse environments. Our implementation
will be available at https://github.com/JokerJohn/DCReg.

Abstract: Traditional RL-based locomotion controllers often suffer from low data
efficiency, requiring extensive interaction to achieve robust performance. We
present a model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) framework that improves
sample efficiency for quadrupedal locomotion by appending synthetic data to the
end of standard rollouts in PPO-based controllers, following the Dyna-Style
paradigm. A predictive model, trained alongside the policy, generates
short-horizon synthetic transitions that are gradually integrated using a
scheduling strategy based on the policy update iterations. Through an ablation
study, we identified a strong correlation between sample efficiency and rollout
length, which guided the design of our experiments. We validated our approach
in simulation on the Unitree Go1 robot and showed that replacing part of the
simulated steps with synthetic ones not only mimics extended rollouts but also
improves policy return and reduces variance. Finally, we demonstrate that this
improvement transfers to the ability to track a wide range of locomotion
commands using fewer simulated steps.

Abstract: Legged robots must achieve both robust locomotion and energy efficiency to be
practical in real-world environments. Yet controllers trained in simulation
often fail to transfer reliably, and most existing approaches neglect
actuator-specific energy losses or depend on complex, hand-tuned reward
formulations. We propose a framework that integrates sim-to-real reinforcement
learning with a physics-grounded energy model for permanent magnet synchronous
motors. The framework requires a minimal parameter set to capture the
simulation-to-reality gap and employs a compact four-term reward with a
first-principle-based energetic loss formulation that balances electrical and
mechanical dissipation. We evaluate and validate the approach through a
bottom-up dynamic parameter identification study, spanning actuators,
full-robot in-air trajectories and on-ground locomotion. The framework is
tested on three primary platforms and deployed on ten additional robots,
demonstrating reliable policy transfer without randomization of dynamic
parameters. Our method improves energetic efficiency over state-of-the-art
methods, achieving a 32 percent reduction in the full Cost of Transport of
ANYmal (value 1.27). All code, models, and datasets will be released.

Conclusion: ERPF方法为复杂交互驾驶环境提供了轻量级、自适应且鲁棒的解决方案，克服了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: In recent years, ensuring safety, efficiency, and comfort in interactive
autonomous driving has become a critical challenge. Traditional model-based
techniques, such as game-theoretic methods and robust control, are often overly
conservative or computationally intensive. Conversely, learning-based
approaches typically require extensive training data and frequently exhibit
limited interpretability and generalizability. Simpler strategies, such as Risk
Potential Fields (RPF), provide lightweight alternatives with minimal data
demands but are inherently static and struggle to adapt effectively to dynamic
traffic conditions. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Evolutionary
Risk Potential Field (ERPF), a novel approach that dynamically updates risk
assessments in dynamical scenarios based on historical obstacle proximity data.
We introduce a Risk-Ellipse construct that combines longitudinal reach and
lateral uncertainty into a unified spatial temporal collision envelope.
Additionally, we define an adaptive Evolution Factor metric, computed through
sigmoid normalization of Time to Collision (TTC) and Time-Window-of-Hazard
(TWH), which dynamically adjusts the dimensions of the ellipse axes in real
time. This adaptive risk metric is integrated seamlessly into a Model
Predictive Control (MPC) framework, enabling autonomous vehicles to proactively
address complex interactive driving scenarios in terms of uncertain driving of
surrounding vehicles. Comprehensive comparative experiments demonstrate that
our ERPF-MPC approach consistently achieves smoother trajectories, higher
average speeds, and collision-free navigation, offering a robust and adaptive
solution suitable for complex interactive driving environments.

Conclusion: BAN-MPC是一种有效的嵌入式MPC替代方案，无需重新训练即可适应参数变化，显著降低了离线计算成本。

Abstract: While Model Predictive Control (MPC) enforces safety via constraints, its
real-time execution can exceed embedded compute budgets. We propose a
Barrier-integrated Adaptive Neural Model Predictive Control (BAN-MPC) framework
that synergizes neural networks' fast computation with MPC's
constraint-handling capability. To ensure strict safety, we replace traditional
Euclidean distance with Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) for collision
avoidance. We integrate an offline-learned neural value function into the
optimization objective of a Short-horizon MPC, substantially reducing online
computational complexity. Additionally, we use a second neural network to learn
the sensitivity of the value function to system parameters, and adaptively
adjust the neural value function based on this neural sensitivity when model
parameters change, eliminating the need for retraining and reducing offline
computation costs. The hardware in-the-loop (HIL) experiments on Jetson Nano
show that BAN-MPC solves 200 times faster than traditional MPC, enabling
collision-free navigation with control error below 5\% under model parameter
variations within 15\%, making it an effective embedded MPC alternative.

Abstract: Achieving efficient remote teleoperation is particularly challenging in
unknown environments, as the teleoperator must rapidly build an understanding
of the site's layout. Online 3D mapping is a proven strategy to tackle this
challenge, as it enables the teleoperator to progressively explore the site
from multiple perspectives. However, traditional online map-based teleoperation
systems struggle to generate visually accurate 3D maps in real-time due to the
high computational cost involved, leading to poor teleoperation performances.
In this work, we propose a solution to improve teleoperation efficiency in
unknown environments. Our approach proposes a novel, modular and efficient
GPU-based integration between recent advancement in gaussian splatting SLAM and
existing online map-based teleoperation systems. We compare the proposed
solution against state-of-the-art teleoperation systems and validate its
performances through real-world experiments using an aerial vehicle. The
results show significant improvements in decision-making speed and more
accurate interaction with the environment, leading to greater teleoperation
efficiency. In doing so, our system enhances remote teleoperation by seamlessly
integrating photorealistic mapping generation with real-time performances,
enabling effective teleoperation in unfamiliar environments.

Abstract: Autonomous manipulation of granular media, such as sand, is crucial for
applications in construction, excavation, and additive manufacturing. However,
shaping granular materials presents unique challenges due to their
high-dimensional configuration space and complex dynamics, where traditional
rule-based approaches struggle without extensive engineering efforts.
Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising alternative by enabling agents
to learn adaptive manipulation strategies through trial and error. In this
work, we present an RL framework that enables a robotic arm with a cubic
end-effector and a stereo camera to shape granular media into desired target
structures. We show the importance of compact observations and concise reward
formulations for the large configuration space, validating our design choices
with an ablation study. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed approach for the training of visual policies that manipulate granular
media including their real-world deployment, outperforming two baseline
approaches.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 通过事件驱动通信机制改进多机器人任务分配算法，在保持性能的同时大幅减少信息传输量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多机器人任务分配中，传统的CBBA算法需要连续通信，容易造成网络塞塞和数据包丢失，影响算法性能

Method: 提出事件驱动通信机制（ED-CBBA），在保持CBBA收敛性和性能上界的前提下，减少不必要的通信

Result: 理论证明解决方案质量与CBBA相同，模拟实验显示可将消息传输量减少至52%

Conclusion: ED-CBBA算法有效解决了多机器人系统中的通信挑战，在保持任务分配性能的同时大幅提升了通信效率

Abstract: In various scenarios such as multi-drone surveillance and search-and-rescue
operations, deploying multiple robots is essential to accomplish multiple tasks
at once. Due to the limited communication range of these vehicles, a
decentralised task allocation algorithm is crucial for effective task
distribution among robots. The consensus-based bundle algorithm (CBBA) has been
promising for multi-robot operation, offering theoretical guarantees. However,
CBBA demands continuous communication, leading to potential congestion and
packet loss that can hinder performance. In this study, we introduce an
event-driven communication mechanism designed to address these communication
challenges while maintaining the convergence and performance bounds of CBBA. We
demonstrate theoretically that the solution quality matches that of CBBA and
validate the approach with Monte-Carlo simulations across varying targets,
agents, and bundles. Results indicate that the proposed algorithm (ED-CBBA) can
reduce message transmissions by up to 52%.

TL;DR: 一种多用户VR同地化框架，通过结合动作捕捉系统和SLAM内部追踪技术，实现了低延迟、高帧率的多用户VR共享环境同步


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有多用户VR同地化方案中存在的延迟、抖动和时间偏移问题，提供更自然、舒适和稳定的多用户交互体验

Method: 结合动作捕捉系统和SLAM基于内部追踪技术，在保持本地HMD SLAM追踪响应性的同时，支持需要时与外部源重新对齐，并支持跨设备实时姿态共享

Result: 评估结果显示该框架达到了自然多用户交互所需的空间精度，同时在舒适性、可扩展性和稳健性方面都超过了现有的同地VR解决方案

Conclusion: 该框架成功地结合了本地SLAM追踪的响应性和外部对齐的灵活性，为多用户VR同地化提供了一种更优科学的方案，能够确保用户间的一致空间对齐和互动体验

Abstract: We introduce a multi-user VR co-location framework that synchronizes users
within a shared virtual environment aligned to physical space. Our approach
combines a motion capture system with SLAM-based inside-out tracking to deliver
smooth, high-framerate, low-latency performance. Previous methods either rely
on continuous external tracking, which introduces latency and jitter, or on
one-time calibration, which cannot correct drift over time. In contrast, our
approach combines the responsiveness of local HMD SLAM tracking with the
flexibility to realign to an external source when needed. It also supports
real-time pose sharing across devices, ensuring consistent spatial alignment
and engagement between users. Our evaluation demonstrates that our framework
achieves the spatial accuracy required for natural multi-user interaction while
offering improved comfort, scalability, and robustness over existing co-located
VR solutions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人导航需要精确的里程计，现有方法通常依赖传感器特定建模，难以在不同传感器类型和目标域中保持鲁棒性。

Method: 采用简化的IMU运动模型进行积分，直接在扫描到地图框架中进行激光雷达扫描配准，并引入新颖的正则化约束。

Result: 在多个数据集上进行了广泛实验，覆盖各种常用机器人传感器和平台，证明该方法在所有场景中使用相同配置都能稳定工作。

Conclusion: 该方法具有出色的鲁棒性和通用性，已开源实现供社区进一步发展和应用。

Abstract: Accurate odometry is a critical component in a robotic navigation stack, and
subsequent modules such as planning and control often rely on an estimate of
the robot's motion. Sensor-based odometry approaches should be robust across
sensor types and deployable in different target domains, from solid-state
LiDARs mounted on cars in urban-driving scenarios to spinning LiDARs on
handheld packages used in unstructured natural environments. In this paper, we
propose a robust LiDAR-inertial odometry system that does not rely on
sensor-specific modeling. Sensor fusion techniques for LiDAR and inertial
measurement unit (IMU) data typically integrate IMU data iteratively in a
Kalman filter or use pre-integration in a factor graph framework, combined with
LiDAR scan matching often exploiting some form of feature extraction. We
propose an alternative strategy that only requires a simplified motion model
for IMU integration and directly registers LiDAR scans in a scan-to-map
approach. Our approach allows us to impose a novel regularization on the LiDAR
registration, improving the overall odometry performance. We detail extensive
experiments on a number of datasets covering a wide array of commonly used
robotic sensors and platforms. We show that our approach works with the exact
same configuration in all these scenarios, demonstrating its robustness. We
have open-sourced our implementation so that the community can build further on
our work and use it in their navigation stacks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业环境中协作机器人日益普及，需要可靠的安全系统，但缺乏高质量的人机交互数据集（包括危险事件）阻碍了发展。

Method: 提供多模态数据集，结合3D LiDAR点云、人体关键点和机器人关节状态，捕捉人机协作的完整空间和动态上下文，涵盖6种HRI场景的安全和危险版本。

Result: 数据集包含4431个以10Hz记录的标记点云，为传统和AI驱动的风险监测算法提供了丰富的训练和基准测试资源。

Conclusion: LiHRA通过高分辨率LiDAR数据、精确人体追踪、机器人状态数据和真实碰撞事件，为实时风险监测和自适应安全策略研究提供了重要基础。

Abstract: We present LiHRA, a novel dataset designed to facilitate the development of
automated, learning-based, or classical risk monitoring (RM) methods for
Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) scenarios. The growing prevalence of
collaborative robots in industrial environments has increased the need for
reliable safety systems. However, the lack of high-quality datasets that
capture realistic human-robot interactions, including potentially dangerous
events, slows development. LiHRA addresses this challenge by providing a
comprehensive, multi-modal dataset combining 3D LiDAR point clouds, human body
keypoints, and robot joint states, capturing the complete spatial and dynamic
context of human-robot collaboration. This combination of modalities allows for
precise tracking of human movement, robot actions, and environmental
conditions, enabling accurate RM during collaborative tasks. The LiHRA dataset
covers six representative HRI scenarios involving collaborative and coexistent
tasks, object handovers, and surface polishing, with safe and hazardous
versions of each scenario. In total, the data set includes 4,431 labeled point
clouds recorded at 10 Hz, providing a rich resource for training and
benchmarking classical and AI-driven RM algorithms. Finally, to demonstrate
LiHRA's utility, we introduce an RM method that quantifies the risk level in
each scenario over time. This method leverages contextual information,
including robot states and the dynamic model of the robot. With its combination
of high-resolution LiDAR data, precise human tracking, robot state data, and
realistic collision events, LiHRA offers an essential foundation for future
research into real-time RM and adaptive safety strategies in human-robot
workspaces.

Conclusion: T-araVLN在农业视觉语言导航领域达到了最先进的性能，有效解决了复杂指令理解问题

Abstract: Agricultural robotic agents have been becoming powerful helpers in a wide
range of agricultural tasks, nevertheless, still heavily rely on manual
operation or untransportable railway for movement. The AgriVLN method and the
A2A benchmark pioneeringly extend Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) to the
agricultural domain, enabling agents navigate to the target position following
the natural language instructions. AgriVLN effectively understands the simple
instructions, however, often misunderstands the complicated instructions. To
bridge this gap, we propose the method of Translator for Agricultural Robotic
Agents on Vision-and-Language Navigation (T-araVLN), in which the Instruction
Translator module translates the original instruction to be both refined and
precise. Being evaluated on the A2A benchmark, our T-araVLN effectively
improves SR from 0.47 to 0.63 and reduces NE from 2.91m to 2.28m, demonstrating
the state-of-the-art performance in the agricultural domain. Code:

Conclusion: 该方法为动态农业环境中的自主覆盖控制提供了有效解决方案，通过UAV-UGV协同和动态图模型实现了更高效的工作效果

Abstract: This paper presents an adaptive coverage control method for a fleet of
off-road and Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) operating in dynamic
(time-varying) agricultural environments. Traditional coverage control
approaches often assume static conditions, making them unsuitable for
real-world farming scenarios where obstacles, such as moving machinery and
uneven terrains, create continuous challenges. To address this, we propose a
real-time path planning framework that integrates Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
(UAVs) for obstacle detection and terrain assessment, allowing UGVs to
dynamically adjust their coverage paths. The environment is modeled as a
weighted directed graph, where the edge weights are continuously updated based
on the UAV observations to reflect obstacle motion and terrain variations. The
proposed approach incorporates Voronoi-based partitioning, adaptive edge weight
assignment, and cost-based path optimization to enhance navigation efficiency.
Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in
improving path planning, reducing traversal costs, and maintaining robust
coverage in the presence of dynamic obstacles and muddy terrains.

Abstract: Deploying self-navigating surface vessels in inland waterways offers a
sustainable alternative to reduce road traffic congestion and emissions.
However, navigating confined waterways presents unique challenges, including
narrow channels, higher traffic density, and hydrodynamic disturbances.
Existing methods for autonomous vessel navigation often lack the robustness or
precision required for such environments. This paper presents a new motion
planning approach for Automated Surface Vessels (ASVs) using Robust Model
Predictive Control (RMPC) combined with Control Barrier Functions (CBFs). By
incorporating channel borders and obstacles as safety constraints within the
control design framework, the proposed method ensures both collision avoidance
and robust navigation on complex waterways. Simulation results demonstrate the
efficacy of the proposed method in safely guiding ASVs under realistic
conditions, highlighting its improved safety and adaptability compared to the
state-of-the-art.

The proposed system enables robots to perceive, interpret, report, and if

Abstract: Learning-based controllers, such as diffusion policies and vision-language
action models, often generate low-frequency or discontinuous robot state
changes. Achieving smooth reference tracking requires a low-level controller
that converts high-level targets commands into joint torques, enabling
compliant behavior during contact interactions. We present CRISP, a lightweight
C++ implementation of compliant Cartesian and joint-space controllers for the
ROS2 control standard, designed for seamless integration with high-level
learning-based policies as well as teleoperation. The controllers are
compatible with any manipulator that exposes a joint-torque interface. Through
our Python and Gymnasium interfaces, CRISP provides a unified pipeline for
recording data from hardware and simulation and deploying high-level
learning-based policies seamlessly, facilitating rapid experimentation. The
system has been validated on hardware with the Franka Robotics FR3 and in
simulation with the Kuka IIWA14 and Kinova Gen3. Designed for rapid
integration, flexible deployment, and real-time performance, our implementation
provides a unified pipeline for data collection and policy execution, lowering

Abstract: Micro Autonomous Surface Vehicles (MicroASVs) offer significant potential for
operations in confined or shallow waters and swarm robotics applications.
However, achieving precise and robust control at such small scales remains
highly challenging, mainly due to the complexity of modeling nonlinear
hydrodynamic forces and the increased sensitivity to self-motion effects and
environmental disturbances, including waves and boundary effects in confined
spaces. This paper presents a physics-driven dynamics model for an
over-actuated MicroASV and introduces a data-driven optimal control framework
that leverages a weak formulation-based online model learning method. Our
approach continuously refines the physics-driven model in real time, enabling
adaptive control that adjusts to changing system parameters. Simulation results
demonstrate that the proposed method substantially enhances trajectory tracking
accuracy and robustness, even under unknown payloads and external disturbances.
These findings highlight the potential of data-driven online learning-based
optimal control to improve MicroASV performance, paving the way for more
reliable and precise autonomous surface vehicle operations.

Abstract: The rapid progress of auto-regressive vision-language models (VLMs) has
inspired growing interest in vision-language-action models (VLA) for robotic
manipulation. Recently, masked diffusion models, a paradigm distinct from
autoregressive models, have begun to demonstrate competitive performance in
text generation and multimodal applications, leading to the development of a
series of diffusion-based VLMs (d-VLMs). However, leveraging such models for
robot policy learning remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present
LLaDA-VLA, the first Vision-Language-Diffusion-Action model built upon
pretrained d-VLMs for robotic manipulation. To effectively adapt d-VLMs to
robotic domain, we introduce two key designs: (1) a localized special-token
classification strategy that replaces full-vocabulary classification with
special action token classification, reducing adaptation difficulty; (2) a
hierarchical action-structured decoding strategy that decodes action sequences
hierarchically considering the dependencies within and across actions.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that LLaDA-VLA significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art VLAs on both simulation and real-world robots.

Abstract: Executing language-conditioned tasks in dynamic visual environments remains a
central challenge in embodied AI. Existing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models
predominantly adopt reactive state-to-action mappings, often leading to
short-sighted behaviors and poor robustness in dynamic scenes. In this paper,
we introduce F1, a pretrained VLA framework which integrates the visual
foresight generation into decision-making pipeline. F1 adopts a
Mixture-of-Transformer architecture with dedicated modules for perception,
foresight generation, and control, thereby bridging understanding, generation,
and actions. At its core, F1 employs a next-scale prediction mechanism to
synthesize goal-conditioned visual foresight as explicit planning targets. By
forecasting plausible future visual states, F1 reformulates action generation
as a foresight-guided inverse dynamics problem, enabling actions that
implicitly achieve visual goals. To endow F1 with robust and generalizable
capabilities, we propose a three-stage training recipe on an extensive dataset
comprising over 330k trajectories across 136 diverse tasks. This training
scheme enhances modular reasoning and equips the model with transferable visual
foresight, which is critical for complex and dynamic environments. Extensive
evaluations on real-world tasks and simulation benchmarks demonstrate F1
consistently outperforms existing approaches, achieving substantial gains in
both task success rate and generalization ability.

Method: 提出Deep Reactive Policy (DRP)，核心是IMPACT Transformer神经运动策略，在千万专家轨迹上预训练，通过师生迭代微调提升静态避障，使用DCP-RMP模块增强动态避障。

Result: DRP在杂乱场景、动态障碍物和目标遮挡等挑战性任务中表现出色，在仿真和真实环境中均优于传统和神经方法，成功率高。

Conclusion: DRP通过结合预训练、微调和局部反应模块，实现了在动态部分可观测环境中的强泛化能力和高效运动生成，为机器人操作提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Generating collision-free motion in dynamic, partially observable
environments is a fundamental challenge for robotic manipulators. Classical
motion planners can compute globally optimal trajectories but require full
environment knowledge and are typically too slow for dynamic scenes. Neural
motion policies offer a promising alternative by operating in closed-loop
directly on raw sensory inputs but often struggle to generalize in complex or
dynamic settings. We propose Deep Reactive Policy (DRP), a visuo-motor neural
motion policy designed for reactive motion generation in diverse dynamic
environments, operating directly on point cloud sensory input. At its core is
IMPACT, a transformer-based neural motion policy pretrained on 10 million
generated expert trajectories across diverse simulation scenarios. We further
improve IMPACT's static obstacle avoidance through iterative student-teacher
finetuning. We additionally enhance the policy's dynamic obstacle avoidance at
inference time using DCP-RMP, a locally reactive goal-proposal module. We
evaluate DRP on challenging tasks featuring cluttered scenes, dynamic moving
obstacles, and goal obstructions. DRP achieves strong generalization,
outperforming prior classical and neural methods in success rate across both
simulated and real-world settings. Video results and code available at

Motivation: 为了解决传统方法在处理长序列时的计算效率问题，同时更好地融合视觉和本体感知信息，实现更高效的机器人运动控制。

Method: 1) 使用MLP嵌入本体感知状态，CNN处理深度图像生成紧凑token；2) 堆叠Mamba层通过选择性扫描融合token；3) 使用PPO算法在随机化环境中端到端训练策略。

Conclusion: LocoMamba框架通过选择性状态空间模型有效解决了长序列建模问题，在机器人运动控制任务中表现出优异的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: We introduce LocoMamba, a vision-driven cross-modal DRL framework built on
selective state-space models, specifically leveraging Mamba, that achieves
near-linear-time sequence modeling, effectively captures long-range
dependencies, and enables efficient training with longer sequences. First, we
embed proprioceptive states with a multilayer perceptron and patchify depth
images with a lightweight convolutional neural network, producing compact
tokens that improve state representation. Second, stacked Mamba layers fuse
these tokens via near-linear-time selective scanning, reducing latency and
memory footprint, remaining robust to token length and image resolution, and
providing an inductive bias that mitigates overfitting. Third, we train the
policy end-to-end with Proximal Policy Optimization under terrain and
appearance randomization and an obstacle-density curriculum, using a compact
state-centric reward that balances progress, smoothness, and safety. We
evaluate our method in challenging simulated environments with static and
moving obstacles as well as uneven terrain. Compared with state-of-the-art
baselines, our method achieves higher returns and success rates with fewer
collisions, exhibits stronger generalization to unseen terrains and obstacle
densities, and improves training efficiency by converging in fewer updates
under the same compute budget.

Motivation: 重新审视WSPD（well-separated pairs-decomposition）概念，旨在改进现有构造方法的大小和效率，特别是在平面加权单位距离度量方面，并探索WSPD在新应用中的潜力。

Method: 提出两种新的WSPD构造方法：1）适用于任意有限度量空间的渐近实例最优大小构造；2）针对平面加权单位距离度量的新构造，通过更简单优雅的方法实现大小改进。

Result: 1）任意有限度量空间的WSPD构造达到渐近实例最优大小；2）平面加权单位距离度量的WSPD大小界限为O(ε⁻²n log n)，比先前工作改进1/ε²倍；3）展示了WSPD在近似双射失真和曲线简化中的新应用。

Conclusion: 新的WSPD构造方法在理论性能和应用范围上都取得了显著进展，不仅改进了构造大小和效率，还拓展了WSPD在计算几何问题中的应用价值，特别是在低维空间中的近线性时间算法设计。

Abstract: We revisit the notion of WSPD (i.e., well-separated pairs-decomposition),
presenting a new construction of WSPD for any finite metric space, and show
that it is asymptotically instance-optimal in size. Next, we describe a new
WSPD construction for the weighted unit-distance metric in the plane, and show
a bound $O( \varepsilon^{-2} n \log n)$ on its size, improving by a factor of
$1/\varepsilon^2$ over previous work. The new construction is arguably simpler
and more elegant.
  We point out that using WSPD, one can approximate, in near-linear time, the
distortion of a bijection between two point sets in low dimensions. As a new
application of WSPD, we show how to shortcut a polygonal curve such that its
dilation is below a prespecified quantity. In particular, we show a near-linear
time algorithm for computing a simple subcurve for a given polygonal curve in
the plane so that the new subcurve has no self-intersection.

Motivation: 解决图绘制中边交叉数最小化的问题，既要考虑全局交叉数总量，也要关注单条边上的最大交叉数，以提升图形可读性。

Method: 使用强化学习算法，让组件学习如何根据观测向量移动顶点以优化位置。通过与减少交叉相关的局部奖励信号提供反馈。初始布局采用基于压力模型的图绘制算法。

Result: 与力导向、压力基础算法以及三种现有全局交叉最小化算法进行对比实验，结果显示混合：当前算法主要在局部交叉数优化方面具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 该方法在局部交叉数优化方面表现不错，但需要进一步发展。强化学习在图绘制领域具有潜力，未来有可能通过更多发展提升性能。

Abstract: We present a novel approach to graph drawing based on reinforcement learning
for minimizing the global and the local crossing number, that is, the total
number of edge crossings and the maximum number of crossings on any edge,
respectively. In our framework, an agent learns how to move a vertex based on a
given observation vector in order to optimize its position. The agent receives
feedback in the form of local reward signals tied to crossing reduction. To
generate an initial layout, we use a stress-based graph-drawing algorithm. We
compare our method against force- and stress-based (baseline) algorithms as
well as three established algorithms for global crossing minimization on a
suite of benchmark graphs. The experiments show mixed results: our current
algorithm is mainly competitive for the local crossing number. We see a
potential for further development of the approach in the future.
