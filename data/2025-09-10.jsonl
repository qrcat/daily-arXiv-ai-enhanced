As a consequence, tiling a given periodic subset of the\nplane with a given tromino (L or I) is co-RE-complete.\n  We also prove co-RE-completeness of tiling the entire plane with two\npolyominoes (one of which is disconnected and the other of which has constant\nsize), and of tiling 3D space with two connected polycubes (one of which has\nconstant size). If we restrict to tiling by translation only (no rotation),\nthen we obtain co-RE-completeness with one more tile: two trominoes for a\nperiodic subset of 2D, three polyominoes for the 2D plane, and three connected\npolycubes for 3D space.\n  Along the way, we prove several new complexity and algorithmic results about\nperiodic (infinite) graphs.

Model-based and learning-based methods\nare widely used in autonomous driving. Model-based methods rely on pre-defined\nmodels of the environment and may struggle with unforeseen events. Proximal\npolicy optimization (PPO), an advanced learning-based method, can adapt to the\nabove limits by learning from interactions with the environment. However,\nexisting PPO faces challenges with poor training results, and low training\nefficiency in long sequences. Moreover, the poor training results are\nequivalent to collisions in driving tasks. To solve these issues, this paper\ndevelops an improved PPO by introducing the risk-aware mechanism, a\nrisk-attention decision network, a balanced reward function, and a\nsafety-assisted mechanism. The risk-aware mechanism focuses on highlighting\nareas with potential collisions, facilitating safe-driving learning of the PPO.\nThe balanced reward function adjusts rewards based on the number of surrounding\nvehicles, promoting efficient exploration of the control strategy during\ntraining. Additionally, the risk-attention network enhances the PPO to hold\nchannel and spatial attention for the high-risk areas of input images.\nMoreover, the safety-assisted mechanism supervises and prevents the actions\nwith risks of collisions during the lane keeping and lane changing. Simulation\nresults on a physical engine demonstrate that the proposed algorithm\noutperforms benchmark algorithms in collision avoidance, achieving higher peak\nreward with less training time, and shorter driving time remaining on the risky\nareas among multiple testing traffic flow scenarios."}

To address this limitation, we\nintroduce Graph-Fused Vision-Language-Action (GF-VLA), a unified framework that\nenables dual-arm robotic systems to perform task-level reasoning and execution\ndirectly from RGB-D human demonstrations. GF-VLA employs an\ninformation-theoretic approach to extract task-relevant cues, selectively\nhighlighting critical hand-object and object-object interactions. These cues\nare structured into temporally ordered scene graphs, which are subsequently\nintegrated with a language-conditioned transformer to produce hierarchical\nbehavior trees and interpretable Cartesian motion primitives. To enhance\nefficiency in bimanual execution, we propose a cross-arm allocation strategy\nthat autonomously determines gripper assignment without requiring explicit\ngeometric modeling. We validate GF-VLA on four dual-arm block assembly\nbenchmarks involving symbolic structure construction and spatial\ngeneralization.

However, this paradigm is hindered by representation\nmisalignment: LLMs process high-level semantic tokens, whereas 3D point clouds\nconvey only dense geometric structures. In prior methods, misalignment limits\nboth input and output. At the input stage, dense point patches require heavy\npre-alignment, weakening object-level semantics and confusing similar\ndistractors. At the output stage, predictions depend only on dense features\nwithout explicit geometric cues, leading to a loss of fine-grained accuracy. To\naddress these limitations, we present the Point Linguist Model (PLM), a general\nframework that bridges the representation gap between LLMs and dense 3D point\nclouds without requiring large-scale pre-alignment between 3D-text or\n3D-images.

Our design not only\nsignificantly improves the network's ability to model high-frequency reflection\ndistributions but also effectively handles surfaces with a wide range of\nglossiness levels, from highly glossy to low-gloss finishes. Meanwhile, our\nmethod reduces the network's burden in fitting complex radiance distributions,\nallowing the overall architecture to remain compact and efficient.\nComprehensive experimental results demonstrate that our method consistently\nproduces high-quality, noise-free renderings in real time under various\nglossiness conditions, and delivers superior fidelity and realism compared to\nbaseline approaches."}

Recurrent controllers\nstruggle with long-horizon credit assignment, and Transformer-based fusion\nincurs quadratic cost in token length, limiting temporal and spatial context.\nWe present a vision-driven cross-modal RL framework built on SSD-Mamba2, a\nselective state-space backbone that applies state-space duality (SSD) to enable\nboth recurrent and convolutional scanning with hardware-aware streaming and\nnear-linear scaling. Proprioceptive states and exteroceptive observations\n(e.g., depth tokens) are encoded into compact tokens and fused by stacked\nSSD-Mamba2 layers. The selective state-space updates retain long-range\ndependencies with markedly lower latency and memory use than quadratic\nself-attention, enabling longer look-ahead, higher token resolution, and stable\ntraining under limited compute. Policies are trained end-to-end under curricula\nthat randomize terrain and appearance and progressively increase scene\ncomplexity. A compact, state-centric reward balances task progress, energy\nefficiency, and safety. Across diverse motion-control scenarios, our approach\nconsistently surpasses strong state-of-the-art baselines in return, safety\n(collisions and falls), and sample efficiency, while converging faster at the\nsame compute budget. These results suggest that SSD-Mamba2 provides a practical\nfusion backbone for scalable, foresightful, and efficient end-to-end motion\ncontrol."}
