TL;DR: 这篇论文是关于3D和4D世界建模的首次综合调查，填补了现有研究主要关注2D图像生成而忽略3D/4D表示的空白，并建立了标准化的定义和分类体系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有世界建模研究主要关注2D图像和视频生成，忽视了快速发展的3D和4D表示方法（如RGB-D图像、占据网格、LiDAR点云），且缺乏标准化的定义和分类体系，导致文献中的主张碎片化且不一致。

Method: 通过建立精确的定义，引入结构化分类体系（包括基于视频的VideoGen、基于占据的OccGen和基于LiDAR的LiDARGen方法），系统总结3D/4D设置下的数据集和评估指标。

Result: 提出了首个专门针对3D和4D世界建模与生成的全面综述，为领域提供了连贯和基础性的参考框架。

Conclusion: 该调查填补了3D/4D世界建模的研究空白，建立了标准化框架，讨论了实际应用、开放挑战和有前景的研究方向，为领域发展提供了重要参考。

Abstract: World modeling has become a cornerstone in AI research, enabling agents to
understand, represent, and predict the dynamic environments they inhabit. While
prior work largely emphasizes generative methods for 2D image and video data,
they overlook the rapidly growing body of work that leverages native 3D and 4D
representations such as RGB-D imagery, occupancy grids, and LiDAR point clouds
for large-scale scene modeling. At the same time, the absence of a standardized
definition and taxonomy for ``world models'' has led to fragmented and
sometimes inconsistent claims in the literature. This survey addresses these
gaps by presenting the first comprehensive review explicitly dedicated to 3D
and 4D world modeling and generation. We establish precise definitions,
introduce a structured taxonomy spanning video-based (VideoGen),
occupancy-based (OccGen), and LiDAR-based (LiDARGen) approaches, and
systematically summarize datasets and evaluation metrics tailored to 3D/4D
settings. We further discuss practical applications, identify open challenges,
and highlight promising research directions, aiming to provide a coherent and
foundational reference for advancing the field. A systematic summary of
existing literature is available at https://github.com/worldbench/survey

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: XFloodNet是一个基于深度学习的城市洪水分类框架，通过多模态特征融合和分层注意力机制，在三个基准数据集上实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统洪水检测方法依赖单模态数据和静态规则系统，无法捕捉洪水事件的动态非线性关系，现有注意力机制和集成学习方法在分层细化、跨模态特征集成和对噪声环境的适应性方面存在局限。

Method: 提出XFloodNet框架，包含三个核心组件：分层跨模态门控注意力机制、异构卷积自适应多尺度注意力模块、以及级联卷积变换器特征细化技术，实现视觉和文本特征的动态对齐和多粒度交互。

Result: 在Chennai Floods、Rhine18 Floods和Harz17 Floods三个数据集上分别达到93.33%、82.24%和88.60%的F1分数，显著超越现有方法。

Conclusion: XFloodNet通过先进的深度学习技术重新定义了城市洪水分类，在动态特征对齐、多尺度特征提取和噪声鲁棒性方面表现出色，为可持续城市的洪水管理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In an era of escalating climate change, urban flooding has emerged as a
critical challenge for sustainable cities, threatening lives, infrastructure,
and ecosystems. Traditional flood detection methods are constrained by their
reliance on unimodal data and static rule-based systems, which fail to capture
the dynamic, non-linear relationships inherent in flood events. Furthermore,
existing attention mechanisms and ensemble learning approaches exhibit
limitations in hierarchical refinement, cross-modal feature integration, and
adaptability to noisy or unstructured environments, resulting in suboptimal
flood classification performance. To address these challenges, we present
XFloodNet, a novel framework that redefines urban flood classification through
advanced deep-learning techniques. XFloodNet integrates three novel components:
(1) a Hierarchical Cross-Modal Gated Attention mechanism that dynamically
aligns visual and textual features, enabling precise multi-granularity
interactions and resolving contextual ambiguities; (2) a Heterogeneous
Convolutional Adaptive Multi-Scale Attention module, which leverages
frequency-enhanced channel attention and frequency-modulated spatial attention
to extract and prioritize discriminative flood-related features across spectral
and spatial domains; and (3) a Cascading Convolutional Transformer Feature
Refinement technique that harmonizes hierarchical features through adaptive
scaling and cascading operations, ensuring robust and noise-resistant flood
detection. We evaluate our proposed method on three benchmark datasets, such as
Chennai Floods, Rhine18 Floods, and Harz17 Floods, XFloodNet achieves
state-of-the-art F1-scores of 93.33%, 82.24%, and 88.60%, respectively,
surpassing existing methods by significant margins.

### [3] [Video Parallel Scaling: Aggregating Diverse Frame Subsets for VideoLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08016)
*Hyungjin Chung,Hyelin Nam,Jiyeon Kim,Hyojun Go,Byeongjun Park,Junho Kim,Joonseok Lee,Seongsu Ha,Byung-Hoon Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Video Parallel Scaling (VPS) 是一种推理时方法，通过并行处理视频帧子集来扩展VideoLLMs的感知带宽，避免长上下文窗口带来的计算成本问题，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VideoLLMs在处理更多输入帧以捕获细粒度时间细节时面临计算成本过高和长上下文长度导致的性能下降问题。

Method: VPS运行多个并行推理流，每个流处理视频帧的不同子集，然后聚合这些互补流的输出概率来整合更丰富的视觉信息。

Result: 在多个模型架构和规模（2B-32B）上的实验表明，VPS在Video-MME和EventHallusion等基准测试中持续显著提升性能，比其他并行方法更具扩展优势。

Conclusion: VPS提供了一个内存高效且鲁棒的框架，用于增强VideoLLMs的时间推理能力，且与其他解码策略互补。

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) face a critical bottleneck:
increasing the number of input frames to capture fine-grained temporal detail
leads to prohibitive computational costs and performance degradation from long
context lengths. We introduce Video Parallel Scaling (VPS), an inference-time
method that expands a model's perceptual bandwidth without increasing its
context window. VPS operates by running multiple parallel inference streams,
each processing a unique, disjoint subset of the video's frames. By aggregating
the output probabilities from these complementary streams, VPS integrates a
richer set of visual information than is possible with a single pass. We
theoretically show that this approach effectively contracts the Chinchilla
scaling law by leveraging uncorrelated visual evidence, thereby improving
performance without additional training. Extensive experiments across various
model architectures and scales (2B-32B) on benchmarks such as Video-MME and
EventHallusion demonstrate that VPS consistently and significantly improves
performance. It scales more favorably than other parallel alternatives (e.g.
Self-consistency) and is complementary to other decoding strategies, offering a
memory-efficient and robust framework for enhancing the temporal reasoning
capabilities of VideoLLMs.

TL;DR: 多模态立场检测框架，通过大语言模型和图片描述器整合文本与视觉信息，在气候变化数据集上超越现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有立场检测方法仅关注文本数据，而现实社交媒体内容日益结合文本与视觉元素，需要先进的多模态方法

Method: 使用大语言模型提取文本摘要，基于领域知识的图片描述生成器解释视觉内容，通过专门的transformer模块关合建模文本和图像

Result: 在MultiClimate数据集上达到准确率76.2%、精度76.3%、召回率76.2%和F1得76.2%，超越现有最优方法

Conclusion: 该多模态框架能够有效整合多种模态信息，实现更稳健的立场分类，为社交媒体分析提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of information across digital platforms, stance
detection has emerged as a pivotal challenge in social media analysis. While
most of the existing approaches focus solely on textual data, real-world social
media content increasingly combines text with visual elements creating a need
for advanced multimodal methods. To address this gap, we propose a multimodal
stance detection framework that integrates textual and visual information
through a hierarchical fusion approach. Our method first employs a Large
Language Model to retrieve stance-relevant summaries from source text, while a
domain-aware image caption generator interprets visual content in the context
of the target topic. These modalities are then jointly modeled along with the
reply text, through a specialized transformer module that captures interactions
between the texts and images. The proposed modality fusion framework integrates
diverse modalities to facilitate robust stance classification. We evaluate our
approach on the MultiClimate dataset, a benchmark for climate change-related
stance detection containing aligned video frames and transcripts. We achieve
accuracy of 76.2%, precision of 76.3%, recall of 76.2% and F1-score of 76.2%,
respectively, outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches.

Na\"ive Bayes), resulting in 15 different base learners. These are aggregated
via weighted averaging to classify regions as Car, Van, Truck, Bus, or
background. Hyperparameters are optimized with the whale optimization algorithm
to balance accuracy, precision, and recall. Implemented in MATLAB R2020b with
parallel processing, SI-EDTL outperforms existing methods on the AU-AIR UAV

*Rafał Osadnik,Pablo Gómez,Eleni Bohacek,Rickbir Bahia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提供了一个新的火星数字高程模型预测数据集MCTED，包含8万多个样本，并通过对比训练证明了专门训练的小模型在高程预测任务上超过了大型基础模型的零样本性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决火星数字高程模型预测任务中的数据缺失和人工假象问题，为机器学习应用提供高质量的训练数据集。

Method: 使用火星迷信轨道器CTX仪器收集的高分辨率正弄图像和DEM数据，通过处理管道生成80,898个样本，每个样本包含光学图像补丁、DEM补丁和两个掩码补丁。数据集分为训练集和验证集，避免数据泄漏。

Conclusion: MCTED数据集为火星高程模型预测提供了高质量的训练资源，小型专门模型在该任务上可以获得比大型基础模型更好的性能，数据集已开源发布。

Abstract: This work presents a new dataset for the Martian digital elevation model
prediction task, ready for machine learning applications called MCTED. The
dataset has been generated using a comprehensive pipeline designed to process
high-resolution Mars orthoimage and DEM pairs from Day et al., yielding a
dataset consisting of 80,898 data samples. The source images are data gathered
by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter using the CTX instrument, providing a very
diverse and comprehensive coverage of the Martian surface. Given the complexity
of the processing pipelines used in large-scale DEMs, there are often artefacts
and missing data points in the original data, for which we developed tools to
solve or mitigate their impact. We divide the processed samples into training
and validation splits, ensuring samples in both splits cover no mutual areas to
avoid data leakage. Every sample in the dataset is represented by the optical
image patch, DEM patch, and two mask patches, indicating values that were
originally missing or were altered by us. This allows future users of the
dataset to handle altered elevation regions as they please. We provide
statistical insights of the generated dataset, including the spatial
distribution of samples, the distributions of elevation values, slopes and
more. Finally, we train a small U-Net architecture on the MCTED dataset and
compare its performance to a monocular depth estimation foundation model,
DepthAnythingV2, on the task of elevation prediction. We find that even a very
small architecture trained on this dataset specifically, beats a zero-shot
performance of a depth estimation foundation model like DepthAnythingV2. We
make the dataset and code used for its generation completely open source in
public repositories.

### [7] [APML: Adaptive Probabilistic Matching Loss for Robust 3D Point Cloud Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08104)
*Sasan Sharifipour,Constantino Álvarez Casado,Mohammad Sabokrou,Miguel Bordallo López*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出APML损失函数，通过可微分的概率匹配近似一对一对应，解决了传统点云损失函数的多对一对应问题和计算复杂度问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统点云损失函数（如CD、HyperCD、InfoCD）存在多对一对应问题，导致点云在密集区域拥堵、稀疏区域覆盖不足，且包含不可微操作；EMD虽然效果好但计算复杂度高

Method: 使用Sinkhorn迭代在温度缩放的相似度矩阵上进行概率匹配，自动计算温度参数保证最小分配概率，实现完全可微分的一对一匹配近似

Result: 在ShapeNet基准测试和WiFi CSI到3D人体点云生成任务中，APML损失实现了更快的收敛速度、更好的空间分布（特别是在低密度区域），以及相当或更好的定量性能

Conclusion: APML损失提供了一种计算高效、完全可微分的替代方案，能够有效解决点云预测任务中的点分布问题，无需额外的超参数调优

Abstract: Training deep learning models for point cloud prediction tasks such as shape
completion and generation depends critically on loss functions that measure
discrepancies between predicted and ground-truth point sets. Commonly used
functions such as Chamfer Distance (CD), HyperCD, and InfoCD rely on
nearest-neighbor assignments, which often induce many-to-one correspondences,
leading to point congestion in dense regions and poor coverage in sparse
regions. These losses also involve non-differentiable operations due to index
selection, which may affect gradient-based optimization. Earth Mover Distance
(EMD) enforces one-to-one correspondences and captures structural similarity
more effectively, but its cubic computational complexity limits its practical
use. We propose the Adaptive Probabilistic Matching Loss (APML), a fully
differentiable approximation of one-to-one matching that leverages Sinkhorn
iterations on a temperature-scaled similarity matrix derived from pairwise
distances. We analytically compute the temperature to guarantee a minimum
assignment probability, eliminating manual tuning. APML achieves near-quadratic
runtime, comparable to Chamfer-based losses, and avoids non-differentiable
operations. When integrated into state-of-the-art architectures (PoinTr, PCN,
FoldingNet) on ShapeNet benchmarks and on a spatiotemporal Transformer (CSI2PC)
that generates 3D human point clouds from WiFi CSI measurements, APM loss
yields faster convergence, superior spatial distribution, especially in
low-density regions, and improved or on-par quantitative performance without
additional hyperparameter search. The code is available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于RPCA的轻量级红外小目标检测框架L-RPCANet，通过分层瓶颈结构和噪声抑制模块实现参数轻量化和噪声鲁棒性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度展开网络在红外小目标检测中存在参数不够轻量和噪声鲁棒性不足的问题

Method: 构建分层瓶颈结构进行通道维度调整，嵌入噪声抑制模块，采用SENet通道注意力机制

Result: 在ISTD数据集上验证了优于RPCANet、DRPCANet、RPCANet++等先进方法的性能

Conclusion: L-RPCANet在保持轻量化和鲁棒性的同时实现了优异的检测性能

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (ISTD) is one of the key techniques in image
processing. Although deep unfolding networks (DUNs) have demonstrated promising
performance in ISTD due to their model interpretability and data adaptability,
existing methods still face significant challenges in parameter lightweightness
and noise robustness. In this regard, we propose a highly lightweight framework
based on robust principal component analysis (RPCA) called L-RPCANet.
Technically, a hierarchical bottleneck structure is constructed to reduce and
increase the channel dimension in the single-channel input infrared image to
achieve channel-wise feature refinement, with bottleneck layers designed in
each module to extract features. This reduces the number of channels in feature
extraction and improves the lightweightness of network parameters. Furthermore,
a noise reduction module is embedded to enhance the robustness against complex
noise. In addition, squeeze-and-excitation networks (SENets) are leveraged as a
channel attention mechanism to focus on the varying importance of different
features across channels, thereby achieving excellent performance while
maintaining both lightweightness and robustness. Extensive experiments on the
ISTD datasets validate the superiority of our proposed method compared with
state-of-the-art methods covering RPCANet, DRPCANet, and RPCANet++. The code
will be available at https://github.com/xianchaoxiu/L-RPCANet.

### [9] [Sparse Transformer for Ultra-sparse Sampled Video Compressive Sensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08228)
*Miao Cao,Siming Zheng,Lishun Wang,Ziyang Chen,David Brady,Xin Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了超稀疏采样(USS)策略和BSTFormer模型，通过降低采样率来大幅减少视频摄像的电力消耗，并实现更高的动态范围和固定曝光时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高分辨率高帧率摄像头的高电力消耗问题，传统的随机采样策略在极端情况下不可持续。

Method: 提出USS稀疏采样策略（每个空间位置只有一帧为1），并设计BSTFormer模型，结合局部坐标注意力、全局稀疏注意力和时间注意力来利用USS测量的稀疏性。

Result: 在模拟和实际数据上，方法显著超越了之前的最先进算法，并具有更高的动态范围和固定曝光时间的优势。

Conclusion: USS策略是实现芯片级视频SCI系统的良好选择，能够在大幅节省电力的同时保持高性能。

Abstract: Digital cameras consume ~0.1 microjoule per pixel to capture and encode
video, resulting in a power usage of ~20W for a 4K sensor operating at 30 fps.
Imagining gigapixel cameras operating at 100-1000 fps, the current processing
model is unsustainable. To address this, physical layer compressive measurement
has been proposed to reduce power consumption per pixel by 10-100X. Video
Snapshot Compressive Imaging (SCI) introduces high frequency modulation in the
optical sensor layer to increase effective frame rate. A commonly used sampling
strategy of video SCI is Random Sampling (RS) where each mask element value is
randomly set to be 0 or 1. Similarly, image inpainting (I2P) has demonstrated
that images can be recovered from a fraction of the image pixels. Inspired by
I2P, we propose Ultra-Sparse Sampling (USS) regime, where at each spatial
location, only one sub-frame is set to 1 and all others are set to 0. We then
build a Digital Micro-mirror Device (DMD) encoding system to verify the
effectiveness of our USS strategy. Ideally, we can decompose the USS
measurement into sub-measurements for which we can utilize I2P algorithms to
recover high-speed frames. However, due to the mismatch between the DMD and
CCD, the USS measurement cannot be perfectly decomposed. To this end, we
propose BSTFormer, a sparse TransFormer that utilizes local Block attention,
global Sparse attention, and global Temporal attention to exploit the sparsity
of the USS measurement. Extensive results on both simulated and real-world data
show that our method significantly outperforms all previous state-of-the-art
algorithms. Additionally, an essential advantage of the USS strategy is its
higher dynamic range than that of the RS strategy. Finally, from the
application perspective, the USS strategy is a good choice to implement a
complete video SCI system on chip due to its fixed exposure time.

Motivation: 现有视频异常检测方法难以检测枪击和刺伤等致命事件，主要因为这些事件罕见且存在数据收集的伦理问题

Method: 使用GTA5游戏构建致命暴力数据集，包含多视角CCTV视频；提出基于Wasserstein对抗训练的片段级域适应策略，缩小合成数据与真实数据特征差距

Result: 实验验证了GTA-Crime数据集的有效性，结合域适应策略能够持续提升真实世界致命暴力检测准确率

Conclusion: GTA-Crime为致命暴力检测提供了可行的合成数据解决方案，域适应策略有效解决了合成数据与真实数据的差异问题

Abstract: Recent advancements in video anomaly detection (VAD) have enabled
identification of various criminal activities in surveillance videos, but
detecting fatal incidents such as shootings and stabbings remains difficult due
to their rarity and ethical issues in data collection. Recognizing this
limitation, we introduce GTA-Crime, a fatal video anomaly dataset and
generation framework using Grand Theft Auto 5 (GTA5). Our dataset contains
fatal situations such as shootings and stabbings, captured from CCTV multiview
perspectives under diverse conditions including action types, weather, time of
day, and viewpoints. To address the rarity of such scenarios, we also release a
framework for generating these types of videos. Additionally, we propose a
snippet-level domain adaptation strategy using Wasserstein adversarial training
to bridge the gap between synthetic GTA-Crime features and real-world features
like UCF-Crime. Experimental results validate our GTA-Crime dataset and
demonstrate that incorporating GTA-Crime with our domain adaptation strategy
consistently enhances real world fatal violence detection accuracy. Our dataset
and the data generation framework are publicly available at

Motivation: 解决Vision Transformers预训练需要三通道输入而胸部X光图像是单通道灰度图的不匹配问题，避免信息损失

Method: 使用通道复制策略将单通道CXR图像复制为三通道格式，适配ViT架构输入要求

Result: 在三个基准数据集上表现优异：TB-CXR数据集准确率99.9%、AUC 99.9%；儿科肺炎数据集准确率99.0%、AUC 99.0%；深圳TB数据集准确率91.1%、AUC 91.2%

Conclusion: 简单有效的通道复制策略使ViT能够在灰度医学图像任务中充分发挥表征能力，为TB和肺炎检测建立了新的最先进方法

Abstract: Chest X-ray (CXR) imaging remains one of the most widely used diagnostic
tools for detecting pulmonary diseases such as tuberculosis (TB) and pneumonia.
Recent advances in deep learning, particularly Vision Transformers (ViTs), have
shown strong potential for automated medical image analysis. However, most ViT
architectures are pretrained on natural images and require three-channel
inputs, while CXR scans are inherently grayscale. To address this gap, we
propose RepViT-CXR, a channel replication strategy that adapts single-channel
CXR images into a ViT-compatible format without introducing additional
information loss. We evaluate RepViT-CXR on three benchmark datasets. On the
TB-CXR dataset,our method achieved an accuracy of 99.9% and an AUC of 99.9%,
surpassing prior state-of-the-art methods such as Topo-CXR (99.3% accuracy,
99.8% AUC). For the Pediatric Pneumonia dataset, RepViT-CXR obtained 99.0%
accuracy, with 99.2% recall, 99.3% precision, and an AUC of 99.0%,
outperforming strong baselines including DCNN and VGG16. On the Shenzhen TB
dataset, our approach achieved 91.1% accuracy and an AUC of 91.2%, marking a
performance improvement over previously reported CNN-based methods. These
results demonstrate that a simple yet effective channel replication strategy
allows ViTs to fully leverage their representational power on grayscale medical
imaging tasks. RepViT-CXR establishes a new state of the art for TB and
pneumonia detection from chest X-rays, showing strong potential for deployment
in real-world clinical screening systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合3D CNN编码器和对称交互Transformer的端到端网络，用于检测阿尔茨海默病引起的脑部不对称萎缩，在ADNI数据集上达到92.5%的诊断准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究大多基于预训练或忽略了脑部疾病引起的不对称特征，需要一种能够关注AD引起的结构不对称变化的诊断方法。

Method: 使用3D CNN编码器提取特征，通过对称交互Transformer(SIT)处理左右半球对齐的特征，重点关注由结构变化引起的不对称区域。

Result: 在ADNI数据集上达到92.5%的诊断准确率，优于多种CNN方法和CNN结合通用transformer的方法，可视化结果显示网络能更好地关注脑萎缩区域。

Conclusion: 该方法通过关注AD引起的不对称病理特征，提高了诊断性能，同时具有良好的可解释性和有效性。

Abstract: Structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) combined with deep learning has
achieved remarkable progress in the prediction and diagnosis of Alzheimer's
disease (AD). Existing studies have used CNN and transformer to build a
well-performing network, but most of them are based on pretraining or ignoring
the asymmetrical character caused by brain disorders. We propose an end-to-end
network for the detection of disease-based asymmetric induced by left and right
brain atrophy which consist of 3D CNN Encoder and Symmetry Interactive
Transformer (SIT). Following the inter-equal grid block fetch operation, the
corresponding left and right hemisphere features are aligned and subsequently
fed into the SIT for diagnostic analysis. SIT can help the model focus more on
the regions of asymmetry caused by structural changes, thus improving
diagnostic performance. We evaluated our method based on the ADNI dataset, and
the results show that the method achieves better diagnostic accuracy (92.5\%)
compared to several CNN methods and CNNs combined with a general transformer.
The visualization results show that our network pays more attention in regions
of brain atrophy, especially for the asymmetric pathological characteristics
induced by AD, demonstrating the interpretability and effectiveness of the
method.

Abstract: Frame-based cameras with extended exposure times often produce perceptible
visual blurring and information loss between frames, significantly degrading
video quality. To address this challenge, we introduce EVDI++, a unified
self-supervised framework for Event-based Video Deblurring and Interpolation
that leverages the high temporal resolution of event cameras to mitigate motion
blur and enable intermediate frame prediction. Specifically, the Learnable
Double Integral (LDI) network is designed to estimate the mapping relation
between reference frames and sharp latent images. Then, we refine the coarse
results and optimize overall training efficiency by introducing a
learning-based division reconstruction module, enabling images to be converted
with varying exposure intervals. We devise an adaptive parameter-free fusion
strategy to obtain the final results, utilizing the confidence embedded in the
LDI outputs of concurrent events. A self-supervised learning framework is
proposed to enable network training with real-world blurry videos and events by
exploring the mutual constraints among blurry frames, latent images, and event
streams. We further construct a dataset with real-world blurry images and
events using a DAVIS346c camera, demonstrating the generalizability of the
proposed EVDI++ in real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments on both
synthetic and real-world datasets show that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance in video deblurring and interpolation tasks.

TL;DR: 提出HyMamba网络，通过状态空间模块统一建模光谱、跨深度和时间信息，在多个基准数据集上实现最先进的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有高光谱目标跟踪方法无法有效捕捉内在光谱信息、时间依赖性和跨深度交互，需要新的解决方案

Method: 使用Spectral State Integration (SSI)模块和Hyperspectral Mamba (HSM)模块，通过三个方向扫描的状态空间模块同步学习空间和光谱信息

Result: 在HOTC2020数据集上达到73.0%的AUC分数和96.3%的DP@20分数，在七个基准数据集上表现优异

Conclusion: HyMamba网络通过统一建模光谱、跨深度和时间信息，在高光谱目标跟踪任务中取得了显著的性能提升

Abstract: Hyperspectral object tracking holds great promise due to the rich spectral
information and fine-grained material distinctions in hyperspectral images,
which are beneficial in challenging scenarios. While existing hyperspectral
trackers have made progress by either transforming hyperspectral data into
false-color images or incorporating modality fusion strategies, they often fail
to capture the intrinsic spectral information, temporal dependencies, and
cross-depth interactions. To address these limitations, a new hyperspectral
object tracking network equipped with Mamba (HyMamba), is proposed. It unifies
spectral, cross-depth, and temporal modeling through state space modules
(SSMs). The core of HyMamba lies in the Spectral State Integration (SSI)
module, which enables progressive refinement and propagation of spectral
features with cross-depth and temporal spectral information. Embedded within
each SSI, the Hyperspectral Mamba (HSM) module is introduced to learn spatial
and spectral information synchronously via three directional scanning SSMs.
Based on SSI and HSM, HyMamba constructs joint features from false-color and
hyperspectral inputs, and enhances them through interaction with original
spectral features extracted from raw hyperspectral images. Extensive
experiments conducted on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that HyMamba
achieves state-of-the-art performance. For instance, it achieves 73.0\% of the
AUC score and 96.3\% of the DP@20 score on the HOTC2020 dataset. The code will
be released at https://github.com/lgao001/HyMamba.

TL;DR: VLMs依赖训练偏见回答视觉问题，对特定问题表现不佳。研究开发多维度框架分析输入数据特征如何影响性能，发现微小修改可导致VLM回答方式和性能的显著变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究表明VLMs在处理需要关注图像特定区域的精确问题时，会依赖训练偏见而忽视视觉证据，导致回答不准确。需要系统研究输入数据特征如何影响VLM性能。

Method: 开发多维度检查框架，使用开源VLMs分析不同输入参数（如图像大小、物体数量、背景颜色、提示词特异性）对注意力值波动的影响，系统研究VLM行为变化。

Result: 研究发现即使图像特征和提示词特异性的微小修改，也会导致VLM回答方式和整体性能的巨大变化，证实了输入参数对模型行为的显著影响。

Conclusion: VLMs对输入数据特征高度敏感，需要系统方法来表征和理解这种敏感性，为改进模型鲁棒性和性能提供重要见解。

Abstract: Recent research on Vision Language Models (VLMs) suggests that they rely on
inherent biases learned during training to respond to questions about visual
properties of an image. These biases are exacerbated when VLMs are asked highly
specific questions that require focusing on specific areas of the image. For
example, a VLM tasked with counting stars on a modified American flag (e.g.,
with more than 50 stars) will often disregard the visual evidence and fail to
answer accurately. We build upon this research and develop a multi-dimensional
examination framework to systematically determine which characteristics of the
input data, including both the image and the accompanying prompt, lead to such
differences in performance. Using open-source VLMs, we further examine how
attention values fluctuate with varying input parameters (e.g., image size,
number of objects in the image, background color, prompt specificity). This
research aims to learn how the behavior of vision language models changes and
to explore methods for characterizing such changes. Our results suggest, among
other things, that even minor modifications in image characteristics and prompt
specificity can lead to large changes in how a VLM formulates its answer and,
subsequently, its overall performance.

TL;DR: E3DPC-GZSL是一种新的3D点云广义零样本语义分割方法，通过证据不确定性估计和动态校准机制解决对已见类的过拟合问题，在ScanNet v2和S3DIS数据集上达到最先进性能。

Motivation: 解决3D点云广义零样本语义分割中模型对已见类的预测偏见问题，特别是在训练数据规模较小的3D应用中，模型容易过度自信地预测已见类。

Method: 提出E3DPC-GZSL方法：1）在分类器中集成基于证据的不确定性估计器；2）使用动态校准堆叠因子根据点级预测不确定性调整概率；3）通过合并可学习参数和文本特征改进语义空间，提升对未见数据的优化。

Conclusion: E3DPC-GZSL通过不确定性估计和语义空间优化有效解决了3D点云零样本分割中的过拟合问题，无需为已见和未见数据使用单独分类器。

Abstract: Generalized zero-shot semantic segmentation of 3D point clouds aims to
classify each point into both seen and unseen classes. A significant challenge
with these models is their tendency to make biased predictions, often favoring
the classes encountered during training. This problem is more pronounced in 3D
applications, where the scale of the training data is typically smaller than in
image-based tasks. To address this problem, we propose a novel method called
E3DPC-GZSL, which reduces overconfident predictions towards seen classes
without relying on separate classifiers for seen and unseen data. E3DPC-GZSL
tackles the overconfidence problem by integrating an evidence-based uncertainty
estimator into a classifier. This estimator is then used to adjust prediction
probabilities using a dynamic calibrated stacking factor that accounts for
pointwise prediction uncertainty. In addition, E3DPC-GZSL introduces a novel
training strategy that improves uncertainty estimation by refining the semantic
space. This is achieved by merging learnable parameters with text-derived
features, thereby improving model optimization for unseen data. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art
performance on generalized zero-shot semantic segmentation datasets, including
ScanNet v2 and S3DIS.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种改进的弱监督物体检测方法，通过热力图导向建议选择算法、增强的基础检测网络和负确定性监督损失，解决了现有方法在假标签生成、语义差距和收敛速度方面的三个关键问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的弱监督物体检测方法存在三个主要问题：1）假标签盒要么只关注区分部位而不能抓取整个物体，要么覆盖整个物体但无法区分相邻的类内实例；2）WSDDN网络缺乏背景类表征且分支间语义差距较大；3）忽略建议在优化中被丢弃，导致收敛慢。

Method: 提出了三个核心组件：1）热力图导向建议选择器（HGPS），利用双阈值在热力图上预选建议，使假标签盒既能抓取整个物体又能区分相邻实例；2）弱监督基础检测网络（WSBDN），为每个建议增加背景类表征并使用热力图进行预监督来缩小语义差距；3）在忽略建议上应用负确定性监督损失来加速收敛。

Result: 在PASCAL VOC 2007和2012数据集上进行了广泛实验，在VOC 2007上达到了58.5%的mAP和81.8%的mCorLoc，在VOC 2012上达到了55.6%的mAP和80.5%的mCorLoc，表现优于现有的最先进弱监督物体检测方法。

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法通过热力图导向的建议选择、增强的基础检测网络和负确定性监督损失，有效解决了弱监督物体检测中的三个关键挑战，在标准数据集上取得了优异的性能。

Abstract: Weakly supervised object detection (WSOD) has attracted significant attention
in recent years, as it does not require box-level annotations. State-of-the-art
methods generally adopt a multi-module network, which employs WSDDN as the
multiple instance detection network module and multiple instance refinement
modules to refine performance. However, these approaches suffer from three key
limitations. First, existing methods tend to generate pseudo GT boxes that
either focus only on discriminative parts, failing to capture the whole object,
or cover the entire object but fail to distinguish between adjacent intra-class
instances. Second, the foundational WSDDN architecture lacks a crucial
background class representation for each proposal and exhibits a large semantic
gap between its branches. Third, prior methods discard ignored proposals during
optimization, leading to slow convergence. To address these challenges, we
first design a heatmap-guided proposal selector (HGPS) algorithm, which
utilizes dual thresholds on heatmaps to pre-select proposals, enabling pseudo
GT boxes to both capture the full object extent and distinguish between
adjacent intra-class instances. We then present a weakly supervised basic
detection network (WSBDN), which augments each proposal with a background class
representation and uses heatmaps for pre-supervision to bridge the semantic gap
between matrices. At last, we introduce a negative certainty supervision loss
on ignored proposals to accelerate convergence. Extensive experiments on the
challenging PASCAL VOC 2007 and 2012 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of
our framework. We achieve mAP/mCorLoc scores of 58.5%/81.8% on VOC 2007 and
55.6%/80.5% on VOC 2012, performing favorably against the state-of-the-art WSOD
methods. Our code is publicly available at

Abstract: Oil palm cultivation remains one of the leading causes of deforestation in
Indonesia. To better track and address this challenge, detailed and reliable
mapping is needed to support sustainability efforts and emerging regulatory
frameworks. We present an open-access geospatial dataset of oil palm
plantations and related land cover types in Indonesia, produced through expert
labeling of high-resolution satellite imagery from 2020 to 2024. The dataset
provides polygon-based, wall-to-wall annotations across a range of
agro-ecological zones and includes a hierarchical typology that distinguishes
oil palm planting stages as well as similar perennial crops. Quality was
ensured through multi-interpreter consensus and field validation. The dataset
was created using wall-to-wall digitization over large grids, making it
suitable for training and benchmarking both conventional convolutional neural
networks and newer geospatial foundation models. Released under a CC-BY
license, it fills a key gap in training data for remote sensing and aims to
improve the accuracy of land cover types mapping. By supporting transparent
monitoring of oil palm expansion, the resource contributes to global
deforestation reduction goals and follows FAIR data principles.

Conclusion: SimCroP框架通过相似性驱动对齐和跨粒度融合，有效提升了稀疏放射图像中关键病理结构的捕捉能力，在多尺度下游任务中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Medical vision-language pre-training shows great potential in learning
representative features from massive paired radiographs and reports. However,
in computed tomography (CT) scans, the distribution of lesions which contain
intricate structures is characterized by spatial sparsity. Besides, the complex
and implicit relationships between different pathological descriptions in each
sentence of the report and their corresponding sub-regions in radiographs pose
additional challenges. In this paper, we propose a Similarity-Driven
Cross-Granularity Pre-training (SimCroP) framework on chest CTs, which combines
similarity-driven alignment and cross-granularity fusion to improve radiograph
interpretation. We first leverage multi-modal masked modeling to optimize the
encoder for understanding precise low-level semantics from radiographs. Then,
similarity-driven alignment is designed to pre-train the encoder to adaptively
select and align the correct patches corresponding to each sentence in reports.
The cross-granularity fusion module integrates multimodal information across
instance level and word-patch level, which helps the model better capture key
pathology structures in sparse radiographs, resulting in improved performance
for multi-scale downstream tasks. SimCroP is pre-trained on a large-scale
paired CT-reports dataset and validated on image classification and
segmentation tasks across five public datasets. Experimental results
demonstrate that SimCroP outperforms both cutting-edge medical self-supervised
learning methods and medical vision-language pre-training methods. Codes and
models are available at https://github.com/ToniChopp/SimCroP.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BTS-EE是一种顺序训练方法，通过逐层训练和校准早期退出分支，解决了传统训练中的协方差偏移问题，在保持精度的同时显著减少计算量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实时图像分类在资源受限平台上需要平衡精度和延迟/功耗。传统早期退出策略存在协方差偏移问题：下游分支在全数据集上训练，但推理时只处理未被退出的困难样本，导致效率-精度权衡受限。

Method: 提出Boosted Training Scheme for Early Exits (BTS-EE)顺序训练方法，逐层训练和校准分支；设计基于1D卷积的轻量级分支架构；提出Class Precision Margin (CPM)校准方法进行逐类阈值调优。

Result: 在CINIC-10数据集和ResNet18骨干网络上，BTS-EE在64种配置下均优于非增强训练，计算量减少高达45%，精度仅下降2%。

Conclusion: BTS-EE扩展了CNN在实时图像处理系统中的部署设计空间，为工业检测、嵌入式视觉和无人机监控等应用提供了实用的效率提升。

Abstract: Real-time image classification on resource-constrained platforms demands
inference methods that balance accuracy with strict latency and power budgets.
Early-exit strategies address this need by attaching auxiliary classifiers to
intermediate layers of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), allowing "easy"
samples to terminate inference early. However, conventional training of early
exits introduces a covariance shift: downstream branches are trained on full
datasets, while at inference they process only the harder, non-exited samples.
This mismatch limits efficiency--accuracy trade-offs in practice. We introduce
the Boosted Training Scheme for Early Exits (BTS-EE), a sequential training
approach that aligns branch training with inference-time data distributions.
Each branch is trained and calibrated before the next, ensuring robustness
under selective inference conditions. To further support embedded deployment,
we propose a lightweight branch architecture based on 1D convolutions and a
Class Precision Margin (CPM) calibration method that enables per-class
threshold tuning for reliable exit decisions. Experiments on the CINIC-10
dataset with a ResNet18 backbone demonstrate that BTS-EE consistently
outperforms non-boosted training across 64 configurations, achieving up to 45
percent reduction in computation with only 2 percent accuracy degradation.
These results expand the design space for deploying CNNs in real-time image
processing systems, offering practical efficiency gains for applications such
as industrial inspection, embedded vision, and UAV-based monitoring.

Abstract: Accurate and early diagnosis of malignant melanoma is critical for improving
patient outcomes. While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown promise
in dermoscopic image analysis, they often neglect clinical metadata and require
extensive preprocessing. Vision-language models (VLMs) offer a multimodal
alternative but struggle to capture clinical specificity when trained on
general-domain data. To address this, we propose a retrieval-augmented VLM
framework that incorporates semantically similar patient cases into the
diagnostic prompt. Our method enables informed predictions without fine-tuning
and significantly improves classification accuracy and error correction over
conventional baselines. These results demonstrate that retrieval-augmented
prompting provides a robust strategy for clinical decision support.

Abstract: Three-dimensional Object Detection from multi-view cameras and LiDAR is a

mitigating the impact of accumulated errors. Additionally, by incorporating
attention mechanisms applied to the raw features, it thereby mitigates the
impact of accumulated errors. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate
that InsFusion is compatible with various advanced baseline methods and
delivers new state-of-the-art performance for 3D object detection.

Abstract: We propose a novel and general framework to disentangle video data into its
dynamic motion and static content components. Our proposed method is a
self-supervised pipeline with less assumptions and inductive biases than
previous works: it utilizes a transformer-based architecture to jointly
generate flexible implicit features for frame-wise motion and clip-wise
content, and incorporates a low-bitrate vector quantization as an information
bottleneck to promote disentanglement and form a meaningful discrete motion
space. The bitrate-controlled latent motion and content are used as conditional
inputs to a denoising diffusion model to facilitate self-supervised
representation learning. We validate our disentangled representation learning
framework on real-world talking head videos with motion transfer and
auto-regressive motion generation tasks. Furthermore, we also show that our
method can generalize to other types of video data, such as pixel sprites of 2D
cartoon characters. Our work presents a new perspective on self-supervised
learning of disentangled video representations, contributing to the broader
field of video analysis and generation.

Abstract: Vision-based 3D semantic occupancy prediction is a critical task in 3D vision
that integrates volumetric 3D reconstruction with semantic understanding.
Existing methods, however, often rely on modular pipelines. These modules are
typically optimized independently or use pre-configured inputs, leading to
cascading errors. In this paper, we address this limitation by designing a
novel causal loss that enables holistic, end-to-end supervision of the modular
2D-to-3D transformation pipeline. Grounded in the principle of 2D-to-3D
semantic causality, this loss regulates the gradient flow from 3D voxel
representations back to the 2D features. Consequently, it renders the entire
pipeline differentiable, unifying the learning process and making previously
non-trainable components fully learnable. Building on this principle, we
propose the Semantic Causality-Aware 2D-to-3D Transformation, which comprises
three components guided by our causal loss: Channel-Grouped Lifting for
adaptive semantic mapping, Learnable Camera Offsets for enhanced robustness
against camera perturbations, and Normalized Convolution for effective feature
propagation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the Occ3D benchmark, demonstrating significant
robustness to camera perturbations and improved 2D-to-3D semantic consistency.

Motivation: 现实交通监控中，恶劣天气、光线不足或高速运动导致的图像噪声和模糊严重降低了车牌识别准确率，特别是当车牌在图像中占比很小时，需要高效的图像增强预处理。

Method: 提出垂直残差自编码器(VRAE)架构，在每个编码阶段通过辅助块注入输入感知特征来指导表示学习过程，相比传统自编码器能更好地保持通用信息。

Result: 在车牌可见的车辆图像数据集上，VRAE在相同深度下比自编码器PSNR提升约20%，NMSE降低约50%，SSIM提升1%，参数仅增加约1%。

Conclusion: VRAE方法在交通监控图像增强任务中表现优异，显著提升了图像质量指标，为车牌识别系统提供了有效的预处理解决方案。

Abstract: In real-world traffic surveillance, vehicle images captured under adverse
weather, poor lighting, or high-speed motion often suffer from severe noise and
blur. Such degradations significantly reduce the accuracy of license plate
recognition systems, especially when the plate occupies only a small region
within the full vehicle image. Restoring these degraded images a fast realtime
manner is thus a crucial pre-processing step to enhance recognition
performance. In this work, we propose a Vertical Residual Autoencoder (VRAE)
architecture designed for the image enhancement task in traffic surveillance.
The method incorporates an enhancement strategy that employs an auxiliary
block, which injects input-aware features at each encoding stage to guide the
representation learning process, enabling better general information
preservation throughout the network compared to conventional autoencoders.
Experiments on a vehicle image dataset with visible license plates demonstrate
that our method consistently outperforms Autoencoder (AE), Generative
Adversarial Network (GAN), and Flow-Based (FB) approaches. Compared with AE at
the same depth, it improves PSNR by about 20\%, reduces NMSE by around 50\%,
and enhances SSIM by 1\%, while requiring only a marginal increase of roughly
1\% in parameters.

Conclusion: SCFusion有效缓解了传统BEV投影的局限性，为多视角目标检测和跟踪提供了鲁棒且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-View Multi-Object Tracking (MVMOT) is essential for applications such
as surveillance, autonomous driving, and sports analytics. However, maintaining
consistent object identities across multiple cameras remains challenging due to
viewpoint changes, lighting variations, and occlusions, which often lead to
tracking errors.Recent methods project features from multiple cameras into a
unified Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) space to improve robustness against occlusion.
However, this projection introduces feature distortion and non-uniform density
caused by variations in object scale with distance. These issues degrade the
quality of the fused representation and reduce detection and tracking
accuracy.To address these problems, we propose SCFusion, a framework that
combines three techniques to improve multi-view feature integration. First, it
applies a sparse transformation to avoid unnatural interpolation during
projection. Next, it performs density-aware weighting to adaptively fuse
features based on spatial confidence and camera distance. Finally, it
introduces a multi-view consistency loss that encourages each camera to learn
discriminative features independently before fusion.Experiments show that
SCFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching an IDF1 score of 95.9%
on WildTrack and a MODP of 89.2% on MultiviewX, outperforming the baseline
method TrackTacular. These results demonstrate that SCFusion effectively
mitigates the limitations of conventional BEV projection and provides a robust
and accurate solution for multi-view object detection and tracking.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LD-ViCE是一个基于潜在扩散模型的视频反事实解释框架，通过在潜在空间中操作降低计算成本，同时生成真实且可解释的反事实解释，在多个视频数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频AI系统在安全关键领域应用日益广泛，但现有解释技术存在时间连贯性不足、鲁棒性不够、缺乏可操作的因果洞察等问题，需要开发更有效的解释方法。

Method: 使用最先进的扩散模型在潜在空间中操作，通过额外的精炼步骤生成真实且可解释的反事实解释，降低了生成解释的计算成本。

Result: 在三个不同的视频数据集上验证了有效性，R2分数提升高达68%，推理时间减少一半，生成的解释具有语义意义和时间连贯性。

Conclusion: LD-ViCE代表了在安全关键领域可信AI部署的重要进展，为理解视频AI模型行为提供了有价值的洞察。

Abstract: Video-based AI systems are increasingly adopted in safety-critical domains
such as autonomous driving and healthcare. However, interpreting their
decisions remains challenging due to the inherent spatiotemporal complexity of
video data and the opacity of deep learning models. Existing explanation
techniques often suffer from limited temporal coherence, insufficient
robustness, and a lack of actionable causal insights. Current counterfactual
explanation methods typically do not incorporate guidance from the target
model, reducing semantic fidelity and practical utility. We introduce Latent
Diffusion for Video Counterfactual Explanations (LD-ViCE), a novel framework
designed to explain the behavior of video-based AI models. Compared to previous
approaches, LD-ViCE reduces the computational costs of generating explanations
by operating in latent space using a state-of-the-art diffusion model, while
producing realistic and interpretable counterfactuals through an additional
refinement step. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of LD-ViCE
across three diverse video datasets, including EchoNet-Dynamic (cardiac
ultrasound), FERV39k (facial expression), and Something-Something V2 (action
recognition). LD-ViCE outperforms a recent state-of-the-art method, achieving
an increase in R2 score of up to 68% while reducing inference time by half.
Qualitative analysis confirms that LD-ViCE generates semantically meaningful
and temporally coherent explanations, offering valuable insights into the
target model behavior. LD-ViCE represents a valuable step toward the
trustworthy deployment of AI in safety-critical domains.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了HyperTTA框架，通过多退化高光谱数据集、光谱-空间变换分类器和轻量级测试时适配策略，显著提升了高光谱图像分类模型在各种退化条件下的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱图像分类模型对噪声、模糊、压缩和大气效应等现实世界退化引起的分布偏移高度敏感，需要提高模型在多样化退化条件下的鲁棒性。

Method: 1) 构建多退化高光谱数据集模拟9种代表性退化类型；2) 设计光谱-空间变换分类器(SSTC)结合多级感受野机制和标签平滑正则化；3) 提出置信度感知熵最小化LayerNorm适配器(CELA)进行轻量级测试时适配。

Result: 在两个基准数据集上的大量实验表明，HyperTTA在各种退化场景下均优于现有基线方法，验证了其分类主干和TTA方案的有效性。

Conclusion: HyperTTA框架通过系统化的数据集构建、先进的分类器设计和轻量级测试时适配策略，成功解决了高光谱图像分类在退化条件下的鲁棒性问题，为实际应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification models are highly sensitive to
distribution shifts caused by various real-world degradations such as noise,
blur, compression, and atmospheric effects. To address this challenge, we
propose HyperTTA, a unified framework designed to enhance model robustness
under diverse degradation conditions. Specifically, we first construct a
multi-degradation hyperspectral dataset that systematically simulates nine
representative types of degradations, providing a comprehensive benchmark for
robust classification evaluation. Based on this, we design a spectral-spatial
transformer classifier (SSTC) enhanced with a multi-level receptive field
mechanism and label smoothing regularization to jointly capture multi-scale
spatial context and improve generalization. Furthermore, HyperTTA incorporates
a lightweight test-time adaptation (TTA) strategy, the confidence-aware
entropy-minimized LayerNorm adapter (CELA), which updates only the affine
parameters of LayerNorm layers by minimizing prediction entropy on
high-confidence unlabeled target samples. This confidence-aware adaptation
prevents unreliable updates from noisy predictions, enabling robust and dynamic
adaptation without access to source data or target annotations. Extensive
experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that HyperTTA outperforms
existing baselines across a wide range of degradation scenarios, validating the
effectiveness of both its classification backbone and the proposed TTA scheme.
Code will be made available publicly.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确预测个体化的高分辨率直视皮层厚度轨迹对于检测细微的皮层变化和提前干预神经退行性疾病至关重要，但由于大脑皮层的复杂非欧几里形状和多模态数据整合的需求，这一任务很具挑战性。

Method: 提出球面布朗威桥扩散模型(SBDM)，采用双向条件布朗威桥扩散过程来预测注册皮层表面的顶点级CTh轨迹。技术创新包括新的去噪模型条件球面U-Net(CoS-UNet)，结合球面卷积和密集交叉注意力机制来无缝整合皮层表面和表格条件。

Result: 与之前方法相比，SBDM在ADNI和OASIS纵向数据集上实现了显著减少的预测误差。此外，SBDM还能够生成个体的事实和反事实CTh轨迹，为探索皮层发育的假设场景提供了新框架。

Conclusion: SBDM为皮层厚度预测提供了一种有效的解决方案，能够处理复杂的皮层几何形状和多模态数据，不仅预测准确性明显提升，还能支持个体化的事实和反事实分析，为神经退行性疾病的早期识别和干预提供了新的研究工具。

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of individualized, high-resolution cortical thickness
(CTh) trajectories is essential for detecting subtle cortical changes,
providing invaluable insights into neurodegenerative processes and facilitating
earlier and more precise intervention strategies. However, CTh forecasting is a
challenging task due to the intricate non-Euclidean geometry of the cerebral
cortex and the need to integrate multi-modal data for subject-specific
predictions. To address these challenges, we introduce the Spherical Brownian
Bridge Diffusion Model (SBDM). Specifically, we propose a bidirectional
conditional Brownian bridge diffusion process to forecast CTh trajectories at
the vertex level of registered cortical surfaces. Our technical contribution
includes a new denoising model, the conditional spherical U-Net (CoS-UNet),
which combines spherical convolutions and dense cross-attention to integrate
cortical surfaces and tabular conditions seamlessly. Compared to previous
approaches, SBDM achieves significantly reduced prediction errors, as
demonstrated by our experiments based on longitudinal datasets from the ADNI
and OASIS. Additionally, we demonstrate SBDM's ability to generate individual
factual and counterfactual CTh trajectories, offering a novel framework for
exploring hypothetical scenarios of cortical development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Mamba视觉模型主要关注网络架构和扫描路径，而忽视了状态空间模型（SSM）模块本身的潜力。为了探索SSM在视觉任务中的能力，特别是轻量级超分辨率任务。

Method: 在SSM中应用一阶保持条件，推导新的离散化形式，并分析累积误差。通过改进SSM的计算过程来增强令牌相关性，从而提升性能。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上，FSSM显著提升了MambaIR的性能，超越了当前的轻量级超分辨率方法，达到了最先进的水平，且没有增加额外参数。

Conclusion: FSSM通过改进SSM模块的计算过程，有效提升了轻量级超分辨率任务的性能，证明了状态空间模型在视觉任务中的巨大潜力。

Abstract: State space models (SSMs), particularly Mamba, have shown promise in NLP
tasks and are increasingly applied to vision tasks. However, most Mamba-based
vision models focus on network architecture and scan paths, with little
attention to the SSM module. In order to explore the potential of SSMs, we
modified the calculation process of SSM without increasing the number of
parameters to improve the performance on lightweight super-resolution tasks. In
this paper, we introduce the First-order State Space Model (FSSM) to improve
the original Mamba module, enhancing performance by incorporating token
correlations. We apply a first-order hold condition in SSMs, derive the new
discretized form, and analyzed cumulative error. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that FSSM improves the performance of MambaIR on five benchmark
datasets without additionally increasing the number of parameters, and
surpasses current lightweight SR methods, achieving state-of-the-art results.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于多视图互信息理论的自监督学习方法，用于解决不平衡数据集中的对比学习问题，在多个基准数据集上实现了新的SOTA准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对比自监督学习在平衡数据集上表现良好，但在不平衡数据集上泛化能力不足。受Yann LeCun关于多视图框架扩展的启发，需要为不平衡数据集开发更有效的自监督学习方法。

Method: 基于互信息理论提出多视图目标函数，通过区分类内和类间判别特征来提取尾部类的代表性特征，引入新的损失函数过滤极端特征以学习更好的表示。

Result: 在多种自监督框架（对比和非对比）上验证有效，在Cifar10-LT上提升2%（Resnet-18），Cifar100-LT提升5%（Resnet-18），Imagenet-LT提升3%（Resnet-50），达到了新的SOTA准确率。

Conclusion: 多视图目标函数能有效解决自监督学习在不平衡数据集上的问题，通过理论分析和实验验证证明了方法的有效性，为不平衡学习提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: The robustness of contrastive self-supervised learning (CSSL) for imbalanced
datasets is largely unexplored. CSSL usually makes use of \emph{multi-view}
assumptions to learn discriminatory features via similar and dissimilar data
samples. CSSL works well on balanced datasets, but does not generalize well for
imbalanced datasets. In a very recent paper, as part of future work, Yann LeCun
pointed out that the self-supervised multiview framework can be extended to
cases involving \emph{more than two views}. Taking a cue from this insight we
propose a theoretical justification based on the concept of \emph{mutual
information} to support the \emph{more than two views} objective and apply it
to the problem of dataset imbalance in self-supervised learning. The proposed
method helps extract representative characteristics of the tail classes by
segregating between \emph{intra} and \emph{inter} discriminatory
characteristics. We introduce a loss function that helps us to learn better
representations by filtering out extreme features. Experimental evaluation on a
variety of self-supervised frameworks (both contrastive and non-contrastive)
also prove that the \emph{more than two view} objective works well for
imbalanced datasets. We achieve a new state-of-the-art accuracy in
self-supervised imbalanced dataset classification (2\% improvement in
Cifar10-LT using Resnet-18, 5\% improvement in Cifar100-LT using Resnet-18, 3\%
improvement in Imagenet-LT (1k) using Resnet-50).

TL;DR: 提出一个基于单一自然语言指令的统一图像分析流程，整合了开放词汇检测、可提示分割、文本条件修复和视觉语言描述，实现了端到端的图像处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决多步骤图像分析任务中需要多个独立工具的问题，开发一个统一的端到端流程，通过单一提示实现定位、分割、编辑和描述功能。

Method: 构建了一个结合开放词汇检测、可提示分割、文本条件修复和视觉语言描述的统一流水线，支持交互式UI和可编写脚本的CLI，包含阈值调整、掩码检查和资源感知默认值等集成选择。

Result: 在单词语境下，检测和分割在90%以上的情况下产生可用掩码，准确率超过85%。在高性能GPU上，修复占典型设置下总运行时间的60-75%。

Conclusion: 提供了一个透明可靠的模式，将现代视觉和多模态模型组装在单一提示后面，通过明确的防护措施和操作实践提高了对象替换、场景增强和移除的可靠性。

Abstract: Prompt-driven image analysis converts a single natural-language instruction
into multiple steps: locate, segment, edit, and describe. We present a
practical case study of a unified pipeline that combines open-vocabulary
detection, promptable segmentation, text-conditioned inpainting, and
vision-language description into a single workflow. The system works end to end
from a single prompt, retains intermediate artifacts for transparent debugging
(such as detections, masks, overlays, edited images, and before and after
composites), and provides the same functionality through an interactive UI and
a scriptable CLI for consistent, repeatable runs. We highlight integration
choices that reduce brittleness, including threshold adjustments, mask
inspection with light morphology, and resource-aware defaults. In a small,
single-word prompt segment, detection and segmentation produced usable masks in
over 90% of cases with an accuracy above 85% based on our criteria. On a
high-end GPU, inpainting makes up 60 to 75% of total runtime under typical
guidance and sampling settings, which highlights the need for careful tuning.
The study offers implementation-guided advice on thresholds, mask tightness,
and diffusion parameters, and details version pinning, artifact logging, and
seed control to support replay. Our contribution is a transparent, reliable
pattern for assembling modern vision and multimodal models behind a single
prompt, with clear guardrails and operational practices that improve
reliability in object replacement, scene augmentation, and removal.

Motivation: 海底物体检测对海洋研究、潜水机器人和海洋保护至关重要，但现有方法无法完全处理海底环境的复杂性。

Method: 系统分析了海底物体检测的5大挑战领域，评估从传统到现代方法的进展，探索大视觉-语言模型的应用潜力，包括使用DALL-E 3生成合成数据集和微调Florence-2模型。

Result: 识别了三个关键发现：现有UOD方法不足以应对动态海底环境挑战；LVLMs合成数据有潜力但需提高实际性；LVLMs在UOD领域有广阔前景但实时应用研究不足。

Conclusion: 大视觉-语言模型为海底物体检测带来新机遇，但需要进一步研究优化技术以实现实时应用和提高合成数据的实际效果。

Abstract: Underwater object detection (UOD) is vital to diverse marine applications,
including oceanographic research, underwater robotics, and marine conservation.
However, UOD faces numerous challenges that compromise its performance. Over
the years, various methods have been proposed to address these issues, but they
often fail to fully capture the complexities of underwater environments. This
review systematically categorizes UOD challenges into five key areas: Image
quality degradation, target-related issues, data-related challenges,
computational and processing constraints, and limitations in detection
methodologies. To address these challenges, we analyze the progression from
traditional image processing and object detection techniques to modern
approaches. Additionally, we explore the potential of large vision-language
models (LVLMs) in UOD, leveraging their multi-modal capabilities demonstrated
in other domains. We also present case studies, including synthetic dataset
generation using DALL-E 3 and fine-tuning Florence-2 LVLM for UOD. This review
identifies three key insights: (i) Current UOD methods are insufficient to
fully address challenges like image degradation and small object detection in
dynamic underwater environments. (ii) Synthetic data generation using LVLMs
shows potential for augmenting datasets but requires further refinement to
ensure realism and applicability. (iii) LVLMs hold significant promise for UOD,
but their real-time application remains under-explored, requiring further
research on optimization techniques.

Motivation: 开发能够感知视觉时间变化的紧凑视频表征，解决现有视频嵌入表示在时间对称动作识别任务上表现差的问题。

Method: 提出一种自监督学习的适配方法，通过自动编码器模型在固定图像特征序列上注入时间敏感性，并采用受感觉直线化演化的引导偏置。

Result: 在Something-Something、EPIC-Kitchens和Charade数据集上，该方法超过了大规模视频模型的表现，并在结合现有模型时提高了标准分类性能。

Conclusion: 通过注入时间敏感性的紧凑视频表征，可以有效区分时间对称动作，为视频理解任务提供更好的表征学习。

Abstract: Our objective is to develop compact video representations that are sensitive
to visual change over time. To measure such time-sensitivity, we introduce a
new task: chiral action recognition, where one needs to distinguish between a
pair of temporally opposite actions, such as "opening vs. closing a door",
"approaching vs. moving away from something", "folding vs. unfolding paper",
etc. Such actions (i) occur frequently in everyday life, (ii) require
understanding of simple visual change over time (in object state, size, spatial
position, count . . . ), and (iii) are known to be poorly represented by many
video embeddings. Our goal is to build time aware video representations which
offer linear separability between these chiral pairs. To that end, we propose a
self-supervised adaptation recipe to inject time-sensitivity into a sequence of
frozen image features. Our model is based on an auto-encoder with a latent
space with inductive bias inspired by perceptual straightening. We show that
this results in a compact but time-sensitive video representation for the
proposed task across three datasets: Something-Something, EPIC-Kitchens, and
Charade. Our method (i) outperforms much larger video models pre-trained on
large-scale video datasets, and (ii) leads to an improvement in classification
performance on standard benchmarks when combined with these existing models.

Motivation: 现有的人类中心视频生成方法难以有效协调文本、图像和音频等异构模态，主要面临两个挑战：配对三元组训练数据稀缺，以及主体保持和音视频同步子任务难以与多模态输入协作。

Method: 1) 构建高质量配对多模态数据集；2) 采用两阶段渐进式训练范式：第一阶段使用最小侵入式图像注入策略保持主体，第二阶段通过焦点预测策略和音频交叉注意力层实现音视频同步；3) 推理时使用时间自适应无分类器引导策略。

Result: 大量实验结果表明，HuMo在各项子任务上超越了专门的先进方法，建立了统一的多模态条件人类视频生成框架。

Conclusion: HuMo通过创新的数据集构建、训练策略和推理方法，成功解决了多模态人类视频生成的协调问题，为协作式多模态控制提供了有效的统一框架。

Abstract: Human-Centric Video Generation (HCVG) methods seek to synthesize human videos
from multimodal inputs, including text, image, and audio. Existing methods
struggle to effectively coordinate these heterogeneous modalities due to two
challenges: the scarcity of training data with paired triplet conditions and
the difficulty of collaborating the sub-tasks of subject preservation and
audio-visual sync with multimodal inputs. In this work, we present HuMo, a
unified HCVG framework for collaborative multimodal control. For the first
challenge, we construct a high-quality dataset with diverse and paired text,
reference images, and audio. For the second challenge, we propose a two-stage
progressive multimodal training paradigm with task-specific strategies. For the
subject preservation task, to maintain the prompt following and visual
generation abilities of the foundation model, we adopt the minimal-invasive
image injection strategy. For the audio-visual sync task, besides the commonly
adopted audio cross-attention layer, we propose a focus-by-predicting strategy
that implicitly guides the model to associate audio with facial regions. For
joint learning of controllabilities across multimodal inputs, building on
previously acquired capabilities, we progressively incorporate the audio-visual
sync task. During inference, for flexible and fine-grained multimodal control,
we design a time-adaptive Classifier-Free Guidance strategy that dynamically
adjusts guidance weights across denoising steps. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that HuMo surpasses specialized state-of-the-art methods in
sub-tasks, establishing a unified framework for collaborative
multimodal-conditioned HCVG. Project Page:

Result: LVMs在识别基本对象和特征方面表现优异，但在处理精细细节或对齐涉及多个主体的多个动作时，幻觉敏感性显著增加

Conclusion: MESH提供了一个有效且全面的方法来识别视频中的幻觉，揭示了LVMs在复杂场景理解方面的局限性

Abstract: Large Video Models (LVMs) build on the semantic capabilities of Large
Language Models (LLMs) and vision modules by integrating temporal information
to better understand dynamic video content. Despite their progress, LVMs are
prone to hallucinations-producing inaccurate or irrelevant descriptions.
Current benchmarks for video hallucination depend heavily on manual
categorization of video content, neglecting the perception-based processes
through which humans naturally interpret videos. We introduce MESH, a benchmark
designed to evaluate hallucinations in LVMs systematically. MESH uses a
Question-Answering framework with binary and multi-choice formats incorporating
target and trap instances. It follows a bottom-up approach, evaluating basic
objects, coarse-to-fine subject features, and subject-action pairs, aligning
with human video understanding. We demonstrate that MESH offers an effective
and comprehensive approach for identifying hallucinations in videos. Our
evaluations show that while LVMs excel at recognizing basic objects and
features, their susceptibility to hallucinations increases markedly when
handling fine details or aligning multiple actions involving various subjects
in longer videos.

Method: 使用多视角数据集，通过随机选择24个视角（选择向量）学习视角不变嵌入，并尝试使用所有5个高度级别的120个视角（选择矩阵）进行随机选择

Result: ViewSparsifier方法在植物年龄预测和叶片计数估计两个任务中均获得优胜

Conclusion: 多视角分析方法能有效提升植物表型分析的准确性，随机视角选择策略是未来研究的有价值方向

Abstract: Plant phenotyping involves analyzing observable characteristics of plants to
better understand their growth, health, and development. In the context of deep
learning, this analysis is often approached through single-view classification
or regression models. However, these methods often fail to capture all
information required for accurate estimation of target phenotypic traits, which
can adversely affect plant health assessment and harvest readiness prediction.
To address this, the Growth Modelling (GroMo) Grand Challenge at ACM Multimedia
2025 provides a multi-view dataset featuring multiple plants and two tasks:
Plant Age Prediction and Leaf Count Estimation. Each plant is photographed from
multiple heights and angles, leading to significant overlap and redundancy in
the captured information. To learn view-invariant embeddings, we incorporate 24
views, referred to as the selection vector, in a random selection. Our
ViewSparsifier approach won both tasks. For further improvement and as a
direction for future research, we also experimented with randomized view
selection across all five height levels (120 views total), referred to as
selection matrices.

Abstract: Multimodal models have achieved remarkable success in natural image
segmentation, yet they often underperform when applied to the medical domain.
Through extensive study, we attribute this performance gap to the challenges of
multimodal fusion, primarily the significant semantic gap between abstract
textual prompts and fine-grained medical visual features, as well as the
resulting feature dispersion. To address these issues, we revisit the problem
from the perspective of semantic aggregation. Specifically, we propose an
Expectation-Maximization (EM) Aggregation mechanism and a Text-Guided Pixel
Decoder. The former mitigates feature dispersion by dynamically clustering
features into compact semantic centers to enhance cross-modal correspondence.
The latter is designed to bridge the semantic gap by leveraging
domain-invariant textual knowledge to effectively guide deep visual
representations. The synergy between these two mechanisms significantly
improves the model's generalization ability. Extensive experiments on public
cardiac and fundus datasets demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms existing SOTA approaches across multiple domain generalization
benchmarks.

Conclusion: GraphTopoNet展示了图机器学习如何将稀疏、不确定的地球物理观测转化为大陆尺度的可操作知识，提高了操作建模的可靠性

Abstract: Accurate maps of Greenland's subglacial bed are essential for sea-level
projections, but radar observations are sparse and uneven. We introduce
GraphTopoNet, a graph-learning framework that fuses heterogeneous supervision
and explicitly models uncertainty via Monte Carlo dropout. Spatial graphs built
from surface observables (elevation, velocity, mass balance) are augmented with
gradient features and polynomial trends to capture both local variability and
broad structure. To handle data gaps, we employ a hybrid loss that combines
confidence-weighted radar supervision with dynamically balanced regularization.
Applied to three Greenland subregions, GraphTopoNet outperforms interpolation,
convolutional, and graph-based baselines, reducing error by up to 60 percent

reliability for operational modeling, supporting agencies engaged in climate

Abstract: The objective of this paper is to significantly reduce the manual workload
required from medical professionals in complex 3D segmentation tasks that
cannot be yet fully automated. For instance, in radiotherapy planning, organs
at risk must be accurately identified in computed tomography (CT) or magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) scans to ensure they are spared from harmful radiation.
Similarly, diagnosing age-related degenerative diseases such as sarcopenia,
which involve progressive muscle volume loss and strength, is commonly based on
muscular mass measurements often obtained from manual segmentation of medical
volumes. To alleviate the manual-segmentation burden, this paper introduces an
implicit shape prior to segment volumes from sparse slice manual annotations
generalized to the multi-organ case, along with a simple framework for
automatically selecting the most informative slices to guide and minimize the
next interactions. The experimental validation shows the method's effectiveness
on two medical use cases: assisted segmentation in the context of at risks
organs for brain cancer patients, and acceleration of the creation of a new
database with unseen muscle shapes for patients with sarcopenia.

Abstract: With imaging devices delivering ever-higher resolutions and the emerging
diffusion-based forgery methods, current detectors trained only on traditional
datasets (with splicing, copy-moving and object removal forgeries) lack
exposure to this new manipulation type. To address this, we propose a novel
high-resolution SIF dataset of 1200+ diffusion-generated manipulations with
semantically extracted masks. However, this also imposes a challenge on
existing methods, as they face significant computational resource constraints
due to their prohibitive computational complexities. Therefore, we propose a
novel EfficientIML model with a lightweight, three-stage EfficientRWKV
backbone. EfficientRWKV's hybrid state-space and attention network captures
global context and local details in parallel, while a multi-scale supervision
strategy enforces consistency across hierarchical predictions. Extensive
evaluations on our dataset and standard benchmarks demonstrate that our
approach outperforms ViT-based and other SOTA lightweight baselines in
localization performance, FLOPs and inference speed, underscoring its
suitability for real-time forensic applications.

Abstract: Recent advancements in foundation models, such as the Segment Anything Model
(SAM), have significantly impacted medical image segmentation, especially in
retinal imaging, where precise segmentation is vital for diagnosis. Despite
this progress, current methods face critical challenges: 1) modality ambiguity
in textual disease descriptions, 2) a continued reliance on manual prompting
for SAM-based workflows, and 3) a lack of a unified framework, with most
methods being modality- and task-specific. To overcome these hurdles, we
propose CLIP-unified Auto-Prompt Segmentation (\CLAPS), a novel method for
unified segmentation across diverse tasks and modalities in retinal imaging.
Our approach begins by pre-training a CLIP-based image encoder on a large,
multi-modal retinal dataset to handle data scarcity and distribution imbalance.
We then leverage GroundingDINO to automatically generate spatial bounding box
prompts by detecting local lesions. To unify tasks and resolve ambiguity, we
use text prompts enhanced with a unique "modality signature" for each imaging
modality. Ultimately, these automated textual and spatial prompts guide SAM to
execute precise segmentation, creating a fully automated and unified pipeline.
Extensive experiments on 12 diverse datasets across 11 critical segmentation
categories show that CLAPS achieves performance on par with specialized expert
models while surpassing existing benchmarks across most metrics, demonstrating
its broad generalizability as a foundation model.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have taken a great step towards AGI. Meanwhile,
an increasing number of domain-specific problems such as math and programming
boost these general-purpose models to continuously evolve via learning deeper
expertise. Now is thus the time further to extend the diversity of specialized
applications for knowledgeable LLMs, though collecting high quality data with
unexpected and informative tasks is challenging. In this paper, we propose to
use advertisement (ad) videos as a challenging test-bed to probe the ability of
LLMs in perceiving beyond the objective physical content of common visual
domain. Our motivation is to take full advantage of the clue-rich and
information-dense ad videos' traits, e.g., marketing logic, persuasive
strategies, and audience engagement. Our contribution is three-fold: (1) To our
knowledge, this is the first attempt to use ad videos with well-designed tasks
to evaluate LLMs. We contribute AdsQA, a challenging ad Video QA benchmark
derived from 1,544 ad videos with 10,962 clips, totaling 22.7 hours, providing
5 challenging tasks. (2) We propose ReAd-R, a Deepseek-R1 styled RL model that
reflects on questions, and generates answers via reward-driven optimization.
(3) We benchmark 14 top-tier LLMs on AdsQA, and our \texttt{ReAd-R}~achieves
the state-of-the-art outperforming strong competitors equipped with long-chain
reasoning capabilities by a clear margin.

Abstract: Significant advancements in AI-driven multimodal medical image diagnosis have
led to substantial improvements in ophthalmic disease identification in recent
years. However, acquiring paired multimodal ophthalmic images remains
prohibitively expensive. While fundus photography is simple and cost-effective,
the limited availability of OCT data and inherent modality imbalance hinder
further progress. Conventional approaches that rely solely on fundus or textual
features often fail to capture fine-grained spatial information, as each
imaging modality provides distinct cues about lesion predilection sites. In
this study, we propose a novel unpaired multimodal framework \UOPSL that
utilizes extensive OCT-derived spatial priors to dynamically identify
predilection sites, enhancing fundus image-based disease recognition. Our
approach bridges unpaired fundus and OCTs via extended disease text
descriptions. Initially, we employ contrastive learning on a large corpus of
unpaired OCT and fundus images while simultaneously learning the predilection
sites matrix in the OCT latent space. Through extensive optimization, this
matrix captures lesion localization patterns within the OCT feature space.
During the fine-tuning or inference phase of the downstream classification task
based solely on fundus images, where paired OCT data is unavailable, we
eliminate OCT input and utilize the predilection sites matrix to assist in
fundus image classification learning. Extensive experiments conducted on 9
diverse datasets across 28 critical categories demonstrate that our framework
outperforms existing benchmarks.

Motivation: 解决扩散模型在数据稀缺领域面临的挑战，避免需要大量重新训练或昂贵配对数据的需求。

Method: 通过在共享潜在空间中对齐源域和目标域分布，将预训练的源域扩散模型与目标域潜在对齐扩散模型（LADM）集成，利用部分配对的潜在表示进行训练。

Conclusion: LADB为现实世界域转换提供了一个可扩展且通用的解决方案，特别适用于数据标注成本高或不完整的场景。

Abstract: Diffusion models excel at generating high-quality outputs but face challenges
in data-scarce domains, where exhaustive retraining or costly paired data are
often required. To address these limitations, we propose Latent Aligned
Diffusion Bridges (LADB), a semi-supervised framework for sample-to-sample
translation that effectively bridges domain gaps using partially paired data.
By aligning source and target distributions within a shared latent space, LADB
seamlessly integrates pretrained source-domain diffusion models with a
target-domain Latent Aligned Diffusion Model (LADM), trained on partially
paired latent representations. This approach enables deterministic domain
mapping without the need for full supervision. Compared to unpaired methods,
which often lack controllability, and fully paired approaches that require
large, domain-specific datasets, LADB strikes a balance between fidelity and
diversity by leveraging a mixture of paired and unpaired latent-target
couplings. Our experimental results demonstrate superior performance in
depth-to-image translation under partial supervision. Furthermore, we extend
LADB to handle multi-source translation (from depth maps and segmentation
masks) and multi-target translation in a class-conditioned style transfer task,
showcasing its versatility in handling diverse and heterogeneous use cases.
Ultimately, we present LADB as a scalable and versatile solution for real-world
domain translation, particularly in scenarios where data annotation is costly
or incomplete.

Conclusion: 双参考系双流架构能有效解耦手势形态和轨迹信息，为解决手语识别中的几何歧义问题提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Isolated Sign Language Recognition (ISLR) is challenged by gestures that are
morphologically similar yet semantically distinct, a problem rooted in the
complex interplay between hand shape and motion trajectory. Existing methods,
often relying on a single reference frame, struggle to resolve this geometric
ambiguity. This paper introduces Dual-SignLanguageNet (DSLNet), a
dual-reference, dual-stream architecture that decouples and models gesture
morphology and trajectory in separate, complementary coordinate systems. Our
approach utilizes a wrist-centric frame for view-invariant shape analysis and a
facial-centric frame for context-aware trajectory modeling. These streams are
processed by specialized networks-a topology-aware graph convolution for shape
and a Finsler geometry-based encoder for trajectory-and are integrated via a
geometry-driven optimal transport fusion mechanism. DSLNet sets a new
state-of-the-art, achieving 93.70%, 89.97% and 99.79% accuracy on the
challenging WLASL-100, WLASL-300 and LSA64 datasets, respectively, with
significantly fewer parameters than competing models.

Conclusion: FractalPINN-Flow提供了一个有效的无监督光流估计框架，通过分形网络结构和变分正则化，在无需真实标注的情况下实现了高质量的光流估计性能。

Abstract: We present FractalPINN-Flow, an unsupervised deep learning framework for
dense optical flow estimation that learns directly from consecutive grayscale
frames without requiring ground truth. The architecture centers on the Fractal
Deformation Network (FDN) - a recursive encoder-decoder inspired by fractal
geometry and self-similarity. Unlike traditional CNNs with sequential
downsampling, FDN uses repeated encoder-decoder nesting with skip connections
to capture both fine-grained details and long-range motion patterns. The
training objective is based on a classical variational formulation using total
variation (TV) regularization. Specifically, we minimize an energy functional
that combines $L^1$ and $L^2$ data fidelity terms to enforce brightness
constancy, along with a TV term that promotes spatial smoothness and coherent
flow fields. Experiments on synthetic and benchmark datasets show that
FractalPINN-Flow produces accurate, smooth, and edge-preserving optical flow
fields. The model is especially effective for high-resolution data and
scenarios with limited annotations.

Abstract: Coastal water segmentation from satellite imagery presents unique challenges
due to complex spectral characteristics and irregular boundary patterns.
Traditional RGB-based approaches often suffer from training instability and
poor generalization in diverse maritime environments. This paper introduces a
systematic robust enhancement framework, referred to as Robust U-Net, that
leverages HSV color space supervision and multi-modal constraints for improved

control. Through comprehensive ablation studies, we demonstrate that HSV
supervision provides the highest impact (0.85 influence score), while the
complete framework achieves superior training stability (84\% variance
reduction) and enhanced segmentation quality. Our method shows consistent
improvements across multiple evaluation metrics while maintaining computational
efficiency. For reproducibility, our training configurations and code are

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive survey of computational imaging (CI)
techniques and their transformative impact on computer vision (CV)
applications. Conventional imaging methods often fail to deliver high-fidelity
visual data in challenging conditions, such as low light, motion blur, or high
dynamic range scenes, thereby limiting the performance of state-of-the-art CV
systems. Computational imaging techniques, including light field imaging, high
dynamic range (HDR) imaging, deblurring, high-speed imaging, and glare
mitigation, address these limitations by enhancing image acquisition and
reconstruction processes. This survey systematically explores the synergies
between CI techniques and core CV tasks, including object detection, depth
estimation, optical flow, face recognition, and keypoint detection. By
analyzing the relationships between CI methods and their practical
contributions to CV applications, this work highlights emerging opportunities,
challenges, and future research directions. We emphasize the potential for
task-specific, adaptive imaging pipelines that improve robustness, accuracy,

surveillance, augmented reality, and robotics.

Abstract: As multimodal large language models (MLLMs) advance, their large-scale
architectures pose challenges for deployment in resource-constrained
environments. In the age of large models, where energy efficiency,
computational scalability and environmental sustainability are paramount, the
development of lightweight and high-performance models is critical for
real-world applications. As such, we propose a lightweight MLLM framework for
end-to-end visual question answering. Our proposed approach centres on
BreezeCLIP, a compact yet powerful vision-language encoder optimised for
efficient multimodal understanding. With only 1.2 billion parameters overall,
our model significantly reduces computational cost while achieving performance
comparable to standard-size MLLMs. Experiments conducted on multiple datasets
further validate its effectiveness in balancing accuracy and efficiency. The
modular and extensible design enables generalisation to broader multimodal
tasks. The proposed lightweight vision-language framework is denoted as BcQLM
(BreezeCLIP-enhanced Q-Gated Multimodal Language Model). It offers a promising
path toward deployable MLLMs under practical hardware constraints. The source
code is available at https://github.com/thico0224/BcQLM.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel method for end-to-end crowd detection that
leverages object density information to enhance existing transformer-based
detectors. We present CrowdQuery (CQ), whose core component is our CQ module
that predicts and subsequently embeds an object density map. The embedded
density information is then systematically integrated into the decoder.
Existing density map definitions typically depend on head positions or
object-based spatial statistics. Our method extends these definitions to
include individual bounding box dimensions. By incorporating density
information into object queries, our method utilizes density-guided queries to
improve detection in crowded scenes. CQ is universally applicable to both 2D
and 3D detection without requiring additional data. Consequently, we are the
first to design a method that effectively bridges 2D and 3D detection in
crowded environments. We demonstrate the integration of CQ into both a general
2D and 3D transformer-based object detector, introducing the architectures CQ2D
and CQ3D. CQ is not limited to the specific transformer models we selected.
Experiments on the STCrowd dataset for both 2D and 3D domains show significant
performance improvements compared to the base models, outperforming most
state-of-the-art methods. When integrated into a state-of-the-art crowd
detector, CQ can further improve performance on the challenging CrowdHuman
dataset, demonstrating its generalizability. The code is released at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ArgoTweak是首个提供真实地图先验、当前地图和传感器数据三元组的公开数据集，通过双射映射框架实现细粒度地图元素级修改，显著减少了合成先验带来的sim2real差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有公开数据集缺乏地图先验、当前地图和传感器数据的三元组，导致方法只能依赖合成先验，产生不一致性和显著的sim2real差距。

Method: 采用双射映射框架，将大规模修改分解为地图元素级的细粒度原子变化，确保可解释性，实现精确的变化检测和集成。

Result: 实验表明，在ArgoTweak上训练的模型相比合成先验显著减少了sim2real差距，广泛的消融研究进一步验证了结构化先验和详细变化标注的影响。

Conclusion: ArgoTweak为可解释的先验辅助高精地图建立了基准，推动了可扩展、自我改进的制图解决方案发展。

Abstract: Reliable integration of prior information is crucial for self-verifying and
self-updating HD maps. However, no public dataset includes the required triplet
of prior maps, current maps, and sensor data. As a result, existing methods
must rely on synthetic priors, which create inconsistencies and lead to a
significant sim2real gap. To address this, we introduce ArgoTweak, the first
dataset to complete the triplet with realistic map priors. At its core,
ArgoTweak employs a bijective mapping framework, breaking down large-scale
modifications into fine-grained atomic changes at the map element level, thus
ensuring interpretability. This paradigm shift enables accurate change
detection and integration while preserving unchanged elements with high
fidelity. Experiments show that training models on ArgoTweak significantly
reduces the sim2real gap compared to synthetic priors. Extensive ablations
further highlight the impact of structured priors and detailed change
annotations. By establishing a benchmark for explainable, prior-aided HD
mapping, ArgoTweak advances scalable, self-improving mapping solutions. The
dataset, baselines, map modification toolbox, and further resources are
available at https://kth-rpl.github.io/ArgoTweak/.

Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在评估文本到图像生成系统时存在偏见、过度自信和跨域性能不一致的问题，标准提示集成方法在多模态任务中效果不佳

Method: Multimodal Mixture-of-Bayesian Prompt Ensembles (MMB)，结合贝叶斯提示集成和图像聚类，根据图像视觉特征动态分配提示权重

Result: 在HPSv2和MJBench基准测试中，MMB在配对偏好判断准确性和校准方面优于现有基线，与人类标注更一致

Conclusion: 多模态特定的校准策略对于可靠的大规模文本到图像评估至关重要，MMB为这一方向提供了有前景的解决方案

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are increasingly used to evaluate
text-to-image (TTI) generation systems, providing automated judgments based on
visual and textual context. However, these "judge" models often suffer from
biases, overconfidence, and inconsistent performance across diverse image
domains. While prompt ensembling has shown promise for mitigating these issues
in unimodal, text-only settings, our experiments reveal that standard
ensembling methods fail to generalize effectively for TTI tasks. To address
these limitations, we propose a new multimodal-aware method called Multimodal
Mixture-of-Bayesian Prompt Ensembles (MMB). Our method uses a Bayesian prompt
ensemble approach augmented by image clustering, allowing the judge to
dynamically assign prompt weights based on the visual characteristics of each
sample. We show that MMB improves accuracy in pairwise preference judgments and
greatly enhances calibration, making it easier to gauge the judge's true
uncertainty. In evaluations on two TTI benchmarks, HPSv2 and MJBench, MMB
outperforms existing baselines in alignment with human annotations and
calibration across varied image content. Our findings highlight the importance
of multimodal-specific strategies for judge calibration and suggest a promising
path forward for reliable large-scale TTI evaluation.

Motivation: 碳中毒症在南亚和东南亚是严重公共健康问题，早期皮肤表现容易欠诊，特别是在农村地区缺乏皮肤科医生。需要自动化图像诊断方案来支持早期发现和及时干预。

Method: 构建了包含20个类别、超11000张图像的数据集，对比评测了CNN和Transformer等深度学习模型。集成LIME和Grad-CAM提供模型可解释性，并开发了网页基础的诊断工具。

Result: Transformer模型表现显著超过CNN，Swin Transformer达到最佳结果（准确率86%）。可解释性可视化确认模型关注了病变相关区域，外部验证表明模型具备良好的演续性。

Conclusion: 该框架证明了深度学习在碳中毒症非侵入式、可访问和可解释诊断中的潜力。可作为农村和资源有限社区的实用诊断帮助工具，支持早期发现和及时干预。

Abstract: Background: Arsenicosis is a serious public health concern in South and
Southeast Asia, primarily caused by long-term consumption of
arsenic-contaminated water. Its early cutaneous manifestations are clinically
significant but often underdiagnosed, particularly in rural areas with limited
access to dermatologists. Automated, image-based diagnostic solutions can
support early detection and timely interventions.
  Methods: In this study, we propose an end-to-end framework for arsenicosis
diagnosis using mobile phone-captured skin images. A dataset comprising 20
classes and over 11000 images of arsenic-induced and other dermatological
conditions was curated. Multiple deep learning architectures, including
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformer-based models, were
benchmarked for arsenicosis detection. Model interpretability was integrated
via LIME and Grad-CAM, while deployment feasibility was demonstrated through a
web-based diagnostic tool.
  Results: Transformer-based models significantly outperformed CNNs, with the
Swin Transformer achieving the best results (86\\% accuracy). LIME and Grad-CAM
visualizations confirmed that the models attended to lesion-relevant regions,
increasing clinical transparency and aiding in error analysis. The framework
also demonstrated strong performance on external validation samples, confirming
its ability to generalize beyond the curated dataset.
  Conclusion: The proposed framework demonstrates the potential of deep
learning for non-invasive, accessible, and explainable diagnosis of arsenicosis
from mobile-acquired images. By enabling reliable image-based screening, it can
serve as a practical diagnostic aid in rural and resource-limited communities,
where access to dermatologists is scarce, thereby supporting early detection
and timely intervention.

Conclusion: 事件相机在低成本、低延迟星迹踪中具有应用潜力，结合其高动态范围、低能耗等优势

Abstract: Event-based cameras (EBCs) are a promising new technology for star
tracking-based attitude determination, but prior studies have struggled to
determine accurate ground truth for real data. We analyze the accuracy of an
EBC star tracking system utilizing the Earth's motion as the ground truth for
comparison. The Earth rotates in a regular way with very small irregularities
which are measured to the level of milli-arcseconds. By keeping an event camera
static and pointing it through a ground-based telescope at the night sky, we
create a system where the only camera motion in the celestial reference frame
is that induced by the Earth's rotation. The resulting event stream is
processed to generate estimates of orientation which we compare to the
International Earth Rotation and Reference System (IERS) measured orientation
of the Earth. The event camera system is able to achieve a root mean squared
across error of 18.47 arcseconds and an about error of 78.84 arcseconds.
Combined with the other benefits of event cameras over framing sensors (reduced
computation due to sparser data streams, higher dynamic range, lower energy
consumption, faster update rates), this level of accuracy suggests the utility
of event cameras for low-cost and low-latency star tracking. We provide all
code and data used to generate our results:

TL;DR: BEAMER提出了一种新的密集图像匹配方法，通过在每个尺度为每个源位置预测多个对应假设，而不是单一假设，显著提高了在深度不连续和强缩放情况下的匹配鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有密集匹配方法在每个尺度为每个源位置只产生单一对应假设，在深度不连续或目标图像是源图像强缩放等挑战性情况下容易产生错误匹配。

Method: 采用beam search策略在每个尺度传播多个假设，并将这些多假设集成到交叉注意力层中，构建BEAMER架构来学习和传播多假设。

Result: BEAMER相比最先进方法显著更鲁棒，特别是在深度不连续和目标图像是源图像强缩放的情况下表现优异。

Conclusion: 预测和传播多个对应假设而非单一假设是提高密集图像匹配鲁棒性的有效策略，BEAMER架构成功实现了这一理念。

Abstract: Dense image matching aims to find a correspondent for every pixel of a source
image in a partially overlapping target image. State-of-the-art methods
typically rely on a coarse-to-fine mechanism where a single correspondent
hypothesis is produced per source location at each scale. In challenging cases
-- such as at depth discontinuities or when the target image is a strong
zoom-in of the source image -- the correspondents of neighboring source
locations are often widely spread and predicting a single correspondent
hypothesis per source location at each scale may lead to erroneous matches. In
this paper, we investigate the idea of predicting multiple correspondent
hypotheses per source location at each scale instead. We consider a beam search
strategy to propagat multiple hypotheses at each scale and propose integrating
these multiple hypotheses into cross-attention layers, resulting in a novel
dense matching architecture called BEAMER. BEAMER learns to preserve and
propagate multiple hypotheses across scales, making it significantly more
robust than state-of-the-art methods, especially at depth discontinuities or
when the target image is a strong zoom-in of the source image.

Conclusion: GeneVA数据集能够支持和促进关键应用，如模型性能基准测试和生成视频质量改进，填补了视频生成评估领域的空白。

Abstract: Recent advances in probabilistic generative models have extended capabilities
from static image synthesis to text-driven video generation. However, the
inherent randomness of their generation process can lead to unpredictable
artifacts, such as impossible physics and temporal inconsistency. Progress in
addressing these challenges requires systematic benchmarks, yet existing
datasets primarily focus on generative images due to the unique spatio-temporal
complexities of videos. To bridge this gap, we introduce GeneVA, a large-scale
artifact dataset with rich human annotations that focuses on spatio-temporal
artifacts in videos generated from natural text prompts. We hope GeneVA can
enable and assist critical applications, such as benchmarking model performance
and improving generative video quality.

TL;DR: RewardDance是一个可扩展的视觉生成奖励建模框架，通过生成式奖励范式解决现有方法的局限性，支持模型规模扩展到260亿参数，并有效解决了奖励黑客问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有奖励模型在视觉生成中存在架构限制和模态约束，Bradley-Terry损失与视觉语言模型的next-token预测机制不匹配，且RLHF优化过程存在奖励黑客问题，阻碍了有效扩展。

Method: RewardDance采用生成式奖励范式，将奖励分数重新定义为模型预测"yes"标记的概率，表示生成图像在特定标准下优于参考图像，从而与VLM架构内在对齐。支持模型规模扩展和上下文扩展（任务指令、参考示例和思维链推理）。

Result: 实验表明RewardDance在文本到图像、文本到视频和图像到视频生成中显著优于最先进方法。大规模奖励模型在RL微调期间保持高奖励方差，证明其抗黑客攻击能力并能产生多样化高质量输出，缓解了模式崩溃问题。

Conclusion: RewardDance通过创新的生成式奖励范式成功解决了视觉生成奖励模型的扩展难题，实现了模型规模和上下文能力的双重扩展，并有效克服了奖励黑客问题，为视觉生成模型的强化学习优化提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Reward Models (RMs) are critical for improving generation models via
Reinforcement Learning (RL), yet the RM scaling paradigm in visual generation
remains largely unexplored. It primarily due to fundamental limitations in
existing approaches: CLIP-based RMs suffer from architectural and input
modality constraints, while prevalent Bradley-Terry losses are fundamentally
misaligned with the next-token prediction mechanism of Vision-Language Models
(VLMs), hindering effective scaling. More critically, the RLHF optimization
process is plagued by Reward Hacking issue, where models exploit flaws in the
reward signal without improving true quality. To address these challenges, we
introduce RewardDance, a scalable reward modeling framework that overcomes
these barriers through a novel generative reward paradigm. By reformulating the
reward score as the model's probability of predicting a "yes" token, indicating
that the generated image outperforms a reference image according to specific
criteria, RewardDance intrinsically aligns reward objectives with VLM
architectures. This alignment unlocks scaling across two dimensions: (1) Model
Scaling: Systematic scaling of RMs up to 26 billion parameters; (2) Context
Scaling: Integration of task-specific instructions, reference examples, and
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
RewardDance significantly surpasses state-of-the-art methods in text-to-image,
text-to-video, and image-to-video generation. Crucially, we resolve the
persistent challenge of "reward hacking": Our large-scale RMs exhibit and
maintain high reward variance during RL fine-tuning, proving their resistance
to hacking and ability to produce diverse, high-quality outputs. It greatly
relieves the mode collapse problem that plagues smaller models.

Abstract: The reconstruction of three-dimensional dynamic scenes is a well-established
yet challenging task within the domain of computer vision. In this paper, we
propose a novel approach that combines the domains of 3D geometry
reconstruction and appearance estimation for physically based rendering and
present a system that is able to perform both tasks for fabrics, utilizing only
a single monocular RGB video sequence as input. In order to obtain realistic
and high-quality deformations and renderings, a physical simulation of the
cloth geometry and differentiable rendering are employed. In this paper, we
introduce two novel regularization terms for the 3D reconstruction task that
improve the plausibility of the reconstruction by addressing the depth
ambiguity problem in monocular video. In comparison with the most recent
methods in the field, we have reduced the error in the 3D reconstruction by a
factor of 2.64 while requiring a medium runtime of 30 min per scene.
Furthermore, the optimized motion achieves sufficient quality to perform an
appearance estimation of the deforming object, recovering sharp details from
this single monocular RGB video.

Abstract: PySensors is a Python package for selecting and placing a sparse set of
sensors for reconstruction and classification tasks. In this major update to
\texttt{PySensors}, we introduce spatially constrained sensor placement
capabilities, allowing users to enforce constraints such as maximum or exact
sensor counts in specific regions, incorporate predetermined sensor locations,
and maintain minimum distances between sensors. We extend functionality to
support custom basis inputs, enabling integration of any data-driven or
spectral basis. We also propose a thermodynamic approach that goes beyond a
single ``optimal'' sensor configuration and maps the complete landscape of
sensor interactions induced by the training data. This comprehensive view
facilitates integration with external selection criteria and enables assessment
of sensor replacement impacts. The new optimization technique also accounts for
over- and under-sampling of sensors, utilizing a regularized least squares
approach for robust reconstruction. Additionally, we incorporate noise-induced
uncertainty quantification of the estimation error and provide visual
uncertainty heat maps to guide deployment decisions. To highlight these
additions, we provide a brief description of the mathematical algorithms and
theory underlying these new capabilities. We demonstrate the usage of new
features with illustrative code examples and include practical advice for
implementation across various application domains. Finally, we outline a
roadmap of potential extensions to further enhance the package's functionality

Abstract: Obstacle avoidance is a critical component of the navigation stack required
for mobile robots to operate effectively in complex and unknown environments.
In this research, three end-to-end Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) were
trained and evaluated offline and deployed on a differential-drive mobile robot
for real-time obstacle avoidance to generate low-level steering commands from
synchronized color and depth images acquired by an Intel RealSense D415 RGB-D
camera in diverse environments. Offline evaluation showed that the NetConEmb
model achieved the best performance with a notably low MedAE of $0.58 \times
10^{-3}$ rad/s. In comparison, the lighter NetEmb architecture adopted in this
study, which reduces the number of trainable parameters by approximately 25\%
and converges faster, produced comparable results with an RMSE of $21.68 \times
10^{-3}$ rad/s, close to the $21.42 \times 10^{-3}$ rad/s obtained by

Abstract: This paper proposes a framework for multi-robot systems to perform

limitations of Gaussian Process (GP) regression, we employ Random Feature GP
(RFGP) and its online variant (O-RFGP) that enables online and incremental
inference. By integrating these with Voronoi-based coverage control and Upper
Confidence Bound (UCB) sampling strategy, a team of robots can adaptively focus
on important regions while refining the learned spatial field for efficient
coverage. Under mild assumptions, we provide theoretical guarantees and
evaluate the framework through simulations in time-invariant scenarios.
Furthermore, its effectiveness in time-varying settings is demonstrated through
additional simulations and a physical experiment.

Abstract: Enabling robots to grasp objects specified through natural language is
essential for effective human-robot interaction, yet it remains a significant
challenge. Existing approaches often struggle with open-form language
expressions and typically assume unambiguous target objects without duplicates.
Moreover, they frequently rely on costly, dense pixel-wise annotations for both
object grounding and grasp configuration. We present Attribute-based Object
Grounding and Robotic Grasping (OGRG), a novel framework that interprets
open-form language expressions and performs spatial reasoning to ground target
objects and predict planar grasp poses, even in scenes containing duplicated
object instances. We investigate OGRG in two settings: (1) Referring Grasp
Synthesis (RGS) under pixel-wise full supervision, and (2) Referring Grasp
Affordance (RGA) using weakly supervised learning with only single-pixel grasp
annotations. Key contributions include a bi-directional vision-language fusion
module and the integration of depth information to enhance geometric reasoning,
improving both grounding and grasping performance. Experiment results show that
OGRG outperforms strong baselines in tabletop scenes with diverse spatial
language instructions. In RGS, it operates at 17.59 FPS on a single NVIDIA RTX
2080 Ti GPU, enabling potential use in closed-loop or multi-object sequential
grasping, while delivering superior grounding and grasp prediction accuracy
compared to all the baselines considered. Under the weakly supervised RGA
setting, OGRG also surpasses baseline grasp-success rates in both simulation
and real-robot trials, underscoring the effectiveness of its spatial reasoning
design. Project page: https://z.umn.edu/ogrg

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在计算成本高或依赖外部安全评估器的问题，需要在异构驾驶行为下平衡安全性、效率和可扩展性。

Method: 基于平均场博弈理论，通过随机微分方程保证纳什均衡和指数收敛，无需额外安全模块即可捕捉保守、激进和合作行为。

Result: 在车道变换和超车场景的仿真中，IUPF确保安全距离，生成平滑高效的轨迹，在适应性和计算效率上优于传统优化和博弈论基线方法。

Conclusion: IUPF框架有效解决了自动驾驶交互轨迹规划的关键挑战，在安全性和计算性能方面表现出色。

Abstract: Interactive trajectory planning in autonomous driving must balance safety,
efficiency, and scalability under heterogeneous driving behaviors. Existing
methods often face high computational cost or rely on external safety critics.
To address this, we propose an Interaction-Enriched Unified Potential Field
(IUPF) framework that fuses style-dependent benefit and risk fields through a
physics-inspired variational model, grounded in mean field game theory. The
approach captures conservative, aggressive, and cooperative behaviors without
additional safety modules, and employs stochastic differential equations to
guarantee Nash equilibrium with exponential convergence. Simulations on lane
changing and overtaking scenarios show that IUPF ensures safe distances,
generates smooth and efficient trajectories, and outperforms traditional
optimization and game-theoretic baselines in both adaptability and
computational efficiency.

*Viraj Parimi,Brian C. Williams*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RB-CBS是一种新颖的多智能体路径规划方法，通过动态分配和调整风险预算，在保证安全性的同时提高任务效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统规划方法依赖预定义距离度量，而安全强化学习在多智能体目标条件场景中表现不佳。现有的图剪枝方法过于保守，限制了任务效率。

Method: 提出RB-CBS扩展方法，动态分配用户指定的风险边界(Δ)给各个智能体，为每个智能体提供本地风险预算(δ)，在保持整体安全约束的同时实现更高效的导航。

Result: 实验结果表明，这种迭代风险分配框架在复杂环境中表现出优越性能，使多个智能体能够在用户指定的Δ范围内找到无碰撞路径。

Conclusion: RB-CBS方法成功解决了多智能体视觉导航中的安全与效率权衡问题，为危险环境中的自主系统提供了更灵活的路径规划解决方案。

Abstract: Safe navigation is essential for autonomous systems operating in hazardous
environments, especially when multiple agents must coordinate using just visual
inputs over extended time horizons. Traditional planning methods excel at
solving long-horizon tasks but rely on predefined distance metrics, while safe
Reinforcement Learning (RL) can learn complex behaviors using high-dimensional
inputs yet struggles with multi-agent, goal-conditioned scenarios. Recent work
combined these paradigms by leveraging goal-conditioned RL (GCRL) to build an
intermediate graph from replay buffer states, pruning unsafe edges, and using
Conflict-Based Search (CBS) for multi-agent path planning. Although effective,
this graph-pruning approach can be overly conservative, limiting mission
efficiency by precluding missions that must traverse high-risk regions. To
address this limitation, we propose RB-CBS, a novel extension to CBS that
dynamically allocates and adjusts user-specified risk bound ($\Delta$) across
agents to flexibly trade off safety and speed. Our improved planner ensures
that each agent receives a local risk budget ($\delta$) enabling more efficient
navigation while still respecting overall safety constraints. Experimental
results demonstrate that this iterative risk-allocation framework yields
superior performance in complex environments, allowing multiple agents to find
collision-free paths within the user-specified $\Delta$.

Result: 在多种模拟环境中比较了不同方法的准确性，单调样条拟合方法表现最佳，在计算受限的四旋翼飞行器上实现15Hz的计量深度估计

Conclusion: 该方法能够在轻量级硬件上实现高频率的计量深度估计，成功集成到动作基础规划器中实现了有效的碰撞避免

Abstract: This paper presents a methodology to predict metric depth from monocular RGB
images and an inertial measurement unit (IMU). To enable collision avoidance
during autonomous flight, prior works either leverage heavy sensors (e.g.,
LiDARs or stereo cameras) or data-intensive and domain-specific fine-tuning of
monocular metric depth estimation methods. In contrast, we propose several
lightweight zero-shot rescaling strategies to obtain metric depth from relative
depth estimates via the sparse 3D feature map created using a visual-inertial
navigation system. These strategies are compared for their accuracy in diverse
simulation environments. The best performing approach, which leverages
monotonic spline fitting, is deployed in the real-world on a
compute-constrained quadrotor. We obtain on-board metric depth estimates at 15
Hz and demonstrate successful collision avoidance after integrating the
proposed method with a motion primitives-based planner.

Result: 在不同团队规模下与替代学习方法相比，证明了方法的有效性和实际应用性

Conclusion: DG-MAP方法通过专门化生成模型和结构化分解，成功提升了学习模型在多机械臂规划中的可扩展性，同时降低了对大规模数据集的需求

Abstract: Multi-arm motion planning is fundamental for enabling arms to complete
complex long-horizon tasks in shared spaces efficiently but current methods
struggle with scalability due to exponential state-space growth and reliance on
large training datasets for learned models. Inspired by Multi-Agent Path
Finding (MAPF), which decomposes planning into single-agent problems coupled
with collision resolution, we propose a novel diffusion-guided multi-arm
planner (DG-MAP) that enhances scalability of learning-based models while
reducing their reliance on massive multi-arm datasets. Recognizing that
collisions are primarily pairwise, we train two conditional diffusion models,
one to generate feasible single-arm trajectories, and a second, to model the
dual-arm dynamics required for effective pairwise collision resolution. By
integrating these specialized generative models within a MAPF-inspired
structured decomposition, our planner efficiently scales to larger number of
arms. Evaluations against alternative learning-based methods across various
team sizes demonstrate our method's effectiveness and practical applicability.

Abstract: This paper presents a reinforcement learning-based quadrotor navigation
method that leverages efficient differentiable simulation, novel loss
functions, and privileged information to navigate around large obstacles. Prior
learning-based methods perform well in scenes that exhibit narrow obstacles,
but struggle when the goal location is blocked by large walls or terrain. In
contrast, the proposed method utilizes time-of-arrival (ToA) maps as privileged
information and a yaw alignment loss to guide the robot around large obstacles.
The policy is evaluated in photo-realistic simulation environments containing
large obstacles, sharp corners, and dead-ends. Our approach achieves an 86%
success rate and outperforms baseline strategies by 34%. We deploy the policy
onboard a custom quadrotor in outdoor cluttered environments both during the

without collisions at speeds up to 4 m/s.

Motivation: 自动驾驶研究广泛采用深度强化学习，但缺乏对这些算法如何被使用、基准测试和评估的系统性分析。本文旨在填补这一空白，为研究社区提供统一的分类和参考。

Method: 系统分析约100篇同行评审论文，按算法家族（无模型、基于模型、分层、混合）分类，量化其流行度，分析状态/动作/奖励公式，整理评估指标和测试场景。

Result: 发现80%以上研究仍依赖无模型方法（DQN、PPO、SAC）；总结了传感器模态、控制抽象和奖励设计的多样性；整理了常用评估指标和CARLA基准测试配置。

Abstract: Autonomous-driving research has recently embraced deep Reinforcement Learning
(RL) as a promising framework for data-driven decision making, yet a clear
picture of how these algorithms are currently employed, benchmarked and
evaluated is still missing. This survey fills that gap by systematically
analysing around 100 peer-reviewed papers that train, test or validate RL
policies inside the open-source CARLA simulator. We first categorize the
literature by algorithmic family model-free, model-based, hierarchical, and
hybrid and quantify their prevalence, highlighting that more than 80% of
existing studies still rely on model-free methods such as DQN, PPO and SAC.
Next, we explain the diverse state, action and reward formulations adopted
across works, illustrating how choices of sensor modality (RGB, LiDAR, BEV,
semantic maps, and carla kinematics states), control abstraction (discrete vs.
continuous) and reward shaping are used across various literature. We also
consolidate the evaluation landscape by listing the most common metrics
(success rate, collision rate, lane deviation, driving score) and the towns,
scenarios and traffic configurations used in CARLA benchmarks. Persistent
challenges including sparse rewards, sim-to-real transfer, safety guarantees
and limited behaviour diversity are distilled into a set of open research
questions, and promising directions such as model-based RL, meta-learning and
richer multi-agent simulations are outlined. By providing a unified taxonomy,
quantitative statistics and a critical discussion of limitations, this review
aims to serve both as a reference for newcomers and as a roadmap for advancing
RL-based autonomous driving toward real-world deployment.

Motivation: 解决双向遥控系统复杂难实现的问题，提供一种简单、低成本的力反馈遥控方案，以支持接触丰富操作任务的数据采集

Method: 使用简单反馈控制器的双向遥控方法，无需力传感器，适用于主从设置和低成本硬件

Result: 方法参数调整最小化，实现高操作性和接触稳定性，超过传统方法；在低通信频率下仍保持良好性能；在两种商用低成本硬件上无需参数调整即可实现

Conclusion: 该方法具有高实现简便性和适用性，有望扩大力反馈遥控系统在低成本硬件上的应用，推动任务自主性的发展

Abstract: Effective data collection in contact-rich manipulation requires force
feedback during teleoperation, as accurate perception of contact is crucial for
stable control. However, such technology remains uncommon, largely because
bilateral teleoperation systems are complex and difficult to implement. To
overcome this, we propose a bilateral teleoperation method that relies only on
a simple feedback controller and does not require force sensors. The approach
is designed for leader-follower setups using low-cost hardware, making it
broadly applicable. Through numerical simulations and real-world experiments,
we demonstrate that the method requires minimal parameter tuning, yet achieves
both high operability and contact stability, outperforming conventional
approaches. Furthermore, we show its high robustness: even at low communication
cycle rates between leader and follower, control performance degradation is
minimal compared to high-speed operation. We also prove our method can be
implemented on two types of commercially available low-cost hardware with zero
parameter adjustments. This highlights its high ease of implementation and
versatility. We expect this method will expand the use of force feedback
teleoperation systems on low-cost hardware. This will contribute to advancing
contact-rich task autonomy in imitation learning.

Motivation: 传统手工编程的事件视觉里程计方法在低光照高动态范围条件下可靠性不足，需要利用深度学习来充分发挥事件相机的微秒级分辨率优势。

Method: 基于DEVO构建Stereo-DEVO系统，提出静态双目关联策略进行稀疏深度估计，紧耦合束优化方案，通过组基于事件表示的递归网络进行光流估计建立可靠的补丁关联。

Result: 系统能够实时处理VGA分辨率事件数据，在多个公开数据集和自收集数据上表现優异，超越了现有的事件视觉里程计方法，在大规模夜间HDR场景中供给稳定的位估结果。

Conclusion: Stereo-DEVO系统通过深度学习技术有效解决了传统事件视觉里程计在极端光照条件下的可靠性问题，为野外机器人应用提供了可靠的实时位置估计能力。

Abstract: Event-based cameras are bio-inspired sensors with pixels that independently
and asynchronously respond to brightness changes at microsecond resolution,
offering the potential to handle state estimation tasks involving motion blur
and high dynamic range (HDR) illumination conditions. However, the versatility
of event-based visual odometry (VO) relying on handcrafted data association
(either direct or indirect methods) is still unreliable, especially in field
robot applications under low-light HDR conditions, where the dynamic range can
be enormous and the signal-to-noise ratio is spatially-and-temporally varying.
Leveraging deep neural networks offers new possibilities for overcoming these
challenges. In this paper, we propose a learning-based stereo event visual
odometry. Building upon Deep Event Visual Odometry (DEVO), our system (called
Stereo-DEVO) introduces a novel and efficient static-stereo association
strategy for sparse depth estimation with almost no additional computational
burden. By integrating it into a tightly coupled bundle adjustment (BA)
optimization scheme, and benefiting from the recurrent network's ability to
perform accurate optical flow estimation through voxel-based event
representations to establish reliable patch associations, our system achieves
high-precision pose estimation in metric scale. In contrast to the offline
performance of DEVO, our system can process event data of \zs{Video Graphics
Array} (VGA) resolution in real time. Extensive evaluations on multiple public
real-world datasets and self-collected data justify our system's versatility,
demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art event-based VO
methods. More importantly, our system achieves stable pose estimation even in
large-scale nighttime HDR scenarios.

Conclusion: RKL方法为数据驱动控制提供了样本高效、轻量级的解决方案，特别适用于硬件学习和实时应用场景，已开源高性能C++代码库

Abstract: Data-driven control methods need to be sample-efficient and lightweight,
especially when data acquisition and computational resources are limited --
such as during learning on hardware. Most modern data-driven methods require
large datasets and struggle with real-time updates of models, limiting their
performance in dynamic environments. Koopman theory formally represents
nonlinear systems as linear models over observables, and Koopman
representations can be determined from data in an optimization-friendly setting
with potentially rapid model updates. In this paper, we present a highly
sample-efficient, Koopman-based learning pipeline: Recursive Koopman Learning
(RKL). We identify sufficient conditions for model convergence and provide
formal algorithmic analysis supporting our claim that RKL is lightweight and
fast, with complexity independent of dataset size. We validate our method on a
simulated planar two-link arm and a hybrid nonlinear hardware system with soft
actuators, showing that real-time recursive Koopman model updates improve the
sample efficiency and stability of data-driven controller synthesis --
requiring only <10% of the data compared to benchmarks. The high-performance
C++ codebase is open-sourced. Website:

Conclusion: 行为异构的机器人团队在探索任务中具有显著优势，分布式博弈论方法能有效解决多智能体任务分配问题

Abstract: We study a problem of multi-agent exploration with behaviorally heterogeneous
robots. Each robot maps its surroundings using SLAM and identifies a set of
areas of interest (AoIs) or frontiers that are the most informative to explore
next. The robots assess the utility of going to a frontier using Behavioral
Entropy (BE) and then determine which frontier to go to via a distributed task
assignment scheme. We convert the task assignment problem into a
non-cooperative game and use a distributed algorithm (d-PBRAG) to converge to
the Nash equilibrium (which we show is the optimal task allocation solution).
For unknown utility cases, we provide robust bounds using approximate rewards.
We test our algorithm (which has less communication cost and fast convergence)
in simulation, where we explore the effect of sensing radii, sensing accuracy,
and heterogeneity among robotic teams with respect to the time taken to
complete exploration and path traveled. We observe that having a team of agents
with heterogeneous behaviors is beneficial.

Abstract: In robotic systems, the performance of reinforcement learning depends on the
rationality of predefined reward functions. However, manually designed reward
functions often lead to policy failures due to inaccuracies. Inverse
Reinforcement Learning (IRL) addresses this problem by inferring implicit
reward functions from expert demonstrations. Nevertheless, existing methods
rely heavily on large amounts of expert demonstrations to accurately recover
the reward function. The high cost of collecting expert demonstrations in
robotic applications, particularly in multi-robot systems, severely hinders the
practical deployment of IRL. Consequently, improving sample efficiency has
emerged as a critical challenge in multi-agent inverse reinforcement learning
(MIRL). Inspired by the symmetry inherent in multi-agent systems, this work
theoretically demonstrates that leveraging symmetry enables the recovery of
more accurate reward functions. Building upon this insight, we propose a
universal framework that integrates symmetry into existing multi-agent
adversarial IRL algorithms, thereby significantly enhancing sample efficiency.
Experimental results from multiple challenging tasks have demonstrated the
effectiveness of this framework. Further validation in physical multi-robot
systems has shown the practicality of our method.

foundational aspects. We conclude by discussing key challenges, particularly
those associated with the integration of these capabilities into real-time,

demands and ensuring model reliability against issues like hallucinations and
out-of-distribution failures. The survey also outlines crucial future research
directions to enable the safe and effective deployment of foundation models in

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效地实现人类直觉操作向机器人执行的抓取技能转移，为机器手的灵敏操作提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Tactile and kinesthetic perceptions are crucial for human dexterous
manipulation, enabling reliable grasping of objects via proprioceptive
sensorimotor integration. For robotic hands, even though acquiring such tactile
and kinesthetic feedback is feasible, establishing a direct mapping from this
sensory feedback to motor actions remains challenging. In this paper, we
propose a novel glove-mediated tactile-kinematic perception-prediction
framework for grasp skill transfer from human intuitive and natural operation
to robotic execution based on imitation learning, and its effectiveness is
validated through generalized grasping tasks, including those involving
deformable objects. Firstly, we integrate a data glove to capture tactile and
kinesthetic data at the joint level. The glove is adaptable for both human and
robotic hands, allowing data collection from natural human hand demonstrations
across different scenarios. It ensures consistency in the raw data format,
enabling evaluation of grasping for both human and robotic hands. Secondly, we
establish a unified representation of multi-modal inputs based on graph
structures with polar coordinates. We explicitly integrate the morphological
differences into the designed representation, enhancing the compatibility
across different demonstrators and robotic hands. Furthermore, we introduce the
Tactile-Kinesthetic Spatio-Temporal Graph Networks (TK-STGN), which leverage
multidimensional subgraph convolutions and attention-based LSTM layers to
extract spatio-temporal features from graph inputs to predict node-based states
for each hand joint. These predictions are then mapped to final commands
through a force-position hybrid mapping.

TL;DR: PegasusFlow是一个无需专家数据的轨迹规划框架，通过并行采样和环境交互直接学习轨迹分数梯度，在复杂地形导航任务中表现优异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决扩散模型在机器人轨迹规划中依赖专家演示数据的问题，特别是在专业机器人数据稀缺场景下的应用限制

Method: 提出分层滚动去噪框架，采用加权基函数优化(WBFO)算法利用样条基表示实现高效采样，结合异步并行仿真架构进行大规模并行数据收集

Result: 在轨迹优化和机器人导航任务中显著优于基线方法，在障碍跨越任务中达到100%成功率且比次优方法快18%

Conclusion: 该方法完全绕过专家数据需求，为复杂地形运动规划提供了高效实用的解决方案

Abstract: Diffusion models offer powerful generative capabilities for robot trajectory
planning, yet their practical deployment on robots is hindered by a critical
bottleneck: a reliance on imitation learning from expert demonstrations. This
paradigm is often impractical for specialized robots where data is scarce and
creates an inefficient, theoretically suboptimal training pipeline. To overcome
this, we introduce PegasusFlow, a hierarchical rolling-denoising framework that
enables direct and parallel sampling of trajectory score gradients from
environmental interaction, completely bypassing the need for expert data. Our
core innovation is a novel sampling algorithm, Weighted Basis Function
Optimization (WBFO), which leverages spline basis representations to achieve
superior sample efficiency and faster convergence compared to traditional
methods like MPPI. The framework is embedded within a scalable, asynchronous
parallel simulation architecture that supports massively parallel rollouts for
efficient data collection. Extensive experiments on trajectory optimization and
robotic navigation tasks demonstrate that our approach, particularly
Action-Value WBFO (AVWBFO) combined with a reinforcement learning warm-start,
significantly outperforms baselines. In a challenging barrier-crossing task,
our method achieved a 100% success rate and was 18% faster than the next-best
method, validating its effectiveness for complex terrain locomotion planning.

Result: 在Gazebo仿真环境中使用Franka Emika Panda机器人验证，相比两个基线控制器在多种轨迹上表现更优

Conclusion: VAICAM控制器能够有效提升力跟踪性能，特别适合快速运动场景，解决了传统方法调参复杂的问题

Abstract: As robotics gains popularity, interaction control becomes crucial for
ensuring force tracking in manipulator-based tasks. Typically, traditional
interaction controllers either require extensive tuning, or demand expert
knowledge of the environment, which is often impractical in real-world
applications. This work proposes a novel control strategy leveraging Neural
Networks (NNs) to enhance the force-tracking behavior of a Direct Force
Controller (DFC). Unlike similar previous approaches, it accounts for the
manipulator's tangential velocity, a critical factor in force exertion,
especially during fast motions. The method employs an ensemble of feedforward
NNs to predict contact forces, then exploits the prediction to solve an
optimization problem and generate an optimal residual action, which is added to
the DFC output and applied to an impedance controller. The proposed
Velocity-augmented Artificial intelligence Interaction Controller for Ambiguous
Models (VAICAM) is validated in the Gazebo simulator on a Franka Emika Panda
robot. Against a vast set of trajectories, VAICAM achieves superior performance
compared to two baseline controllers.

Abstract: Recent advances in robotics have enabled the widespread deployment of
autonomous robotic systems in complex operational environments, presenting both
unprecedented opportunities and significant security problems. Traditional
shepherding approaches based on fixed formations are often ineffective or risky
in urban and obstacle-rich scenarios, especially when facing adversarial agents
with unknown and adaptive behaviors. This paper addresses this challenge as an
extended herding problem, where defensive robotic systems must safely guide
adversarial agents with unknown strategies away from protected areas and into
predetermined safe regions, while maintaining collision-free navigation in
dynamic environments. We propose a hierarchical hybrid framework based on
reach-avoid game theory and local motion planning, incorporating a virtual
containment boundary and event-triggered pursuit mechanisms to enable scalable
and robust multi-agent coordination. Simulation results demonstrate that the
proposed approach achieves safe and efficient guidance of adversarial agents to
designated regions.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: CLAP是一种基于聚类的定位方法，通过场对特征对估计机器人状态进行聚类，在RoboCup 2024人形足球机器人比赛中获胜。该方法对噪声和错误输入具有强鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于比赛规则限制只能使用立体视觉和惯性传感器，且需要应对变化的光照条件、动态特征遮挡、高冲击步态噪声以及旁观者和邻近场地的干扰特征，因此需要一个准确且特别鲁棒的定位算法作为路径规划和比赛策略的基础。

Method: CLAP通过聚类从场对特征对估计的机器人状态来定位全局位置和方向。正确的状态估计自然聚集在一起，而不正确的估计则分散开，使其对噪声和错误输入具有弹性。该方法与粒子滤波器和扩展卡尔曼滤波器结合使用以提高一致性和平滑性。

Result: 测试表明CLAP与其他基于地标的定位方法具有相似的准确性，但在增加误检特征的情况下，CLAP在鲁棒性方面表现更优，几乎没有发散和速度跳跃。在比赛中定位表现良好，使机器人能够远距离射门并严密防守。

Conclusion: CLAP是一种有效的定位方法，特别适用于具有挑战性的环境条件，通过聚类机制实现了对噪声和错误输入的强鲁棒性，在实际比赛中证明了其有效性。

Abstract: In this paper, we present our localization method called CLAP, Clustering to
Localize Across $n$ Possibilities, which helped us win the RoboCup 2024
adult-sized autonomous humanoid soccer competition. Competition rules limited
our sensor suite to stereo vision and an inertial sensor, similar to humans. In
addition, our robot had to deal with varying lighting conditions, dynamic
feature occlusions, noise from high-impact stepping, and mistaken features from
bystanders and neighboring fields. Therefore, we needed an accurate, and most
importantly robust localization algorithm that would be the foundation for our
path-planning and game-strategy algorithms. CLAP achieves these requirements by
clustering estimated states of our robot from pairs of field features to
localize its global position and orientation. Correct state estimates naturally
cluster together, while incorrect estimates spread apart, making CLAP resilient
to noise and incorrect inputs. CLAP is paired with a particle filter and an
extended Kalman filter to improve consistency and smoothness. Tests of CLAP
with other landmark-based localization methods showed similar accuracy.
However, tests with increased false positive feature detection showed that CLAP
outperformed other methods in terms of robustness with very little divergence
and velocity jumps. Our localization performed well in competition, allowing
our robot to shoot faraway goals and narrowly defend our goal.

Through a series of co-design workshops (61 participants across 7 sessions)
including those with lived experience of frailty, their carers, and healthcare
professionals, we gained a deeper understanding of everyday issues concerning
the place of new technologies in their lives. A persona-based approach surfaced
emotional, social, and psychological issues. Any assistive solution must be
developed in the context of this complex interplay of psychosocial and
environmental factors. Our findings, presented as design requirements in direct

TL;DR: FMT^x是Fast Marching Tree算法的扩展版本，通过在动态环境中实现高效重规划来解决单次规划的限制，保持渐近最优性和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态环境中的路径规划是机器人技术的核心挑战，现有算法如FMT*在静态环境中表现良好但无法实时适应环境变化，而完全重规划计算成本过高。

Method: 修改FMT*的邻居选择规则，维护成本排序的优先队列，应用选择性更新条件，通过扩展邻居识别并触发潜在次优路径节点的重新评估。

Result: FMT^x在动态事件中反应更迅速，计算开销更低，性能优于有影响力的重规划器RRT^x。

Conclusion: FMT^x为不可预测世界中的实时机器人导航提供了更有效的解决方案，能够在环境变化后恢复渐近最优解。

Abstract: Path planning in dynamic environments remains a core challenge in robotics,
especially as autonomous systems are deployed in unpredictable spaces such as
warehouses and public roads. While algorithms like Fast Marching Tree
(FMT$^{*}$) offer asymptotically optimal solutions in static settings, their
single-pass design prevents path revisions which are essential for real-time
adaptation. On the other hand, full replanning is often too computationally
expensive. This paper introduces FMT$^{x}$, an extension of the Fast Marching
Tree algorithm that enables efficient and consistent replanning in dynamic
environments. We revisit the neighbor selection rule of FMT$^{*}$ and
demonstrate that a minimal change overcomes its single-pass limitation,
enabling the algorithm to update cost-to-come values upon discovering better
connections without sacrificing asymptotic optimality or computational
efficiency. By maintaining a cost-ordered priority queue and applying a
selective update condition that uses an expanding neighbor to identify and
trigger the re-evaluation of any node with a potentially suboptimal path,
FMT$^{x}$ ensures that suboptimal routes are efficiently repaired as the
environment evolves. This targeted strategy preserves the inherent efficiency
of FMT$^{*}$ while enabling robust adaptation to changes in obstacle
configuration. FMT$^{x}$ is proven to recover an asymptotically optimal
solution after environmental changes. Experimental results demonstrate that
FMT$^{x}$ outperforms the influential replanner RRT$^{x}$, reacting more
swiftly to dynamic events with lower computational overhead and thus offering a
more effective solution for real-time robotic navigation in unpredictable
worlds.

Abstract: This paper presents RoboMatch, a novel unified teleoperation platform for
mobile manipulation with an auto-matching network architecture, designed to
tackle long-horizon tasks in dynamic environments. Our system enhances
teleoperation performance, data collection efficiency, task accuracy, and
operational stability. The core of RoboMatch is a cockpit-style control
interface that enables synchronous operation of the mobile base and dual arms,
significantly improving control precision and data collection. Moreover, we
introduce the Proprioceptive-Visual Enhanced Diffusion Policy (PVE-DP), which
leverages Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) for multi-scale visual feature
extraction and integrates high-precision IMUs at the end-effector to enrich
proprioceptive feedback, substantially boosting fine manipulation performance.
Furthermore, we propose an Auto-Matching Network (AMN) architecture that
decomposes long-horizon tasks into logical sequences and dynamically assigns
lightweight pre-trained models for distributed inference. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach improves data collection efficiency by over 20%,
increases task success rates by 20-30% with PVE-DP, and enhances long-horizon
inference performance by approximately 40% with AMN, offering a robust solution
for complex manipulation tasks.

Conclusion: 该框架能够自动化生成语义相关的测试用例，有效发现专业黑盒模型的故障模式，为模型安全审计提供了一种新方法。

Abstract: Specialized machine learning models, regardless of architecture and training,
are susceptible to failures in deployment. With their increasing use in high
risk situations, the ability to audit these models by determining their
operational design domain (ODD) is crucial in ensuring safety and compliance.
However, given the high-dimensional input spaces, this process often requires
significant human resources and domain expertise. To alleviate this, we
introduce \coolname, an LLM-Agent centric framework for automated generation of
semantically relevant test cases to search for failure modes in specialized
black-box models. By leveraging LLM-Agents as tool orchestrators, we aim to fit
a uncertainty-aware failure distribution model on a learned text-embedding
manifold by projecting the high-dimension input space to low-dimension
text-embedding latent space. The LLM-Agent is tasked with iteratively building
the failure landscape by leveraging tools for generating test-cases to probe
the model-under-test (MUT) and recording the response. The agent also guides
the search using tools to probe uncertainty estimate on the low dimensional
manifold. We demonstrate this process in a simple case using models trained
with missing digits on the MNIST dataset and in the real world setting of
vision-based intruder detection for aerial vehicles.

Conclusion: 提供了一种更适应性强、效果更好的开集环境视觉导航解决方案

Abstract: Visual navigation in robotics traditionally relies on globally-consistent 3D
maps or learned controllers, which can be computationally expensive and
difficult to generalize across diverse environments. In this work, we present a
novel RGB-only, object-level topometric navigation pipeline that enables
zero-shot, long-horizon robot navigation without requiring 3D maps or
pre-trained controllers. Our approach integrates global topological path
planning with local metric trajectory control, allowing the robot to navigate
towards object-level sub-goals while avoiding obstacles. We address key
limitations of previous methods by continuously predicting local trajectory
using monocular depth and traversability estimation, and incorporating an
auto-switching mechanism that falls back to a baseline controller when
necessary. The system operates using foundational models, ensuring open-set
applicability without the need for domain-specific fine-tuning. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our method in both simulated environments and real-world
tests, highlighting its robustness and deployability. Our approach outperforms
existing state-of-the-art methods, offering a more adaptable and effective
solution for visual navigation in open-set environments. The source code is

Conclusion: IRG框架能够渐进收敛到最优解，所提出的并行算法在多个实际应用场景中表现出优越性能，为解决复杂移动目标拦截问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: The Moving Target Traveling Salesman Problem (MT-TSP) seeks an agent
trajectory that intercepts several moving targets, within a particular time
window for each target. In the presence of generic nonlinear target
trajectories or kinematic constraints on the agent, no prior algorithm
guarantees convergence to an optimal MT-TSP solution. Therefore, we introduce
the Iterated Random Generalized (IRG) TSP framework. The key idea behind IRG is
to alternate between randomly sampling a set of agent configuration-time
points, corresponding to interceptions of targets, and finding a sequence of
interception points by solving a generalized TSP (GTSP). This alternation
enables asymptotic convergence to the optimum. We introduce two parallel
algorithms within the IRG framework. The first algorithm, IRG-PGLNS, solves
GTSPs using PGLNS, our parallelized extension of the state-of-the-art solver
GLNS. The second algorithm, Parallel Communicating GTSPs (PCG), solves GTSPs
corresponding to several sets of points simultaneously. We present numerical
results for three variants of the MT-TSP: one where intercepting a target only
requires coming within a particular distance, another where the agent is a
variable-speed Dubins car, and a third where the agent is a redundant robot
arm. We show that IRG-PGLNS and PCG both converge faster than a baseline based
on prior work.

Abstract: Robot navigation in dynamic, human-centered environments requires
socially-compliant decisions grounded in robust scene understanding. Recent
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit promising capabilities such as object
recognition, common-sense reasoning, and contextual understanding-capabilities
that align with the nuanced requirements of social robot navigation. However,
it remains unclear whether VLMs can accurately understand complex social
navigation scenes (e.g., inferring the spatial-temporal relations among agents
and human intentions), which is essential for safe and socially compliant robot
navigation. While some recent works have explored the use of VLMs in social
robot navigation, no existing work systematically evaluates their ability to
meet these necessary conditions. In this paper, we introduce the Social
Navigation Scene Understanding Benchmark (SocialNav-SUB), a Visual Question
Answering (VQA) dataset and benchmark designed to evaluate VLMs for scene
understanding in real-world social robot navigation scenarios. SocialNav-SUB
provides a unified framework for evaluating VLMs against human and rule-based
baselines across VQA tasks requiring spatial, spatiotemporal, and social
reasoning in social robot navigation. Through experiments with state-of-the-art
VLMs, we find that while the best-performing VLM achieves an encouraging
probability of agreeing with human answers, it still underperforms simpler
rule-based approach and human consensus baselines, indicating critical gaps in
social scene understanding of current VLMs. Our benchmark sets the stage for
further research on foundation models for social robot navigation, offering a
framework to explore how VLMs can be tailored to meet real-world social robot
navigation needs. An overview of this paper along with the code and data can be

Abstract: Model-free diffusion planners have shown great promise for robot motion
planning, but practical robotic systems often require combining them with
model-based optimization modules to enforce constraints, such as safety.
Naively integrating these modules presents compatibility challenges when
diffusion's multi-modal outputs behave adversarially to optimization-based
modules. To address this, we introduce Joint Model-based Model-free Diffusion
(JM2D), a novel generative modeling framework. JM2D formulates module
integration as a joint sampling problem to maximize compatibility via an
interaction potential, without additional training. Using importance sampling,
JM2D guides modules outputs based only on evaluations of the interaction
potential, thus handling non-differentiable objectives commonly arising from
non-convex optimization modules. We evaluate JM2D via application to aligning
diffusion planners with safety modules on offline RL and robot manipulation.
JM2D significantly improves task performance compared to conventional safety
filters without sacrificing safety. Further, we show that conditional
generation is a special case of JM2D and elucidate key design choices by
comparing with SOTA gradient-based and projection-based diffusion planners.

However, reliable interaction typically requires a 3D scene representation that
is metric-scaled and aligned with the robot reference frame. This depends on
accurate camera-to-robot calibration and dense 3D reconstruction, tasks usually
treated separately, despite both relying on geometric correspondences from RGB
data. Traditional calibration needs patterns, while RGB-based reconstruction
yields geometry with an unknown scale in an arbitrary frame. Multi-camera
setups add further complexity, as data must be expressed in a shared reference
frame. We present Calib3R, a patternless method that jointly performs
camera-to-robot calibration and metric-scaled 3D reconstruction via unified
optimization. Calib3R handles single- and multi-camera setups on robot arms or
mobile robots. It builds on the 3D foundation model MASt3R to extract pointmaps
from RGB images, which are combined with robot poses to reconstruct a scaled 3D
scene aligned with the robot. Experiments on diverse datasets show that Calib3R
achieves accurate calibration with less than 10 images, outperforming
target-less and marker-based methods.

Conclusion: RoboChemist框架有效解决了化学实验自动化的挑战，为机器人化学家的发展提供了重要进展

Abstract: Robotic chemists promise to both liberate human experts from repetitive tasks
and accelerate scientific discovery, yet remain in their infancy. Chemical
experiments involve long-horizon procedures over hazardous and deformable
substances, where success requires not only task completion but also strict
compliance with experimental norms. To address these challenges, we propose
\textit{RoboChemist}, a dual-loop framework that integrates Vision-Language
Models (VLMs) with Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. Unlike prior VLM-based
systems (e.g., VoxPoser, ReKep) that rely on depth perception and struggle with
transparent labware, and existing VLA systems (e.g., RDT, pi0) that lack
semantic-level feedback for complex tasks, our method leverages a VLM to serve
as (1) a planner to decompose tasks into primitive actions, (2) a visual prompt
generator to guide VLA models, and (3) a monitor to assess task success and
regulatory compliance. Notably, we introduce a VLA interface that accepts
image-based visual targets from the VLM, enabling precise, goal-conditioned
control. Our system successfully executes both primitive actions and complete
multi-step chemistry protocols. Results show 23.57% higher average success rate
and a 0.298 average increase in compliance rate over state-of-the-art VLA
baselines, while also demonstrating strong generalization to objects and tasks.

Method: 利用边界框作为部件生成提示，注入点级语义特征实现有意义分解，并设计了可编辑的交互式部件生成流程。

Result: 在部件级形状生成方面达到了最先进的性能，实验结果表明具有高几何保真度。

Conclusion: 为创建生产就绪、可编辑且结构合理的3D资产建立了新范式。

Abstract: Generating 3D shapes at part level is pivotal for downstream applications
such as mesh retopology, UV mapping, and 3D printing. However, existing
part-based generation methods often lack sufficient controllability and suffer
from poor semantically meaningful decomposition. To this end, we introduce
X-Part, a controllable generative model designed to decompose a holistic 3D
object into semantically meaningful and structurally coherent parts with high
geometric fidelity. X-Part exploits the bounding box as prompts for the part
generation and injects point-wise semantic features for meaningful
decomposition. Furthermore, we design an editable pipeline for interactive part
generation. Extensive experimental results show that X-Part achieves
state-of-the-art performance in part-level shape generation. This work
establishes a new paradigm for creating production-ready, editable, and
structurally sound 3D assets. Codes will be released for public research.
