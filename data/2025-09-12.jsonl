When the MAS has to deal with active obstacles\nin a highly partially observable environment, the communication channel\nacquires considerable relevance. In this paper, we present an approach to deal\nwith task assignments in extremely active scenarios, where tasks need to be\nfrequently reallocated among the agents participating in the coordination\nprocess. Inspired by market-based task assignments, we introduce a novel\ndistributed coordination method to orchestrate autonomous agents' actions\nefficiently in low communication scenarios. In particular, our algorithm takes\ninto account asymmetric obstacles. While in the real world, the majority of\nobstacles are asymmetric, they are usually treated as symmetric ones, thus\nlimiting the applicability of existing methods. To summarize, the presented\narchitecture is designed to tackle scenarios where the obstacles are active and\nasymmetric, the communication channel is poor and the environment is partially\nobservable. Our approach has been validated in simulation and in the real\nworld, using a team of NAO robots during official RoboCup competitions.\nExperimental results show a notable reduction in task overlaps in limited\ncommunication settings, with a decrease of 52% in the most frequent reallocated\ntask."}

In this work, we introduce SimpleVLA-RL, an efficient RL\nframework tailored for VLA models. Building upon veRL, we introduce\nVLA-specific trajectory sampling, scalable parallelization, multi-environment\nrendering, and optimized loss computation. When applied to OpenVLA-OFT,\nSimpleVLA-RL achieves SoTA performance on LIBERO and even outperforms $\\pi_0$\non RoboTwin 1.0\\&2.0 with the exploration-enhancing strategies we introduce.\nSimpleVLA-RL not only reduces dependence on large-scale data and enables robust\ngeneralization, but also remarkably surpasses SFT in real-world tasks.\nMoreover, we identify a novel phenomenon ``pushcut'' during RL training,\nwherein the policy discovers previously unseen patterns beyond those seen in\nthe previous training process.

However, this\ntask remains largely unexplored, especially in realistic scenarios without\npre-existing segmentation or annotations. In this paper, we introduce a novel\nand practical task: predicting region-wise correspondence between raw manga\nline art images without any pre-existing labels or masks. To tackle this\nproblem, we divide each line art image into a set of patches and propose a\nTransformer-based framework that learns patch-level similarities within and\nacross images. We then apply edge-aware clustering and a region matching\nalgorithm to convert patch-level predictions into coherent region-level\ncorrespondences. To support training and evaluation, we develop an automatic\nannotation pipeline and manually refine a subset of the data to construct\nbenchmark datasets. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that our\nmethod achieves high patch-level accuracy (e.g., 96.34%) and generates\nconsistent region-level correspondences, highlighting its potential for\nreal-world manga applications."}

We validate the\nproposed CameraVDP framework through three applications: defective pixel\ndetection, color fringing awareness, and display non-uniformity evaluation. Our\nuncertainty analysis framework enables the estimation of the theoretical upper\nbound for defect pixel detection performance and provides confidence intervals\nfor VDP quality scores."}

First, Geometric Adaptability Gap: models trained solely on 2D\ninputs or with hard-coded 3D geometry injection suffer from either insufficient\nspatial information or restricted 2D generalization, leading to poor\nadaptability across tasks with diverse spatial demands. Second, Embodiment\nConstraint Gap: prior work often neglects the physical constraints and\ncapacities of real robots, resulting in task plans that are theoretically valid\nbut practically infeasible.To address these gaps, we introduce OmniEVA -- an\nembodied versatile planner that enables advanced embodied reasoning and task\nplanning through two pivotal innovations: (1) a Task-Adaptive 3D Grounding\nmechanism, which introduces a gated router to perform explicit selective\nregulation of 3D fusion based on contextual requirements, enabling\ncontext-aware 3D grounding for diverse embodied tasks. (2) an Embodiment-Aware\nReasoning framework that jointly incorporates task goals and embodiment\nconstraints into the reasoning loop, resulting in planning decisions that are\nboth goal-directed and executable. Extensive experimental results demonstrate\nthat OmniEVA not only achieves state-of-the-art general embodied reasoning\nperformance, but also exhibits a strong ability across a wide range of\ndownstream scenarios. Evaluations of a suite of proposed embodied benchmarks,\nincluding both primitive and composite tasks, confirm its robust and versatile\nplanning capabilities.

This is typically achieved through an \"image-relative\"\napproach to estimating control from a given pair of current observation and\nsubgoal image. However, image-level representations of the world have\nlimitations because images are strictly tied to the agent's pose and\nembodiment. In contrast, objects, being a property of the map, offer an\nembodiment- and trajectory-invariant world representation. In this work, we\npresent a new paradigm of learning \"object-relative\" control that exhibits\nseveral desirable characteristics: a) new routes can be traversed without\nstrictly requiring to imitate prior experience, b) the control prediction\nproblem can be decoupled from solving the image matching problem, and c) high\ninvariance can be achieved in cross-embodiment deployment for variations across\nboth training-testing and mapping-execution settings. We propose a topometric\nmap representation in the form of a \"relative\" 3D scene graph, which is used to\nobtain more informative object-level global path planning costs. We train a\nlocal controller, dubbed \"ObjectReact\", conditioned directly on a high-level\n\"WayObject Costmap\" representation that eliminates the need for an explicit RGB\ninput. We demonstrate the advantages of learning object-relative control over\nits image-relative counterpart across sensor height variations and multiple\nnavigation tasks that challenge the underlying spatial understanding\ncapability, e.g., navigating a map trajectory in the reverse direction. We\nfurther show that our sim-only policy is able to generalize well to real-world\nindoor environments.

Yet demonstration inaccuracies and embodiment gaps between human\nand robot hands limit the straightforward use of these data. Existing methods\nadopt a three-stage workflow, including retargeting, tracking, and residual\ncorrection, which often leaves demonstrations underused and compound errors\nacross stages. We introduce Dexplore, a unified single-loop optimization that\njointly performs retargeting and tracking to learn robot control policies\ndirectly from MoCap at scale. Rather than treating demonstrations as ground\ntruth, we use them as soft guidance. From raw trajectories, we derive adaptive\nspatial scopes, and train with reinforcement learning to keep the policy\nin-scope while minimizing control effort and accomplishing the task. This\nunified formulation preserves demonstration intent, enables robot-specific\nstrategies to emerge, improves robustness to noise, and scales to large\ndemonstration corpora. We distill the scaled tracking policy into a\nvision-based, skill-conditioned generative controller that encodes diverse\nmanipulation skills in a rich latent representation, supporting generalization\nacross objects and real-world deployment. Taken together, these contributions\nposition Dexplore as a principled bridge that transforms imperfect\ndemonstrations into effective training signals for dexterous manipulation."}
