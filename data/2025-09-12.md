TL;DR: OSIM是一种新颖的3D场景评估指标，专注于物体层面的感知评估，比现有指标更符合人类视觉感知


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D场景评估指标主要关注整体图像质量，与人类基于物体单元的视觉感知存在差异，需要更符合人类感知的评估方法

Method: 利用物体检测模型及其特征表示来量化场景中每个物体的"物体性"，进行以物体为中心的评估

Result: 用户研究表明OSIM比现有指标更接近人类感知，并通过多种方法分析了OSIM的特性，重新评估了最新3D重建和生成模型

Conclusion: OSIM提供了一个更符合人类感知的3D场景评估框架，有助于明确该领域的技术进展

Abstract: This paper presents Objectness SIMilarity (OSIM), a novel evaluation metric
for 3D scenes that explicitly focuses on "objects," which are fundamental units
of human visual perception. Existing metrics assess overall image quality,
leading to discrepancies with human perception. Inspired by neuropsychological
insights, we hypothesize that human recognition of 3D scenes fundamentally
involves attention to individual objects. OSIM enables object-centric
evaluations by leveraging an object detection model and its feature
representations to quantify the "objectness" of each object in the scene. Our
user study demonstrates that OSIM aligns more closely with human perception
compared to existing metrics. We also analyze the characteristics of OSIM using
various approaches. Moreover, we re-evaluate recent 3D reconstruction and
generation models under a standardized experimental setup to clarify
advancements in this field. The code is available at

Method: ReT-2利用多层表示和循环Transformer架构，结合LSTM启发的门控机制，动态整合跨层和跨模态的信息，捕捉细粒度的视觉和文本细节。

Result: 在M2KR和M-BEIR基准测试中，ReT-2在不同检索配置下始终达到最先进性能，同时提供更快的推理速度和更低的内存使用。在检索增强生成管道中集成时，还能提升Encyclopedic-VQA和InfoSeek数据集的下游性能。

Conclusion: ReT-2是一个高效统一的多模态检索模型，支持复杂的多模态查询和检索任务，在性能和效率方面均优于现有方法，为多模态检索领域提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of multimodal retrieval and its application in
LLMs and multimodal LLMs, increasingly complex retrieval tasks have emerged.
Existing methods predominantly rely on task-specific fine-tuning of
vision-language models and are limited to single-modality queries or documents.
In this paper, we propose ReT-2, a unified retrieval model that supports
multimodal queries, composed of both images and text, and searches across
multimodal document collections where text and images coexist. ReT-2 leverages
multi-layer representations and a recurrent Transformer architecture with
LSTM-inspired gating mechanisms to dynamically integrate information across
layers and modalities, capturing fine-grained visual and textual details. We
evaluate ReT-2 on the challenging M2KR and M-BEIR benchmarks across different
retrieval configurations. Results demonstrate that ReT-2 consistently achieves
state-of-the-art performance across diverse settings, while offering faster
inference and reduced memory usage compared to prior approaches. When
integrated into retrieval-augmented generation pipelines, ReT-2 also improves
downstream performance on Encyclopedic-VQA and InfoSeek datasets. Our source

### [3] [Diffusion-Based Action Recognition Generalizes to Untrained Domains](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08908)
*Rogerio Guimaraes,Frank Xiao,Pietro Perona,Markus Marks*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 使用视觉扩散模型(VDM)特征和transformer聚合，实现跨物种、视角和上下文的人类级动作识别泛化能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类能够识别相同动作尽管存在巨大的上下文和视角变化，而当前深度学习模型在此类泛化方面存在困难

Method: 利用视觉扩散模型生成特征，通过transformer进行聚合，特别使用扩散过程早期时间步的条件模型来突出语义信息而非像素级细节

Result: 在跨物种分类、不同视角和不同记录上下文的动作识别任务中，该方法在所有三个泛化基准测试中都达到了新的最先进水平

Conclusion: 该方法使机器动作识别更接近人类级别的鲁棒性，为跨域动作识别提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Humans can recognize the same actions despite large context and viewpoint
variations, such as differences between species (walking in spiders vs.
horses), viewpoints (egocentric vs. third-person), and contexts (real life vs
movies). Current deep learning models struggle with such generalization. We
propose using features generated by a Vision Diffusion Model (VDM), aggregated
via a transformer, to achieve human-like action recognition across these
challenging conditions. We find that generalization is enhanced by the use of a
model conditioned on earlier timesteps of the diffusion process to highlight
semantic information over pixel level details in the extracted features. We
experimentally explore the generalization properties of our approach in
classifying actions across animal species, across different viewing angles, and
different recording contexts. Our model sets a new state-of-the-art across all
three generalization benchmarks, bringing machine action recognition closer to
human-like robustness. Project page:

*Tung Vu,Lam Nguyen,Quynh Dao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PromptGuard是一个模块化提示框架，通过VulnGuard Prompt技术使用对比学习防止LLM生成有害信息，保护弱势群体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全方法依赖事后过滤或通用对齐技术，无法在生成源头主动防止有害输出，对LGBTQ+、单亲家庭等弱势群体造成风险。

Method: 提出PromptGuard框架，包含VulnGuard Prompt混合技术：整合GitHub精选数据、伦理思维链推理和自适应角色提示，采用多目标优化理论。

Result: 通过熵界和帕累托最优性证明25-30%的分析性伤害减少，建立数学基础验证框架。

Conclusion: PromptGuard提供了一个智能专家系统，通过六个核心模块实现实时伤害预防，为系统性实证研究奠定数学基础。

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in real-world applications
poses unprecedented risks of generating harmful, biased, or misleading
information to vulnerable populations including LGBTQ+ individuals, single
parents, and marginalized communities. While existing safety approaches rely on
post-hoc filtering or generic alignment techniques, they fail to proactively
prevent harmful outputs at the generation source. This paper introduces
PromptGuard, a novel modular prompting framework with our breakthrough
contribution: VulnGuard Prompt, a hybrid technique that prevents harmful
information generation using real-world data-driven contrastive learning.
VulnGuard integrates few-shot examples from curated GitHub repositories,
ethical chain-of-thought reasoning, and adaptive role-prompting to create
population-specific protective barriers. Our framework employs theoretical
multi-objective optimization with formal proofs demonstrating 25-30% analytical
harm reduction through entropy bounds and Pareto optimality. PromptGuard
orchestrates six core modules: Input Classification, VulnGuard Prompting,
Ethical Principles Integration, External Tool Interaction, Output Validation,
and User-System Interaction, creating an intelligent expert system for
real-time harm prevention. We provide comprehensive mathematical formalization
including convergence proofs, vulnerability analysis using information theory,
and theoretical validation framework using GitHub-sourced datasets,
establishing mathematical foundations for systematic empirical research.

### [5] [Similarity-based Outlier Detection for Noisy Object Re-Identification Using Beta Mixtures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08926)
*Waqar Ahmad,Evan Murphy,Vladimir A. Krylov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Beta-SOD方法，使用Beta混合分布模型检测标签噪声，通过孪生网络架构提升Re-ID在噪声环境下的鲁棒性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目标重识别方法对标签噪声高度敏感，传统方法在噪声环境下性能显著下降，需要开发能够有效处理噪声的鲁棒方法

Method: 将Re-ID重构为监督图像相似性任务，采用孪生网络架构，提出Beta-SOD统计异常检测框架，使用双分量Beta分布混合模型建模嵌入对余弦相似度分布

Result: 在CUHK03、Market-1501和VeRi-776数据集上验证，在10-30%噪声水平下相比现有方法表现更优，展示了在噪声Re-ID场景中的鲁棒性和广泛适用性

Conclusion: Beta-SOD方法通过统计异常检测有效处理Re-ID中的标签噪声问题，结合多种损失函数联合优化特征级相似性学习，为噪声环境下的目标重识别提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Object re-identification (Re-ID) methods are highly sensitive to label noise,
which typically leads to significant performance degradation. We address this
challenge by reframing Re-ID as a supervised image similarity task and adopting
a Siamese network architecture trained to capture discriminative pairwise
relationships. Central to our approach is a novel statistical outlier detection
(OD) framework, termed Beta-SOD (Beta mixture Similarity-based Outlier
Detection), which models the distribution of cosine similarities between
embedding pairs using a two-component Beta distribution mixture model. We
establish a novel identifiability result for mixtures of two Beta
distributions, ensuring that our learning task is well-posed.The proposed OD
step complements the Re-ID architecture combining binary cross-entropy,
contrastive, and cosine embedding losses that jointly optimize feature-level
similarity learning.We demonstrate the effectiveness of Beta-SOD in de-noising
and Re-ID tasks for person Re-ID, on CUHK03 and Market-1501 datasets, and
vehicle Re-ID, on VeRi-776 dataset. Our method shows superior performance
compared to the state-of-the-art methods across various noise levels (10-30\%),
demonstrating both robustness and broad applicability in noisy Re-ID scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SFD-Mamba2Net是一个端到端框架，通过整合多尺度结构先验、状态空间长程依赖建模和频域细节增强策略，显著提高了ICA图像中冠状动脉分割和狭窄检测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 冠状动脉疾病是全球主要死因之一，ICA作为诊断金标准需要精确的血管分割和狭窄检测。但ICA图像具有低对比度、高噪声和复杂细粒度血管结构的特点，现有方法难以满足临床需求。

Method: 提出SFD-Mamba2Net框架：编码器嵌入曲率感知结构增强模块突出管状血管结构；解码器引入渐进高频感知模块，通过多级小波分解逐步细化高频细节并整合低频全局结构。

Result: 在八个分割指标上均优于最先进方法，在狭窄检测中实现了最高的真阳性率和阳性预测值。

Conclusion: 该方法通过结构增强和频域细节优化，有效解决了ICA图像血管分割和狭窄检测的挑战，具有重要的临床应用价值。

Abstract: Background: Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) is one of the leading causes of
death worldwide. Invasive Coronary Angiography (ICA), regarded as the gold
standard for CAD diagnosis, necessitates precise vessel segmentation and
stenosis detection. However, ICA images are typically characterized by low
contrast, high noise levels, and complex, fine-grained vascular structures,
which pose significant challenges to the clinical adoption of existing
segmentation and detection methods. Objective: This study aims to improve the
accuracy of coronary artery segmentation and stenosis detection in ICA images
by integrating multi-scale structural priors, state-space-based long-range
dependency modeling, and frequency-domain detail enhancement strategies.
Methods: We propose SFD-Mamba2Net, an end-to-end framework tailored for
ICA-based vascular segmentation and stenosis detection. In the encoder, a
Curvature-Aware Structural Enhancement (CASE) module is embedded to leverage
multi-scale responses for highlighting slender tubular vascular structures,
suppressing background interference, and directing attention toward vascular
regions. In the decoder, we introduce a Progressive High-Frequency Perception
(PHFP) module that employs multi-level wavelet decomposition to progressively
refine high-frequency details while integrating low-frequency global
structures. Results and Conclusions: SFD-Mamba2Net consistently outperformed
state-of-the-art methods across eight segmentation metrics, and achieved the
highest true positive rate and positive predictive value in stenosis detection.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Colorectal cancer frequently metastasizes to the liver, significantly
reducing long-term survival. While surgical resection is the only potentially
curative treatment for colorectal liver metastasis (CRLM), patient outcomes
vary widely depending on tumor characteristics along with clinical and genomic
factors. Current prognostic models, often based on limited clinical or
molecular features, lack sufficient predictive power, especially in multifocal
CRLM cases. We present a fully automated framework for surgical outcome
prediction from pre- and post-contrast MRI acquired before surgery. Our
framework consists of a segmentation pipeline and a radiomics pipeline. The
segmentation pipeline learns to segment the liver, tumors, and spleen from
partially annotated data by leveraging promptable foundation models to complete
missing labels. Also, we propose SAMONAI, a novel zero-shot 3D prompt
propagation algorithm that leverages the Segment Anything Model to segment 3D
regions of interest from a single point prompt, significantly improving our
segmentation pipeline's accuracy and efficiency. The predicted pre- and
post-contrast segmentations are then fed into our radiomics pipeline, which
extracts features from each tumor and predicts survival using SurvAMINN, a
novel autoencoder-based multiple instance neural network for survival analysis.
SurvAMINN jointly learns dimensionality reduction and hazard prediction from
right-censored survival data, focusing on the most aggressive tumors. Extensive
evaluation on an institutional dataset comprising 227 patients demonstrates
that our framework surpasses existing clinical and genomic biomarkers,
delivering a C-index improvement exceeding 10%. Our results demonstrate the
potential of integrating automated segmentation algorithms and radiomics-based
survival analysis to deliver accurate, annotation-efficient, and interpretable
outcome prediction in CRLM.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CompCon算法通过进化搜索比较不同文本到图像生成模型的视觉表示差异，发现特定提示词触发的视觉属性差异，并构建ID2数据集进行验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究不同文本到图像生成模型在视觉表示上的差异，探索何时以及如何这些模型的输出会产生不同的视觉属性，以理解模型间的表示分歧。

Method: 提出CompCon进化搜索算法，自动发现一个模型输出中更普遍的视觉属性差异，并识别与这些差异相关的提示概念。构建ID2数据集（包含60个输入依赖差异）进行评估。

Result: CompCon能够有效发现模型间的表示差异，例如PixArt在表达孤独的提示中生成湿滑街道，Stable Diffusion 3.5在描述非裔美国人媒体职业时产生特定表征。

Conclusion: CompCon提供了一种系统的方法来比较和理解不同生成模型的视觉表示差异，揭示了模型在特定概念上的表征偏好和偏差。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate when and how visual representations learned by
two different generative models diverge. Given two text-to-image models, our
goal is to discover visual attributes that appear in images generated by one
model but not the other, along with the types of prompts that trigger these
attribute differences. For example, "flames" might appear in one model's
outputs when given prompts expressing strong emotions, while the other model
does not produce this attribute given the same prompts. We introduce CompCon
(Comparing Concepts), an evolutionary search algorithm that discovers visual
attributes more prevalent in one model's output than the other, and uncovers
the prompt concepts linked to these visual differences. To evaluate CompCon's
ability to find diverging representations, we create an automated data
generation pipeline to produce ID2, a dataset of 60 input-dependent
differences, and compare our approach to several LLM- and VLM-powered
baselines. Finally, we use CompCon to compare popular text-to-image models,
finding divergent representations such as how PixArt depicts prompts mentioning
loneliness with wet streets and Stable Diffusion 3.5 depicts African American
people in media professions. Code at: https://github.com/adobe-research/CompCon

Conclusion: 该机器学习方法有效解决了无人机图像中云影和太阳耀光问题，为水质遥感监测提供了可靠的技术支持

Abstract: The use of unmanned aerial systems (UASs) has increased tremendously in the
current decade. They have significantly advanced remote sensing with the
capability to deploy and image the terrain as per required spatial, spectral,
temporal, and radiometric resolutions for various remote sensing applications.
One of the major advantages of UAS imagery is that images can be acquired in
cloudy conditions by flying the UAS under the clouds. The limitation to the
technology is that the imagery is often sullied by cloud shadows. Images taken
over water are additionally affected by sun glint. These are two pose serious
issues for estimating water quality parameters from the UAS images. This study
proposes a novel machine learning approach first to identify and extract
regions with cloud shadows and sun glint and separate such regions from
non-obstructed clear sky regions and sun-glint unaffected regions. The data was
extracted from the images at pixel level to train an U-Net based deep learning
model and best settings for model training was identified based on the various
evaluation metrics from test cases. Using this evaluation, a high-quality image
correction model was determined, which was used to recover the cloud shadow and
sun glint areas in the images.

### [10] [CoSwin: Convolution Enhanced Hierarchical Shifted Window Attention For Small-Scale Vision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08959)
*Puskal Khadka,Rodrigue Rizk,Longwei Wang,KC Santosh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoSwin是一种结合卷积局部特征学习和Swin Transformer全局注意力的混合架构，通过在注意力块中集成可学习的局部特征增强模块，同时捕获细粒度空间细节和全局语义结构，在小规模图像分类数据集上显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers在计算机视觉中取得了显著成果，但过度关注全局上下文往往牺牲了局部特征提取能力，特别是在小数据集上缺乏局部性和平移等变性等关键归纳偏置。

Method: 提出CoSwin架构，将分层移位窗口注意力与局部卷积特征学习相结合，在每个注意力块中集成可学习的局部特征增强模块，实现局部-全局特征融合。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100、MNIST、SVHN和Tiny ImageNet等多个图像分类基准测试中均取得性能提升，相比基线Swin Transformer分别提升2.17%、4.92%、0.10%、0.26%和4.47%。

Conclusion: 局部-全局特征融合有效增强了Transformer在小规模视觉任务中的泛化能力和鲁棒性，证明了结合卷积归纳偏置与自注意力机制的优势。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved impressive results in computer
vision by leveraging self-attention to model long-range dependencies. However,
their emphasis on global context often comes at the expense of local feature
extraction in small datasets, particularly due to the lack of key inductive
biases such as locality and translation equivariance. To mitigate this, we
propose CoSwin, a novel feature-fusion architecture that augments the
hierarchical shifted window attention with localized convolutional feature
learning. Specifically, CoSwin integrates a learnable local feature enhancement
module into each attention block, enabling the model to simultaneously capture
fine-grained spatial details and global semantic structure. We evaluate CoSwin
on multiple image classification benchmarks including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
MNIST, SVHN, and Tiny ImageNet. Our experimental results show consistent
performance gains over state-of-the-art convolutional and transformer-based
models. Notably, CoSwin achieves improvements of 2.17% on CIFAR-10, 4.92% on
CIFAR-100, 0.10% on MNIST, 0.26% on SVHN, and 4.47% on Tiny ImageNet over the
baseline Swin Transformer. These improvements underscore the effectiveness of
local-global feature fusion in enhancing the generalization and robustness of
transformers for small-scale vision. Code and pretrained weights available at

### [11] [iMatcher: Improve matching in point cloud registration via local-to-global geometric consistency learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08982)
*Karim Slimani,Catherine Achard,Brahim Tamadazte*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: iMatcher是一个完全可微的点云配准特征匹配框架，通过局部图嵌入和全局几何一致性学习来预测几何一致的置信度矩阵，在多个数据集上实现了最先进的配准性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决点云配准中特征匹配的挑战，需要开发一个能够同时考虑局部和全局几何一致性的完全可微分框架，以提高配准精度和鲁棒性。

Method: 1) 使用局部图嵌入模块初始化得分矩阵；2) 通过3D空间中的最近邻搜索进行双边源到目标和目标到源匹配的重定位步骤；3) 将配对点特征堆叠并通过全局几何一致性学习来预测点对点匹配概率。

Result: 在KITTI数据集上达到95%-97%的内点率，KITTI-360上94%-97%，3DMatch上最高81.1%，在室外和室内数据集以及6-DoF姿态估计和部分到部分匹配任务中均表现出色。

Conclusion: iMatcher通过结合局部和全局几何一致性学习，显著提升了刚性配准性能，在各种设置下都展现了强大的鲁棒性和最先进的性能表现。

Abstract: This paper presents iMatcher, a fully differentiable framework for feature
matching in point cloud registration. The proposed method leverages learned
features to predict a geometrically consistent confidence matrix, incorporating
both local and global consistency. First, a local graph embedding module leads
to an initialization of the score matrix. A subsequent repositioning step
refines this matrix by considering bilateral source-to-target and
target-to-source matching via nearest neighbor search in 3D space. The paired
point features are then stacked together to be refined through global geometric
consistency learning to predict a point-wise matching probability. Extensive
experiments on real-world outdoor (KITTI, KITTI-360) and indoor (3DMatch)
datasets, as well as on 6-DoF pose estimation (TUD-L) and partial-to-partial
matching (MVP-RG), demonstrate that iMatcher significantly improves rigid
registration performance. The method achieves state-of-the-art inlier ratios,
scoring 95% - 97% on KITTI, 94% - 97% on KITTI-360, and up to 81.1% on 3DMatch,
highlighting its robustness across diverse settings.

TL;DR: 提出UltrON方法，利用超声B模式图像的声学特征进行弱监督优化，改进3D形状重建，解决遮挡和视图依赖性问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于SDF的隐式表示方法依赖精确标注且忽略B模式图像中的丰富声学信息，同时难以处理超声的视图依赖性和声影伪影问题

Method: 采用基于占据率的表示方法，提出UltrON框架，利用B模式图像的声学特征进行弱监督优化，并设计新的损失函数补偿视图依赖性

Conclusion: 该方法通过整合声学特性改进了超声图像的3D形状重建，为更准确的解剖结构重建提供了新途径

Abstract: In free-hand ultrasound imaging, sonographers rely on expertise to mentally
integrate partial 2D views into 3D anatomical shapes. Shape reconstruction can
assist clinicians in this process. Central to this task is the choice of shape
representation, as it determines how accurately and efficiently the structure
can be visualized, analyzed, and interpreted. Implicit representations, such as
SDF and occupancy function, offer a powerful alternative to traditional voxel-
or mesh-based methods by modeling continuous, smooth surfaces with compact
storage, avoiding explicit discretization. Recent studies demonstrate that SDF
can be effectively optimized using annotations derived from segmented B-mode
ultrasound images. Yet, these approaches hinge on precise annotations,
overlooking the rich acoustic information embedded in B-mode intensity.
Moreover, implicit representation approaches struggle with the ultrasound's
view-dependent nature and acoustic shadowing artifacts, which impair
reconstruction. To address the problems resulting from occlusions and
annotation dependency, we propose an occupancy-based representation and
introduce \gls{UltrON} that leverages acoustic features to improve geometric
consistency in weakly-supervised optimization regime. We show that these
features can be obtained from B-mode images without additional annotation cost.
Moreover, we propose a novel loss function that compensates for view-dependency
in the B-mode images and facilitates occupancy optimization from multiview
ultrasound. By incorporating acoustic properties, \gls{UltrON} generalizes to
shapes of the same anatomy. We show that \gls{UltrON} mitigates the limitations
of occlusions and sparse labeling and paves the way for more accurate 3D
reconstruction. Code and dataset will be available at

Abstract: Automatic quantification of intramyocardial motion and strain from tagging
MRI remains an important but challenging task. We propose a method using
implicit neural representations (INRs), conditioned on learned latent codes, to
predict continuous left ventricular (LV) displacement -- without requiring

achieved the best tracking accuracy (2.14 mm RMSE) and the lowest combined
error in global circumferential (2.86%) and radial (6.42%) strain compared to
three deep learning baselines. In addition, our method is $\sim$380$\times$
faster than the most accurate baseline. These results highlight the suitability
of INR-based models for accurate and scalable analysis of myocardial strain in
large CMR datasets.

detection under real-world conditions. Traditional closed-set detectors degrade
significantly under domain shifts and flight data corruption, posing risks to
safety-critical applications. We propose a novel, model-agnostic open-set
detection framework designed specifically for embedding-based detectors. The
method explicitly handles unknown object rejection while maintaining robustness
against corrupted flight data. It estimates semantic uncertainty via entropy
modeling in the embedding space and incorporates spectral normalization and
temperature scaling to enhance open-set discrimination. We validate our
approach on the challenging AOT aerial benchmark and through extensive
real-world flight tests. Comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate consistent
improvements over baseline methods, achieving up to a 10\% relative AUROC gain
compared to standard YOLO-based detectors. Additionally, we show that
background rejection further strengthens robustness without compromising
detection accuracy, making our solution particularly well-suited for reliable
UAV perception in dynamic air-to-air environments.

*Samuel Felipe dos Santos,Tiago Agostinho de Almeida,Jurandy Almeida*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了增强型互学习网络(E-MLNet)，通过动态加权策略改进通用域自适应，在多个基准测试中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的通用域自适应方法如MLNet对所有分类器同等对待，导致学习信号稀释，需要更精确的边界区分机制。

Method: E-MLNet集成动态加权策略到开放集熵最小化(OEM)中，利用闭集分类器预测，针对每个目标样本聚焦最相关的类别边界。

Result: 在四个基准测试(Office-31、Office-Home、VisDA-2017、ImageCLEF)上取得最佳平均H分数，在31个任务中22个开放部分DA和19个开放集DA任务上超越MLNet基线。

Conclusion: 动态加权策略有效提升了已知和未知类别的区分能力，证明了聚焦自适应策略的优越性。

Abstract: Universal Domain Adaptation (UniDA) seeks to transfer knowledge from a
labeled source to an unlabeled target domain without assuming any relationship
between their label sets, requiring models to classify known samples while
rejecting unknown ones. Advanced methods like Mutual Learning Network (MLNet)
use a bank of one-vs-all classifiers adapted via Open-set Entropy Minimization
(OEM). However, this strategy treats all classifiers equally, diluting the
learning signal. We propose the Enhanced Mutual Learning Network (E-MLNet),
which integrates a dynamic weighting strategy to OEM. By leveraging the
closed-set classifier's predictions, E-MLNet focuses adaptation on the most
relevant class boundaries for each target sample, sharpening the distinction
between known and unknown classes. We conduct extensive experiments on four
challenging benchmarks: Office-31, Office-Home, VisDA-2017, and ImageCLEF. The
results demonstrate that E-MLNet achieves the highest average H-scores on VisDA
and ImageCLEF and exhibits superior robustness over its predecessor. E-MLNet
outperforms the strong MLNet baseline in the majority of individual adaptation
tasks -- 22 out of 31 in the challenging Open-Partial DA setting and 19 out of
31 in the Open-Set DA setting -- confirming the benefits of our focused
adaptation strategy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人为错误是道路交通事故的主要原因，特别是分心和障碍驾驶，需要有效的监测技术

Method: 采用YOLO物体检测模型和自定义车道估计算法，通过实时物体跟踪、侧向位移分析和车道位置监测来识别不安全驾驶行为

Result: 在多样化视频数据集上的实验评估证明了该框架在不同路面和环境条件下的可靠性和适应性

Conclusion: 该视觉基于方法能够分析非连接车辆的行为，为道路安全监测提供了一种有效的解决方案

Abstract: Road traffic accidents remain a significant global concern, with human error,
particularly distracted and impaired driving, among the leading causes. This
study introduces a novel driver behavior classification system that uses
external observation techniques to detect indicators of distraction and
impairment. The proposed framework employs advanced computer vision
methodologies, including real-time object tracking, lateral displacement
analysis, and lane position monitoring. The system identifies unsafe driving
behaviors such as excessive lateral movement and erratic trajectory patterns by
implementing the YOLO object detection model and custom lane estimation
algorithms. Unlike systems reliant on inter-vehicular communication, this
vision-based approach enables behavioral analysis of non-connected vehicles.
Experimental evaluations on diverse video datasets demonstrate the framework's
reliability and adaptability across varying road and environmental conditions.

TL;DR: 基于MS COCO构建的大规模乌尔都语图片描述数据集COCO-Urdu，包含5.9万张图片和31.9万条高质量乌尔都语描述，以填补乌尔都语在多模态视觉-语言研究中的空白


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乌尔都语作为有2.5亿使用者的语言，在多模态和视觉-语言研究中严重缺乏大规模高质量数据集，导致多语言视觉-语言模型存在语言偏见

Method: 通过分层抽样从MS COCO数据集选取图片，使用SeamlessM4T v2进行翻译，构建混合多模态质量估计框架（COMET-Kiwi、CLIP相似性、BERTScore等）进行质量验证，使用开源大语言模型迭代精炼低分描述

Result: 创建了目前公开可用的最大乌尔都语标题数据集，在BLEU、SacreBLEU和chrF指标上都获得了一致且突出的结果

Conclusion: COCO-Urdu数据集和质量估计流程的发布有助于减少多模态研究中的语言偏见，为建立包容性的视觉-语言系统奠定基础

Abstract: Urdu, spoken by over 250 million people, remains critically under-served in
multimodal and vision-language research. The absence of large-scale,
high-quality datasets has limited the development of Urdu-capable systems and
reinforced biases in multilingual vision-language models trained primarily on
high-resource languages. To address this gap, we present COCO-Urdu, a
large-scale image-caption dataset derived from MS COCO, containing 59,000
images and 319,000 Urdu captions selected through stratified sampling to
preserve the original distribution. Captions were translated using SeamlessM4T
v2 and validated with a hybrid multimodal quality estimation framework that
integrates COMET-Kiwi for translation quality, CLIP-based similarity for visual
grounding, and BERTScore with back-translation for semantic consistency;
low-scoring captions were iteratively refined using open-source large language
models. We further benchmark COCO-Urdu on BLEU, SacreBLEU, and chrF, reporting
consistently strong results. To the best of our knowledge, COCO-Urdu is the
largest publicly available Urdu captioning dataset. By releasing both the
dataset and the quality estimation pipeline, we aim to reduce language bias in
multimodal research and establish a foundation for inclusive vision-language
systems.

Abstract: Event cameras capture changes in brightness with microsecond precision and
remain reliable under motion blur and challenging illumination, offering clear
advantages for modeling highly dynamic scenes. Yet, their integration with
natural language understanding has received little attention, leaving a gap in
multimodal perception. To address this, we introduce Talk2Event, the first
large-scale benchmark for language-driven object grounding using event data.
Built on real-world driving scenarios, Talk2Event comprises 5,567 scenes,
13,458 annotated objects, and more than 30,000 carefully validated referring
expressions. Each expression is enriched with four structured attributes --
appearance, status, relation to the viewer, and relation to surrounding objects
-- that explicitly capture spatial, temporal, and relational cues. This
attribute-centric design supports interpretable and compositional grounding,
enabling analysis that moves beyond simple object recognition to contextual
reasoning in dynamic environments. We envision Talk2Event as a foundation for
advancing multimodal and temporally-aware perception, with applications
spanning robotics, human-AI interaction, and so on.

Motivation: 3D脑部MRI研究需要检测细微的形态学差异，但现有反事实生成模型缺乏明确的解剖学偏置，无法保持医学相关的细微局部变化。

Method: 提出PCGM模型，通过概率图模块捐据解剖学约束，使用空间二进制掩码标记细微变化区域，并通过3D ControlNet编码和新的反事实去噪UNet生成高质量MRI。

Result: PCGM在多个数据集上生成比基线方法质量更高的结构性脑部MRI，且从反事实图像中提取的脑部测量能够复现疾病对皯层脑区域的细微影响。

Conclusion: PCGM成为使用合成MRI研究细微形态差异的重要里程碑，能够生成解剖学可行的反事实图像。

Abstract: 3D brain MRI studies often examine subtle morphometric differences between
cohorts that are hard to detect visually. Given the high cost of MRI
acquisition, these studies could greatly benefit from image syntheses,
particularly counterfactual image generation, as seen in other domains, such as
computer vision. However, counterfactual models struggle to produce
anatomically plausible MRIs due to the lack of explicit inductive biases to
preserve fine-grained anatomical details. This shortcoming arises from the
training of the models aiming to optimize for the overall appearance of the
images (e.g., via cross-entropy) rather than preserving subtle, yet medically
relevant, local variations across subjects. To preserve subtle variations, we
propose to explicitly integrate anatomical constraints on a voxel-level as
prior into a generative diffusion framework. Called Probabilistic Causal Graph
Model (PCGM), the approach captures anatomical constraints via a probabilistic
graph module and translates those constraints into spatial binary masks of
regions where subtle variations occur. The masks (encoded by a 3D extension of
ControlNet) constrain a novel counterfactual denoising UNet, whose encodings
are then transferred into high-quality brain MRIs via our 3D diffusion decoder.
Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that PCGM generates
structural brain MRIs of higher quality than several baseline approaches.
Furthermore, we show for the first time that brain measurements extracted from
counterfactuals (generated by PCGM) replicate the subtle effects of a disease
on cortical brain regions previously reported in the neuroscience literature.
This achievement is an important milestone in the use of synthetic MRIs in
studies investigating subtle morphological differences.

Conclusion: Med3DInsight为无需人工标注的可扩展多模态3D医学表示学习提供了新范式，显著提升了3D医学图像的理解能力。

Abstract: Understanding 3D medical image volumes is critical in the medical field, yet
existing 3D medical convolution and transformer-based self-supervised learning
(SSL) methods often lack deep semantic comprehension. Recent advancements in
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) provide a promising approach to
enhance image understanding through text descriptions. To leverage these 2D
MLLMs for improved 3D medical image understanding, we propose Med3DInsight, a
novel pretraining framework that integrates 3D image encoders with 2D MLLMs via
a specially designed plane-slice-aware transformer module. Additionally, our
model employs a partial optimal transport based alignment, demonstrating
greater tolerance to noise introduced by potential noises in LLM-generated
content. Med3DInsight introduces a new paradigm for scalable multimodal 3D
medical representation learning without requiring human annotations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate our state-of-the-art performance on two downstream
tasks, i.e., segmentation and classification, across various public datasets
with CT and MRI modalities, outperforming current SSL methods. Med3DInsight can
be seamlessly integrated into existing 3D medical image understanding networks,
potentially enhancing their performance. Our source code, generated datasets,

Abstract: Recent graph convolutional neural networks (GCNs) have shown high performance
in the field of human action recognition by using human skeleton poses.
However, it fails to detect human-object interaction cases successfully due to
the lack of effective representation of the scene information and appropriate
learning architectures. In this context, we propose a methodology to utilize
human action recognition performance by considering fixed object information in
the environment and following a multi-task learning approach. In order to
evaluate the proposed method, we collected real data from public environments
and prepared our data set, which includes interaction classes of hands-on fixed
objects (e.g., ATM ticketing machines, check-in/out machines, etc.) and
non-interaction classes of walking and standing. The multi-task learning
approach, along with interaction area information, succeeds in recognizing the
studied interaction and non-interaction actions with an accuracy of 99.25%,
outperforming the accuracy of the base model using only human skeleton poses by
2.75%.

Conclusion: IRDFusion框架通过迭代反馈放大显著关系信号并压制特征噪声，实现了高质量的跨模态融合，显示了其稳健性和有效性

Abstract: Current multispectral object detection methods often retain extraneous
background or noise during feature fusion, limiting perceptual performance.To
address this, we propose an innovative feature fusion framework based on
cross-modal feature contrastive and screening strategy, diverging from
conventional approaches. The proposed method adaptively enhances salient
structures by fusing object-aware complementary cross-modal features while
suppressing shared background interference.Our solution centers on two novel,
specially designed modules: the Mutual Feature Refinement Module (MFRM) and the
Differential Feature Feedback Module (DFFM). The MFRM enhances intra- and
inter-modal feature representations by modeling their relationships, thereby
improving cross-modal alignment and discriminative power.Inspired by feedback
differential amplifiers, the DFFM dynamically computes inter-modal differential
features as guidance signals and feeds them back to the MFRM, enabling adaptive
fusion of complementary information while suppressing common-mode noise across
modalities. To enable robust feature learning, the MFRM and DFFM are integrated
into a unified framework, which is formally formulated as an Iterative
Relation-Map Differential Guided Feature Fusion mechanism, termed IRDFusion.
IRDFusion enables high-quality cross-modal fusion by progressively amplifying
salient relational signals through iterative feedback, while suppressing
feature noise, leading to significant performance gains.In extensive
experiments on FLIR, LLVIP and M$^3$FD datasets, IRDFusion achieves
state-of-the-art performance and consistently outperforms existing methods
across diverse challenging scenarios, demonstrating its robustness and
effectiveness. Code will be available at

Conclusion: SQAP-VLA是第一个能够同时实现最先进量化和token剪枝的结构化、无需训练的VLA推理加速框架，有效解决了现有方法的不兼容问题。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models exhibit unprecedented capabilities for
embodied intelligence. However, their extensive computational and memory costs
hinder their practical deployment. Existing VLA compression and acceleration
approaches conduct quantization or token pruning in an ad-hoc manner but fail
to enable both for a holistic efficiency improvement due to an observed
incompatibility. This work introduces SQAP-VLA, the first structured,
training-free VLA inference acceleration framework that simultaneously enables
state-of-the-art quantization and token pruning. We overcome the
incompatibility by co-designing the quantization and token pruning pipeline,
where we propose new quantization-aware token pruning criteria that work on an
aggressively quantized model while improving the quantizer design to enhance
pruning effectiveness. When applied to standard VLA models, SQAP-VLA yields
significant gains in computational efficiency and inference speed while
successfully preserving core model performance, achieving a $\times$1.93
speedup and up to a 4.5\% average success rate enhancement compared to the
original model.

Abstract: LiDAR-based global localization is an essential component of simultaneous
localization and mapping (SLAM), which helps loop closure and re-localization.
Current approaches rely on ground-truth poses obtained from GPS or SLAM
odometry to supervise network training. Despite the great success of these
supervised approaches, substantial cost and effort are required for
high-precision ground-truth pose acquisition. In this work, we propose
S-BEVLoc, a novel self-supervised framework based on bird's-eye view (BEV) for
LiDAR global localization, which eliminates the need for ground-truth poses and
is highly scalable. We construct training triplets from single BEV images by
leveraging the known geographic distances between keypoint-centered BEV
patches. Convolutional neural network (CNN) is used to extract local features,
and NetVLAD is employed to aggregate global descriptors. Moreover, we introduce
SoftCos loss to enhance learning from the generated triplets. Experimental
results on the large-scale KITTI and NCLT datasets show that S-BEVLoc achieves
state-of-the-art performance in place recognition, loop closure, and global
localization tasks, while offering scalability that would require extra effort
for supervised approaches.

Motivation: 基础分割模型虽能零样本提取叶片实例，但分割包含多个重叠叶片的完整植物个体仍然困难，这需要物种特定的标注数据集和大量人工劳动。

Method: 结合基础分割模型提取叶片实例和视觉语言模型推理植物结构，无需额外训练即可提取植物个体。

Conclusion: ZeroPlantSeg提供了一种有效的零样本植物个体分割解决方案，减少了标注需求并实现了良好的跨域适应性。

Abstract: Foundation segmentation models achieve reasonable leaf instance extraction
from top-view crop images without training (i.e., zero-shot). However,
segmenting entire plant individuals with each consisting of multiple
overlapping leaves remains challenging. This problem is referred to as a
hierarchical segmentation task, typically requiring annotated training
datasets, which are often species-specific and require notable human labor. To
address this, we introduce ZeroPlantSeg, a zero-shot segmentation for
rosette-shaped plant individuals from top-view images. We integrate a
foundation segmentation model, extracting leaf instances, and a vision-language
model, reasoning about plants' structures to extract plant individuals without
additional training. Evaluations on datasets with multiple plant species,
growth stages, and shooting environments demonstrate that our method surpasses
existing zero-shot methods and achieves better cross-domain performance than
supervised methods. Implementations are available at

Abstract: Although Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) exhibits strong
performance across diverse vision tasks, its application to person
representation learning faces two critical challenges: (i) the scarcity of
large-scale annotated vision-language data focused on person-centric images,
and (ii) the inherent limitations of global contrastive learning, which
struggles to maintain discriminative local features crucial for fine-grained
matching while remaining vulnerable to noisy text tokens. This work advances
CLIP for person representation learning through synergistic improvements in
data curation and model architecture. First, we develop a noise-resistant data
construction pipeline that leverages the in-context learning capabilities of
MLLMs to automatically filter and caption web-sourced images. This yields
WebPerson, a large-scale dataset of 5M high-quality person-centric image-text
pairs. Second, we introduce the GA-DMS (Gradient-Attention Guided Dual-Masking
Synergetic) framework, which improves cross-modal alignment by adaptively
masking noisy textual tokens based on the gradient-attention similarity score.
Additionally, we incorporate masked token prediction objectives that compel the
model to predict informative text tokens, enhancing fine-grained semantic
representation learning. Extensive experiments show that GA-DMS achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.

*Bin Huang,Kang Chen,Bingxuan Li,Huafeng Liu,Qiegen Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ALL-PET是一个低资源、低样本的PET投影域基础模型，通过潜在扩散模型和三项创新技术，仅用500个样本就能实现高质量sinogram生成，并在多种PET任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决PET成像中标注数据有限和计算资源不足的问题，克服数据稀缺和效率限制，构建大规模基础模型。

Method: 采用潜在扩散模型(LDM)，包含三项关键技术：1)Radon掩码增强策略(RMAS)生成20万+多样化训练样本；2)正负掩码约束确保几何一致性；3)透明医学注意力(TMA)机制增强病灶相关区域。

Result: 仅用500个样本就实现了高质量的sinogram生成，性能可与大数据集训练模型相媲美，内存使用低于24GB，在低剂量重建、衰减校正、延迟帧预测和示踪剂分离等任务中均表现良好。

Conclusion: ALL-PET成功解决了PET成像中的数据稀缺问题，提供了一个高效、可解释且任务自适应的基础模型框架，为医学影像分析提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Building large-scale foundation model for PET imaging is hindered by limited
access to labeled data and insufficient computational resources. To overcome
data scarcity and efficiency limitations, we propose ALL-PET, a low-resource,
low-shot PET foundation model operating directly in the projection domain.
ALL-PET leverages a latent diffusion model (LDM) with three key innovations.
First, we design a Radon mask augmentation strategy (RMAS) that generates over
200,000 structurally diverse training samples by projecting randomized
image-domain masks into sinogram space, significantly improving generalization
with minimal data. This is extended by a dynamic multi-mask (DMM) mechanism
that varies mask quantity and distribution, enhancing data diversity without
added model complexity. Second, we implement positive/negative mask constraints
to embed strict geometric consistency, reducing parameter burden while
preserving generation quality. Third, we introduce transparent medical
attention (TMA), a parameter-free, geometry-driven mechanism that enhances
lesion-related regions in raw projection data. Lesion-focused attention maps
are derived from coarse segmentation, covering both hypermetabolic and
hypometabolic areas, and projected into sinogram space for physically
consistent guidance. The system supports clinician-defined ROI adjustments,
ensuring flexible, interpretable, and task-adaptive emphasis aligned with PET
acquisition physics. Experimental results show ALL-PET achieves high-quality
sinogram generation using only 500 samples, with performance comparable to
models trained on larger datasets. ALL-PET generalizes across tasks including
low-dose reconstruction, attenuation correction, delayed-frame prediction, and
tracer separation, operating efficiently with memory use under 24GB.

*Dylan Peek,Matthew P. Skerritt,Stephan Chalup*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 神经网络在噪声环境下预测Betti数的性能优于传统的持续同调方法，能够学习上下文和几何先验信息


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 比较持续同调(PH)和人工神经网络(ANN)在从数据推断拓扑结构方面的噪声鲁棒性，探索ANN在拓扑估计中的潜力

Method: 使用监督神经网络预测2D二值图像的Betti数，与基于立方复形和符号欧几里得距离变换(SEDT)的PH流程进行对比，在一个合成数据集和两个真实数据集上进行测试

Result: ANN在噪声条件下表现优于PH方法，主要得益于其从训练数据中学习上下文和几何先验的能力

Conclusion: 尽管仍处于发展初期，但ANN为结构噪声下的拓扑估计提供了一个有吸引力的替代PH的方法

Abstract: Persistent Homology (PH) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) offer
contrasting approaches to inferring topological structure from data. In this
study, we examine the noise robustness of a supervised neural network trained
to predict Betti numbers in 2D binary images. We compare an ANN approach
against a PH pipeline based on cubical complexes and the Signed Euclidean
Distance Transform (SEDT), which is a widely adopted strategy for noise-robust
topological analysis. Using one synthetic and two real-world datasets, we show
that ANNs can outperform this PH approach under noise, likely due to their
capacity to learn contextual and geometric priors from training data. Though
still emerging, the use of ANNs for topology estimation offers a compelling
alternative to PH under structural noise.

Motivation: 现有综述大多按任务或模型家族分类，忽视了数据集对架构演化的结构性影响。本文旨在填补这一空白，通过数据集驱动的视角重新解读视频理解模型的发展历程。

Method: 采用数据集驱动分析方法，从运动复杂度、时间跨度、层次组合和多模态丰富性四个维度分析数据集特征，并重新解读从双流网络、3D CNN到序列模型、Transformer和多模态基础模型的发展历程。

Result: 建立了数据集、归纳偏置和架构的统一框架，将视频理解里程碑模型重新解释为对数据集驱动压力的具体响应，提供了模型设计与数据集不变性对齐的实用指南。

Conclusion: 通过将数据集、归纳偏置和架构统一到连贯框架中，本综述不仅提供了全面的回顾，还为推进通用视频理解提供了规范性路线图，强调了在可扩展性和任务需求之间平衡的重要性。

Abstract: Video understanding has advanced rapidly, fueled by increasingly complex
datasets and powerful architectures. Yet existing surveys largely classify
models by task or family, overlooking the structural pressures through which
datasets guide architectural evolution. This survey is the first to adopt a
dataset-driven perspective, showing how motion complexity, temporal span,
hierarchical composition, and multimodal richness impose inductive biases that
models should encode. We reinterpret milestones, from two-stream and 3D CNNs to
sequential, transformer, and multimodal foundation models, as concrete
responses to these dataset-driven pressures. Building on this synthesis, we
offer practical guidance for aligning model design with dataset invariances
while balancing scalability and task demands. By unifying datasets, inductive
biases, and architectures into a coherent framework, this survey provides both
a comprehensive retrospective and a prescriptive roadmap for advancing
general-purpose video understanding.

Motivation: 病理学家在检查全玻片图像时会在不同放大倍数间切换，以评估组织形态和细胞细节，但现有深度学习模型难以模拟这种行为并学习不同尺度结构间的相互依赖语义。

Method: 创建包含6个器官、673对标注的多尺度重叠细胞检测和组织分割数据集，来自306个TCGA H&E染色全玻片图像，分为训练、验证和测试集，邀请社区参与模型开发。

Result: 参与者提出的模型显著增强了对细胞-组织关系的理解，最佳模型在测试集上相比不包含细胞-组织关系的基线细胞检测模型F1分数提升达7.99。

Conclusion: 细胞-组织关系的理解对于实现人类水平性能至关重要，多尺度语义的融入显著优于传统仅细胞检测方法，推动了该领域研究进展。

Abstract: Pathologists routinely alternate between different magnifications when
examining Whole-Slide Images, allowing them to evaluate both broad tissue
morphology and intricate cellular details to form comprehensive diagnoses.
However, existing deep learning-based cell detection models struggle to
replicate these behaviors and learn the interdependent semantics between
structures at different magnifications. A key barrier in the field is the lack
of datasets with multi-scale overlapping cell and tissue annotations. The
OCELOT 2023 challenge was initiated to gather insights from the community to
validate the hypothesis that understanding cell and tissue (cell-tissue)
interactions is crucial for achieving human-level performance, and to
accelerate the research in this field. The challenge dataset includes
overlapping cell detection and tissue segmentation annotations from six organs,
comprising 673 pairs sourced from 306 The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
Whole-Slide Images with hematoxylin and eosin staining, divided into training,
validation, and test subsets. Participants presented models that significantly
enhanced the understanding of cell-tissue relationships. Top entries achieved
up to a 7.99 increase in F1-score on the test set compared to the baseline
cell-only model that did not incorporate cell-tissue relationships. This is a
substantial improvement in performance over traditional cell-only detection
methods, demonstrating the need for incorporating multi-scale semantics into
the models. This paper provides a comparative analysis of the methods used by
participants, highlighting innovative strategies implemented in the OCELOT 2023
challenge.

TL;DR: RT-DETR++通过改进RT-DETR的编码器，引入通道门控注意力上采样/下采样机制和CSP-PAC特征融合技术，在无人机图像小目标检测中实现优越性能，同时保持实时检测速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人机图像中的目标检测面临小目标密集、尺度变化大、遮挡严重等挑战，需要开发既能保持高精度又能实时运行的检测模型。

Method: 1. 引入通道门控注意力机制的双路径上采样/下采样(AU/AD)系统，减少特征传播误差并保留细节；2. 在特征融合阶段采用CSP-PAC技术，使用并行空洞卷积在同一层处理局部和上下文信息，实现多尺度特征融合。

Result: 新设计的neck结构在小目标和密集目标检测方面表现出优越性能，模型在保持实时检测速度的同时不增加计算复杂度。

Conclusion: 本研究为实时检测系统中的特征编码设计提供了有效方法，特别适用于无人机图像中的小目标检测任务。

Abstract: Object detection in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery presents
significant challenges. Issues such as densely packed small objects, scale
variations, and occlusion are commonplace. This paper introduces RT-DETR++,
which enhances the encoder component of the RT-DETR model. Our improvements
focus on two key aspects. First, we introduce a channel-gated attention-based
upsampling/downsampling (AU/AD) mechanism. This dual-path system minimizes
errors and preserves details during feature layer propagation. Second, we
incorporate CSP-PAC during feature fusion. This technique employs parallel
hollow convolutions to process local and contextual information within the same
layer, facilitating the integration of multi-scale features. Evaluation
demonstrates that our novel neck design achieves superior performance in
detecting small and densely packed objects. The model maintains sufficient
speed for real-time detection without increasing computational complexity. This
study provides an effective approach for feature encoding design in real-time
detection systems.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种无需训练的知识聚焦框架，通过提取关键知识、消除冗余信息和选择性整合策略，有效提升了知识基于视觉问答的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KB-VQA方法直接使用摘要的知识会引入大量噪声和冗余信息，影响回答准确性。

Method: 1. 从图片-问题对中提取关键部分构建低噪声查询 2. 使用大模型识别和提取有益知识段落 3. 采用选择性知识整合策略，仅在模型信心不足时使用知识

Result: 实验结果显示该框架在性能上超过了现有最先进方法

Conclusion: 通过知识聚焦和冗余消除策略，可以获得更准确和关键的知识，提升KB-VQA的表现。

Abstract: Knowledge-based visual question answering (KB-VQA) requires a model to
understand images and utilize external knowledge to provide accurate answers.
Existing approaches often directly augment models with retrieved information
from knowledge sources while ignoring substantial knowledge redundancy, which
introduces noise into the answering process. To address this, we propose a
training-free framework with knowledge focusing for KB-VQA, that mitigates the
impact of noise by enhancing knowledge relevance and reducing redundancy.
First, for knowledge retrieval, our framework concludes essential parts from
the image-question pairs, creating low-noise queries that enhance the retrieval
of highly relevant knowledge. Considering that redundancy still persists in the
retrieved knowledge, we then prompt large models to identify and extract
answer-beneficial segments from knowledge. In addition, we introduce a
selective knowledge integration strategy, allowing the model to incorporate
knowledge only when it lacks confidence in answering the question, thereby
mitigating the influence of redundant information. Our framework enables the
acquisition of accurate and critical knowledge, and extensive experiments
demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱遥感技术在地物分类中具有重要应用价值，但存在波段多、维度高、光谱混合等导致的特征冗余问题，需要新的方法来突破传统分类方法的性能瓶颈

Method: 使用ZY1F卫星高光谱图像，提出CWSSNet框架，集成3D光谱空间特征和小波卷积，采用多尺度卷积注意力模块融合多模态信息，引入小波域多波段分解和卷积操作

Result: 在余干县取得mIoU 74.50%、mAcc 82.73%、mF1 84.94%的优异结果，在水体、植被和裸地分类中获得最高IoU，70%训练集比例下训练时间增加有限且分类效果接近最优

Conclusion: CWSSNet模型具有良好的鲁棒性，在小样本训练条件下保持可靠性能，有效解决了高光谱图像特征冗余问题，突破了传统分类方法的性能瓶颈

Abstract: Hyperspectral remote sensing technology has significant application value in
fields such as forestry ecology and precision agriculture, while also putting
forward higher requirements for fine ground object classification. However,
although hyperspectral images are rich in spectral information and can improve
recognition accuracy, they tend to cause prominent feature redundancy due to
their numerous bands, high dimensionality, and spectral mixing characteristics.
To address this, this study used hyperspectral images from the ZY1F satellite
as a data source and selected Yugan County, Shangrao City, Jiangxi Province as
the research area to perform ground object classification research. A
classification framework named CWSSNet was proposed, which integrates 3D
spectral-spatial features and wavelet convolution. This framework integrates
multimodal information us-ing a multiscale convolutional attention module and
breaks through the classification performance bottleneck of traditional methods
by introducing multi-band decomposition and convolution operations in the
wavelet domain. The experiments showed that CWSSNet achieved 74.50\%, 82.73\%,
and 84.94\% in mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), mean Accuracy (mAcc), and
mean F1-score (mF1) respectively in Yugan County. It also obtained the highest
Intersection over Union (IoU) in the classifica-tion of water bodies,
vegetation, and bare land, demonstrating good robustness. Additionally, when
the training set proportion was 70\%, the increase in training time was
limited, and the classification effect was close to the optimal level,
indicating that the model maintains reliable performance under small-sample
training conditions.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of generative models, highly realistic image

Although AI-generated image detection methods have partially addressed these
concerns, a substantial research gap remains in evaluating their performance
under complex real-world conditions. This paper introduces the Real-World
Robustness Dataset (RRDataset) for comprehensive evaluation of detection models
across three dimensions: 1) Scenario Generalization: RRDataset encompasses
high-quality images from seven major scenarios (War and Conflict, Disasters and
Accidents, Political and Social Events, Medical and Public Health, Culture and
Religion, Labor and Production, and everyday life), addressing existing dataset
gaps from a content perspective. 2) Internet Transmission Robustness: examining
detector performance on images that have undergone multiple rounds of sharing
across various social media platforms. 3) Re-digitization Robustness: assessing
model effectiveness on images altered through four distinct re-digitization
methods. We benchmarked 17 detectors and 10 vision-language models (VLMs) on
RRDataset and conducted a large-scale human study involving 192 participants to
investigate human few-shot learning capabilities in detecting AI-generated

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种轻量级自适应性Dark-ISP插件，直接处理Bayer RAW图像来改善低光环境下的目标检测性能。通过将传统ISP流程解构为可微分组件并使用任务驱动优化，该方法在三个RAW数据集上超越了现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低光环境下的目标检测面临图像质量恶化挑战。虽然RAW图像比RGB图像更有潜力，但现有方法或者使用有信息损失的RAW-RGB图像，或者采用复杂框架。

Method: 提出轻量级自适应性Dark-ISP插件：1）将传统ISP流程解构为线性传感器校准和非线性音调映射子模块，重构为可微分组件通过任务驱动损失优化；2）利用ISP流程的内在级联结构，设计自成增机制促进子模块协作。

Result: 在三个RAW图像数据集上进行了涉广实验，证明该方法在具有挑战性的低光环境下，以最少的参数量超越了现有的RGB和RAW基于检测方法，获得了更优秀的结果。

Conclusion: Dark-ISP插件能够直接处理Bayer RAW图像，支持无缝端到端训练，通过将ISP流程解构为可优化的可微分组件，实现了与检测目标对齐的自动RAW-to-RGB转换，为低光环境目标检测提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Low-light Object detection is crucial for many real-world applications but
remains challenging due to degraded image quality. While recent studies have
shown that RAW images offer superior potential over RGB images, existing
approaches either use RAW-RGB images with information loss or employ complex
frameworks. To address these, we propose a lightweight and self-adaptive Image
Signal Processing (ISP) plugin, Dark-ISP, which directly processes Bayer RAW
images in dark environments, enabling seamless end-to-end training for object
detection. Our key innovations are: (1) We deconstruct conventional ISP
pipelines into sequential linear (sensor calibration) and nonlinear (tone
mapping) sub-modules, recasting them as differentiable components optimized
through task-driven losses. Each module is equipped with content-aware
adaptability and physics-informed priors, enabling automatic RAW-to-RGB
conversion aligned with detection objectives. (2) By exploiting the ISP
pipeline's intrinsic cascade structure, we devise a Self-Boost mechanism that
facilitates cooperation between sub-modules. Through extensive experiments on
three RAW image datasets, we demonstrate that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art RGB- and RAW-based detection approaches, achieving superior
results with minimal parameters in challenging low-light environments.

Conclusion: 多粒度建模能有效提升目标引导轨迹预测性能，递归精炼和跨粒度特征整合是提升预测准确性的关键技术创新。

Abstract: Accurate human trajectory prediction is crucial for robotics navigation and
autonomous driving. Recent research has demonstrated that incorporating goal
guidance significantly enhances prediction accuracy by reducing uncertainty and
leveraging prior knowledge. Most goal-guided approaches decouple the prediction
task into two stages: goal prediction and subsequent trajectory completion
based on the predicted goal, which operate at extreme granularities:
coarse-grained goal prediction forecasts the overall intention, while
fine-grained trajectory completion needs to generate the positions for all
future timesteps. The potential utility of intermediate temporal granularity
remains largely unexplored, which motivates multi-granularity trajectory
modeling. While prior work has shown that multi-granularity representations
capture diverse scales of human dynamics and motion patterns, effectively
integrating this concept into goal-guided frameworks remains challenging. In
this paper, we propose MGTraj, a novel Multi-Granularity goal-guided model for
human Trajectory prediction. MGTraj recursively encodes trajectory proposals
from coarse to fine granularity levels. At each level, a transformer-based
recursive refinement network (RRN) captures features and predicts progressive
refinements. Features across different granularities are integrated using a
weight-sharing strategy, and velocity prediction is employed as an auxiliary
task to further enhance performance. Comprehensive experimental results in
EHT/UCY and Stanford Drone Dataset indicate that MGTraj outperforms baseline
methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance among goal-guided methods.

Motivation: 当前医学影像的上下文学习模型无法同时实现高保真预测和全局解剖理解，且缺乏跨任务和跨解剖区域的统一模型，限制了上下文学习在医学影像中的潜力。

Method: 采用多尺度自回归上下文学习框架，从粗到细逐步细化预测，生成全分辨率体积输出；提出块状交叉注意力模块，在保持计算效率的同时促进上下文与目标输入之间的长程交互。

Conclusion: Medverse展示了上下文学习在医学影像分析中的巨大潜力，为通用医学图像处理提供了一个统一的解决方案，代码和模型权重将公开提供。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) offers a promising paradigm for universal medical
image analysis, enabling models to perform diverse image processing tasks
without retraining. However, current ICL models for medical imaging remain
limited in two critical aspects: they cannot simultaneously achieve
high-fidelity predictions and global anatomical understanding, and there is no
unified model trained across diverse medical imaging tasks (e.g., segmentation
and enhancement) and anatomical regions. As a result, the full potential of ICL
in medical imaging remains underexplored. Thus, we present \textbf{Medverse}, a
universal ICL model for 3D medical imaging, trained on 22 datasets covering
diverse tasks in universal image segmentation, transformation, and enhancement
across multiple organs, imaging modalities, and clinical centers. Medverse
employs a next-scale autoregressive in-context learning framework that
progressively refines predictions from coarse to fine, generating consistent,
full-resolution volumetric outputs and enabling multi-scale anatomical
awareness. We further propose a blockwise cross-attention module that
facilitates long-range interactions between context and target inputs while
preserving computational efficiency through spatial sparsity. Medverse is
extensively evaluated on a broad collection of held-out datasets covering
previously unseen clinical centers, organs, species, and imaging modalities.
Results demonstrate that Medverse substantially outperforms existing ICL
baselines and establishes a novel paradigm for in-context learning. Code and
model weights will be made publicly available. Our model are publicly available
at https://github.com/jiesihu/Medverse.

Abstract: Background and objective Early diagnosis of gastric diseases is crucial to
prevent fatal outcomes. Although histopathologic examination remains the
diagnostic gold standard, it is performed entirely manually, making evaluations
labor-intensive and prone to variability among pathologists. Critical findings
may be missed, and lack of standard procedures reduces consistency. These
limitations highlight the need for automated, reliable, and efficient methods
for gastric tissue analysis. Methods In this study, a novel hybrid model named
CoAtNeXt was proposed for the classification of gastric tissue images. The
model is built upon the CoAtNet architecture by replacing its MBConv layers
with enhanced ConvNeXtV2 blocks. Additionally, the Convolutional Block
Attention Module (CBAM) is integrated to improve local feature extraction
through channel and spatial attention mechanisms. The architecture was scaled
to achieve a balance between computational efficiency and classification
performance. CoAtNeXt was evaluated on two publicly available datasets,
HMU-GC-HE-30K for eight-class classification and GasHisSDB for binary
classification, and was compared against 10 Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) and ten Vision Transformer (ViT) models. Results CoAtNeXt achieved
96.47% accuracy, 96.60% precision, 96.47% recall, 96.45% F1 score, and 99.89%
AUC on HMU-GC-HE-30K. On GasHisSDB, it reached 98.29% accuracy, 98.07%
precision, 98.41% recall, 98.23% F1 score, and 99.90% AUC. It outperformed all
CNN and ViT models tested and surpassed previous studies in the literature.
Conclusion Experimental results show that CoAtNeXt is a robust architecture for
histopathological classification of gastric tissue images, providing
performance on binary and multiclass. Its highlights its potential to assist
pathologists by enhancing diagnostic accuracy and reducing workload.

TL;DR: 提出了首个针对全景X射线解读的大规模多模态指令数据集MMOral和评估基准MMOral-Bench，并基于此开发了OralGPT模型，在牙科专业领域显著提升了LVLM的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型视觉语言模型在牙科等专业领域的有效性尚未充分探索，特别是全景X射线由于密集解剖结构和细微病理线索带来的解读挑战，缺乏专门的基准数据集。

Method: 构建了包含20,563张标注图像和130万指令实例的MMOral数据集，涵盖属性提取、报告生成、视觉问答和图像对话等任务类型。基于Qwen2.5-VL-7B进行监督微调开发OralGPT模型。

Result: 评估64个LVLM发现最佳模型GPT-4o仅达到41.45%准确率。OralGPT经过单轮SFT后性能提升24.73%，显著改善了牙科领域的多模态AI能力。

Conclusion: MMOral和OralGPT为智能牙科提供了重要基础，有望推动牙科领域更具临床影响力的多模态AI系统发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated
strong performance on general-purpose medical tasks. However, their
effectiveness in specialized domains such as dentistry remains underexplored.
In particular, panoramic X-rays, a widely used imaging modality in oral
radiology, pose interpretative challenges due to dense anatomical structures
and subtle pathological cues, which are not captured by existing medical
benchmarks or instruction datasets. To this end, we introduce MMOral, the first
large-scale multimodal instruction dataset and benchmark tailored for panoramic
X-ray interpretation. MMOral consists of 20,563 annotated images paired with
1.3 million instruction-following instances across diverse task types,
including attribute extraction, report generation, visual question answering,
and image-grounded dialogue. In addition, we present MMOral-Bench, a
comprehensive evaluation suite covering five key diagnostic dimensions in
dentistry. We evaluate 64 LVLMs on MMOral-Bench and find that even the
best-performing model, i.e., GPT-4o, only achieves 41.45% accuracy, revealing
significant limitations of current models in this domain. To promote the
progress of this specific domain, we also propose OralGPT, which conducts
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) upon Qwen2.5-VL-7B with our meticulously curated
MMOral instruction dataset. Remarkably, a single epoch of SFT yields
substantial performance enhancements for LVLMs, e.g., OralGPT demonstrates a
24.73% improvement. Both MMOral and OralGPT hold significant potential as a
critical foundation for intelligent dentistry and enable more clinically
impactful multimodal AI systems in the dental field. The dataset, model,
benchmark, and evaluation suite are available at

TL;DR: 提出了DATE方法，通过时间戳注入机制和语义引导的时间感知相似性采样策略，增强多模态大语言模型的长视频时序理解能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法采用均匀帧采样和隐式位置编码，难以处理长距离依赖关系，导致关键信息丢失和时序理解能力下降

Method: DATE方法包含时间戳注入机制(TIM)和时序感知相似性采样策略(TASS)，将视频帧嵌入与文本时间戳标记交错构建连续时序参考系统，并采用两阶段算法确保语义相关性和时序覆盖

Result: 在小时级长视频基准测试中取得了最先进的性能，7B模型在某些基准上甚至超过了许多72B模型

Conclusion: DATE方法显著提升了多模态大语言模型的绝对时间理解和关键事件定位能力，为长视频理解提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Long video understanding remains a fundamental challenge for multimodal large
language models (MLLMs), particularly in tasks requiring precise temporal
reasoning and event localization. Existing approaches typically adopt uniform
frame sampling and rely on implicit position encodings to model temporal order.
However, these methods struggle with long-range dependencies, leading to
critical information loss and degraded temporal comprehension. In this paper,
we propose Dynamic Absolute Time Enhancement (DATE) that enhances temporal
awareness in MLLMs through the Timestamp Injection Mechanism (TIM) and a
semantically guided Temporal-Aware Similarity Sampling (TASS) strategy.
Specifically, we interleave video frame embeddings with textual timestamp
tokens to construct a continuous temporal reference system. We further
reformulate the video sampling problem as a vision-language retrieval task and
introduce a two-stage algorithm to ensure both semantic relevance and temporal
coverage: enriching each query into a descriptive caption to better align with
the vision feature, and sampling key event with a similarity-driven temporally
regularized greedy strategy. Our method achieves remarkable improvements w.r.t.
absolute time understanding and key event localization, resulting in
state-of-the-art performance among 7B and 72B models on hour-long video
benchmarks. Particularly, our 7B model even exceeds many 72B models on some
benchmarks.

Motivation: 解决3D医学图像分割中资源消耗大、现有高效模型静态设计缺乏适应性、难以平衡性能与效率的问题

Method: 从冗余模型开始，通过块级剪枝和功能解耦损失迭代剪枝冗余模块，实现动态高效的3D分割

Result: PSP-Seg-S轻量变体在五个数据集上与nnU-Net性能相当，GPU内存减少42-45%，训练时间减少29-48%，参数量减少83-87%

Conclusion: PSP-Seg作为成本效益高且性能优异的替代方案，具有广泛的临床应用潜力

Abstract: 3D medical image segmentation often faces heavy resource and time
consumption, limiting its scalability and rapid deployment in clinical
environments. Existing efficient segmentation models are typically static and
manually designed prior to training, which restricts their adaptability across
diverse tasks and makes it difficult to balance performance with resource
efficiency. In this paper, we propose PSP-Seg, a progressive pruning framework
that enables dynamic and efficient 3D segmentation. PSP-Seg begins with a
redundant model and iteratively prunes redundant modules through a combination
of block-wise pruning and a functional decoupling loss. We evaluate PSP-Seg on
five public datasets, benchmarking it against seven state-of-the-art models and
six efficient segmentation models. Results demonstrate that the lightweight
variant, PSP-Seg-S, achieves performance on par with nnU-Net while reducing GPU
memory usage by 42-45%, training time by 29-48%, and parameter number by 83-87%
across all datasets. These findings underscore PSP-Seg's potential as a
cost-effective yet high-performing alternative for widespread clinical
application.

TL;DR: 通过代码化思维（Code-as-Thought）方法，让视觉-语言模型学会动态选择最优的推理路径（代码推理或直接视觉推理）来提升图表理解能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有图表理解方法的局限性：外部工具方法容易出错且受限于预定工具集，而专业模型通常只采用单一的文本链式思维推理策略，中间步骤难以验证

Method: 提出代码化思维（CaT）方法，将图表视觉信息转换为可验证的符号格式；引入可学习的视觉可编程性概念，让模型动态选择代码推理或直接视觉推理路径；使用双重奖励系统进行强化学习训练

Result: 在多样化的图表理解测试集上展现出强大且稳健的性能

Conclusion: 视觉-语言模型不仅可以学会如何推理，还能动态选择每个任务的最优推理路径，为图表理解领域提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Chart understanding presents a critical test to the reasoning capabilities of
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Prior approaches face critical limitations: some
rely on external tools, making them brittle and constrained by a predefined
toolkit, while others fine-tune specialist models that often adopt a single
reasoning strategy, such as text-based chain-of-thought (CoT). The intermediate
steps of text-based reasoning are difficult to verify, which complicates the
use of reinforcement-learning signals that reward factual accuracy. To address
this, we propose a Code-as-Thought (CaT) approach to represent the visual
information of a chart in a verifiable, symbolic format. Our key insight is
that this strategy must be adaptive: a fixed, code-only implementation
consistently fails on complex charts where symbolic representation is
unsuitable. This finding leads us to introduce Visual Programmability: a
learnable property that determines if a chart-question pair is better solved
with code or direct visual analysis. We implement this concept in an adaptive
framework where a VLM learns to choose between the CaT pathway and a direct
visual reasoning pathway. The selection policy of the model is trained with
reinforcement learning using a novel dual-reward system. This system combines a
data-accuracy reward to ground the model in facts and prevent numerical
hallucination, with a decision reward that teaches the model when to use each
strategy, preventing it from defaulting to a single reasoning mode. Experiments
demonstrate strong and robust performance across diverse chart-understanding
benchmarks. Our work shows that VLMs can be taught not only to reason but also
how to reason, dynamically selecting the optimal reasoning pathway for each
task.

Motivation: 现有的多模态脑MRI分割模型要么局限于固定模态，要么在泛化到新模态时可能丢失模态特异性信息，需要开发能够灵活处理任意可用成像模态的模型。

Method: 在U-net架构中集成模态无关输入通道和模态特定输入通道，通过图像增强方案合成人工MRI模态来训练模态无关组件，增强方案差异化改变病理和健康脑组织外观。

Result: 在包含5种病理类型和8种MRI模态的8个数据库上评估，结果显示该方法既能有效处理训练时见过的模态，也能处理新模态来改进分割效果。

Conclusion: 通过简单的架构修改和图像增强，实现了对任意可用MRI模态的灵活分割处理，保持了处理已知模态的能力同时能够利用新模态提升性能。

Abstract: Segmentation models are important tools for the detection and analysis of
lesions in brain MRI. Depending on the type of brain pathology that is imaged,
MRI scanners can acquire multiple, different image modalities (contrasts). Most
segmentation models for multimodal brain MRI are restricted to fixed modalities
and cannot effectively process new ones at inference. Some models generalize to
unseen modalities but may lose discriminative modality-specific information.
This work aims to develop a model that can perform inference on data that
contain image modalities unseen during training, previously seen modalities,
and heterogeneous combinations of both, thus allowing a user to utilize any
available imaging modalities. We demonstrate this is possible with a simple,
thus practical alteration to the U-net architecture, by integrating a
modality-agnostic input channel or pathway, alongside modality-specific input
channels. To train this modality-agnostic component, we develop an image
augmentation scheme that synthesizes artificial MRI modalities. Augmentations
differentially alter the appearance of pathological and healthy brain tissue to
create artificial contrasts between them while maintaining realistic anatomical
integrity. We evaluate the method using 8 MRI databases that include 5 types of
pathologies (stroke, tumours, traumatic brain injury, multiple sclerosis and
white matter hyperintensities) and 8 modalities (T1, T1+contrast, T2, PD, SWI,
DWI, ADC and FLAIR). The results demonstrate that the approach preserves the
ability to effectively process MRI modalities encountered during training,
while being able to process new, unseen modalities to improve its segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SlotSAR是一种新的SAR图像目标中心学习框架，通过多级特征提取和注意力机制，无需掩码标注即可将目标表征与背景杂波分离，在SAR图像分类中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAR图像中的复杂背景杂波（如地形反射和斑点噪声）与目标具有相似的强度和模式，导致模型提取纠缠或虚假特征，影响目标表征的清晰度。

Method: 提出SlotSAR框架：1）从SARATR-X提取高级语义特征；2）从小波散射网络提取低级散射特征；3）设计多级slot注意力模块整合这些多级特征，增强slot-wise表征的区分性。

Result: 实验结果表明SlotSAR在SAR图像分类中达到了最先进的性能，相比现有的OCL方法能够更好地保留结构细节。

Conclusion: SlotSAR通过多级特征提取和注意力机制有效解决了SAR图像中目标与背景杂波分离的挑战，无需掩码标注即可实现鲁棒的目标表征学习。

Abstract: Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images contain not only targets of interest
but also complex background clutter, including terrain reflections and speckle
noise. In many cases, such clutter exhibits intensity and patterns that
resemble targets, leading models to extract entangled or spurious features.
Such behavior undermines the ability to form clear target representations,
regardless of the classifier. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
object-centric learning (OCL) framework, named SlotSAR, that disentangles
target representations from background clutter in SAR images without mask
annotations. SlotSAR first extracts high-level semantic features from SARATR-X
and low-level scattering features from the wavelet scattering network in order
to obtain complementary multi-level representations for robust target
characterization. We further present a multi-level slot attention module that
integrates these low- and high-level features to enhance slot-wise
representation distinctiveness, enabling effective OCL. Experimental results
demonstrate that SlotSAR achieves state-of-the-art performance in SAR imagery
by preserving structural details compared to existing OCL methods.

Abstract: Materials characterization is fundamental to acquiring materials information,
revealing the processing-microstructure-property relationships that guide
material design and optimization. While multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) have recently shown promise in generative and predictive tasks within
materials science, their capacity to understand real-world characterization
imaging data remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we present MatCha, the
first benchmark for materials characterization image understanding, comprising
1,500 questions that demand expert-level domain expertise. MatCha encompasses
four key stages of materials research comprising 21 distinct tasks, each
designed to reflect authentic challenges faced by materials scientists. Our
evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs on MatCha reveals a significant
performance gap compared to human experts. These models exhibit degradation
when addressing questions requiring higher-level expertise and sophisticated
visual perception. Simple few-shot and chain-of-thought prompting struggle to
alleviate these limitations. These findings highlight that existing MLLMs still
exhibit limited adaptability to real-world materials characterization
scenarios. We hope MatCha will facilitate future research in areas such as new
material discovery and autonomous scientific agents. MatCha is available at

Method: 提出渐进式异构协作感知(PHCP)框架，将问题建模为少样本无监督域适应，在推理时通过自训练适配器动态对齐特征

Result: 在OPV2V数据集上的大量实验表明，PHCP在多样化异构场景中表现强劲，仅使用少量无标签数据就达到与完整数据集训练的SOTA方法相当的性能

Conclusion: PHCP成功证明了在推理时直接处理异构协作感知问题的可行性，无需联合训练，为实际应用提供了实用解决方案

Abstract: Collaborative perception enables vehicles to overcome individual perception
limitations by sharing information, allowing them to see further and through
occlusions. In real-world scenarios, models on different vehicles are often
heterogeneous due to manufacturer variations. Existing methods for
heterogeneous collaborative perception address this challenge by fine-tuning
adapters or the entire network to bridge the domain gap. However, these methods
are impractical in real-world applications, as each new collaborator must
undergo joint training with the ego vehicle on a dataset before inference, or
the ego vehicle stores models for all potential collaborators in advance.
Therefore, we pose a new question: Can we tackle this challenge directly during
inference, eliminating the need for joint training? To answer this, we
introduce Progressive Heterogeneous Collaborative Perception (PHCP), a novel
framework that formulates the problem as few-shot unsupervised domain
adaptation. Unlike previous work, PHCP dynamically aligns features by
self-training an adapter during inference, eliminating the need for labeled
data and joint training. Extensive experiments on the OPV2V dataset demonstrate
that PHCP achieves strong performance across diverse heterogeneous scenarios.
Notably, PHCP achieves performance comparable to SOTA methods trained on the
entire dataset while using only a small amount of unlabeled data.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled strong zero-shot classification
through image-text alignment. Yet, their purely visual inference capabilities
remain under-explored. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of
both language-guided and vision-only image classification with a diverse set of
dual-encoder VLMs, including both well-established and recent models such as
SigLIP 2 and RADIOv2.5. The performance is compared in a standard setup on the
ImageNet-1k validation set and its label-corrected variant. The key factors
affecting accuracy are analysed, including prompt design, class diversity, the
number of neighbours in k-NN, and reference set size. We show that language and
vision offer complementary strengths, with some classes favouring textual
prompts and others better handled by visual similarity. To exploit this
complementarity, we introduce a simple, learning-free fusion method based on
per-class precision that improves classification performance. The code is

Conclusion: 预训练数据与目标任务的领域相关性比数据规模更重要，适当整合手术特定数据能显著提升少样本SSA性能，但需注意数据源的相关性以避免性能下降

Abstract: Automated surgical skill assessment (SSA) is a central task in surgical
computer vision. Developing robust SSA models is challenging due to the
scarcity of skill annotations, which are time-consuming to produce and require
expert consensus. Few-shot learning (FSL) offers a scalable alternative
enabling model development with minimal supervision, though its success
critically depends on effective pre-training. While widely studied for several
surgical downstream tasks, pre-training has remained largely unexplored in SSA.
In this work, we formulate SSA as a few-shot task and investigate how
self-supervised pre-training strategies affect downstream few-shot SSA
performance. We annotate a publicly available robotic surgery dataset with
Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skill (OSATS) scores, and evaluate
various pre-training sources across three few-shot settings. We quantify domain
similarity and analyze how domain gap and the inclusion of procedure-specific
data into pre-training influence transferability. Our results show that small
but domain-relevant datasets can outperform large scale, less aligned ones,
achieving accuracies of 60.16%, 66.03%, and 73.65% in the 1-, 2-, and 5-shot
settings, respectively. Moreover, incorporating procedure-specific data into
pre-training with a domain-relevant external dataset significantly boosts
downstream performance, with an average gain of +1.22% in accuracy and +2.28%
in F1-score; however, applying the same strategy with less similar but
large-scale sources can instead lead to performance degradation. Code and
models are available at https://github.com/anastadimi/ssa-fsl.

Abstract: This paper aims to recover the intrinsic reflectance layer and shading layer
given a single image. Though this intrinsic image decomposition problem has
been studied for decades, it remains a significant challenge in cases of
complex scenes, i.e. spatially-varying lighting effect and rich textures. In
this paper, we propose a novel method for handling severe lighting and rich
textures in intrinsic image decomposition, which enables to produce
high-quality intrinsic images for real-world images. Specifically, we observe
that previous learning-based methods tend to produce texture-less and
over-smoothing intrinsic images, which can be used to infer the lighting and
texture information given a RGB image. In this way, we design a texture-guided
regularization term and formulate the decomposition problem into an
optimization framework, to separate the material textures and lighting effect.
We demonstrate that combining the novel texture-aware prior can produce
superior results to existing approaches.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了PnP方法与DDIM在解决不适定逆问题（特别是单像素成像）中的联系，提出了将扩散过程解耦为去噪、数据一致性执行和采样的统一框架，并设计了混合数据一致性模块来提升重建质量。

Motivation: 研究PnP方法与扩散模型之间的联系，特别是在解决单像素成像等不适定逆问题时，如何更好地整合学习先验与物理前向模型。

Method: 将扩散过程解耦为三个可解释阶段：去噪、数据一致性执行和采样；提出混合数据一致性模块，线性组合多个PnP式保真度项，直接应用于去噪估计。

Result: 在单像素成像任务上的实验结果表明，该方法获得了更好的重建质量。

Conclusion: 提出的统一框架能够以原则性方式整合学习先验与物理模型，混合数据一致性模块在不破坏扩散采样轨迹的情况下改善了测量一致性。

Abstract: We explore the connection between Plug-and-Play (PnP) methods and Denoising
Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) for solving ill-posed inverse problems, with a
focus on single-pixel imaging. We begin by identifying key distinctions between
PnP and diffusion models-particularly in their denoising mechanisms and
sampling procedures. By decoupling the diffusion process into three
interpretable stages: denoising, data consistency enforcement, and sampling, we
provide a unified framework that integrates learned priors with physical
forward models in a principled manner. Building upon this insight, we propose a
hybrid data-consistency module that linearly combines multiple PnP-style
fidelity terms. This hybrid correction is applied directly to the denoised
estimate, improving measurement consistency without disrupting the diffusion
sampling trajectory. Experimental results on single-pixel imaging tasks
demonstrate that our method achieves better reconstruction quality.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种全自动的两阶段框架，通过视神经夹直径测量和临床数据融合，实现了净确的静脉压分级预测，显著提升了传统手工测量方法的净确性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 静脉压升高对脑功能构成严重威胁，而目前的腰穿测量方法供容性强、风险大，手工ONSD测量存在不一致性、主观性和变异性问题，需要可靠的非侵入性替代方案。

Method: 设计了全自动两阶段框架：第一阶段进行眼底超声视频处理，包括框级解剖分割、基于规则的关键帧识别和精确ONSD测量；第二阶段融合ONSD指标和临床特征进行静脉压分级预测。

Result: 验证集净确度达到0.845±0.071（五折交叉验证），独立测试集净确度0.786，显著超越传统阈值方法（验证集0.637±0.111，测试集0.429）。

Conclusion: 该框架通过减少操作变异性和融合多源信息，建立了可靠的非侵入性静脉压评估方法，为急性神经系统疾病患者管理提供了新的希望。

Abstract: Intracranial pressure (ICP) elevation poses severe threats to cerebral
function, thus necessitating monitoring for timely intervention. While lumbar
puncture is the gold standard for ICP measurement, its invasiveness and
associated risks drive the need for non-invasive alternatives. Optic nerve
sheath diameter (ONSD) has emerged as a promising biomarker, as elevated ICP
directly correlates with increased ONSD. However, current clinical practices
for ONSD measurement suffer from inconsistency in manual operation,
subjectivity in optimal view selection, and variability in thresholding,
limiting their reliability. To address these challenges, we introduce a fully
automatic two-stage framework for ICP grading, integrating keyframe
identification, ONSD measurement and clinical data. Specifically, the fundus
ultrasound video processing stage performs frame-level anatomical segmentation,
rule-based keyframe identification guided by an international consensus
statement, and precise ONSD measurement. The intracranial pressure grading
stage then fuses ONSD metrics with clinical features to enable the prediction
of ICP grades, thereby demonstrating an innovative blend of interpretable
ultrasound analysis and multi-source data integration for objective clinical
evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves a
validation accuracy of $0.845 \pm 0.071$ (with standard deviation from
five-fold cross-validation) and an independent test accuracy of 0.786,
significantly outperforming conventional threshold-based method ($0.637 \pm
0.111$ validation accuracy, $0.429$ test accuracy). Through effectively
reducing operator variability and integrating multi-source information, our
framework establishes a reliable non-invasive approach for clinical ICP
evaluation, holding promise for improving patient management in acute
neurological conditions.

TL;DR: 无监督IC缺陷分割框架，通过从测试图像中提取正常特征并重建正常内容，利用重建殊差进行缺陷分割，免需外部正常数据支持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有IC缺陷分割方法需要外部正常数据库进行对比，但IC平面布局差异性大且准确对准困难，导致方法脆弱。研究发现缺陷通常是局部的，而每张图像中仍包含丰富的重复正常模式。

Method: 设计了可学习正常信息提取器，从测试图像中聚合代表性正常特征，通过一致性损失确保这些特征与正常区域关联。在这些特征指导下，解码器重建只包含正常内容的图像，利用重建殊差进行缺陷分割。还使用了假异常增广来稳定训练。

Result: 在三个IC制造流程步骤的数据集上进行实验，结果显示该方法比现有方法更一致地提升了性能，并展现出对产品变异性的强壁性。

Conclusion: 该无监督框架能够有效分割IC制造中的缺陷，免需外部正常数据支持，具有良好的自适应能力和强壁性，适用于不同产品和变化的平面布局。

Abstract: Modern Integrated-Circuit(IC) manufacturing introduces diverse, fine-grained
defects that depress yield and reliability. Most industrial defect segmentation
compares a test image against an external normal set, a strategy that is
brittle for IC imagery where layouts vary across products and accurate
alignment is difficult. We observe that defects are predominantly local, while
each image still contains rich, repeatable normal patterns. We therefore
propose an unsupervised IC defect segmentation framework that requires no
external normal support. A learnable normal-information extractor aggregates
representative normal features from the test image, and a coherence loss
enforces their association with normal regions. Guided by these features, a
decoder reconstructs only normal content; the reconstruction residual then
segments defects. Pseudo-anomaly augmentation further stabilizes training.
Experiments on datasets from three IC process stages show consistent
improvements over existing approaches and strong robustness to product
variability.

Motivation: 医学视觉语言模型在临床决策支持中具有潜力，但由于成像协议和自由文本报告的变异性，模型容易学习任务无关的相关性，导致在真实世界环境中泛化能力有限且存在安全风险。

Method: 提出结构化特征解耦框架DRiFt，使用参数高效调优（LoRA）和可学习提示令牌显式分离临床相关信号和任务无关噪声。通过为多样化医学数据集生成高质量、临床基础的图像-文本对来增强跨模态对齐。

Conclusion: 该方法有助于构建更安全、更可信的临床用视觉语言模型，通过解耦任务相关特征和精心对齐来减少领域偏移下的不可预测行为。

Abstract: Medical vision-language models (VLMs) offer promise for clinical decision
support, yet their reliability under distribution shifts remains a major
concern for safe deployment. These models often learn task-agnostic
correlations due to variability in imaging protocols and free-text reports,
limiting their generalizability and increasing the risk of failure in
real-world settings. We propose DRiFt, a structured feature decoupling
framework that explicitly separates clinically relevant signals from
task-agnostic noise using parameter-efficient tuning (LoRA) and learnable
prompt tokens. To enhance cross-modal alignment and reduce uncertainty, we
curate high-quality, clinically grounded image-text pairs by generating
captions for a diverse medical dataset. Our approach improves in-distribution
performance by +11.4% Top-1 accuracy and +3.3% Macro-F1 over prior prompt-based
methods, while maintaining strong robustness across unseen datasets. Ablation
studies reveal that disentangling task-relevant features and careful alignment
significantly enhance model generalization and reduce unpredictable behavior
under domain shift. These insights contribute toward building safer, more
trustworthy VLMs for clinical use. The code is available at

Motivation: 现有图像融合技术在低分辨率、弱语义信息的多模态图像中表现不佳，特别是在军事侦察和远程检测任务中，目标与背景结构容易损坏，需要同时解决融合和超分辨率问题

Conclusion: FS-Diff通过语义引导和清晰度感知机制，成功解决了低分辨率多模态图像融合的挑战，为实际应用提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: As an influential information fusion and low-level vision technique, image
fusion integrates complementary information from source images to yield an
informative fused image. A few attempts have been made in recent years to
jointly realize image fusion and super-resolution. However, in real-world
applications such as military reconnaissance and long-range detection missions,
the target and background structures in multimodal images are easily corrupted,
with low resolution and weak semantic information, which leads to suboptimal
results in current fusion techniques. In response, we propose FS-Diff, a
semantic guidance and clarity-aware joint image fusion and super-resolution
method. FS-Diff unifies image fusion and super-resolution as a conditional
generation problem. It leverages semantic guidance from the proposed clarity
sensing mechanism for adaptive low-resolution perception and cross-modal
feature extraction. Specifically, we initialize the desired fused result as
pure Gaussian noise and introduce the bidirectional feature Mamba to extract
the global features of the multimodal images. Moreover, utilizing the source
images and semantics as conditions, we implement a random iterative denoising
process via a modified U-Net network. This network istrained for denoising at
multiple noise levels to produce high-resolution fusion results with
cross-modal features and abundant semantic information. We also construct a
powerful aerial view multiscene (AVMS) benchmark covering 600 pairs of images.
Extensive joint image fusion and super-resolution experiments on six public and
our AVMS datasets demonstrated that FS-Diff outperforms the state-of-the-art
methods at multiple magnifications and can recover richer details and semantics
in the fused images. The code is available at

Conclusion: 通过显式语义集中方法，成功解决了密集自监督学习中的补丁过度分散问题，为密集表示学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in image-level self-supervised learning (SSL) have made
significant progress, yet learning dense representations for patches remains
challenging. Mainstream methods encounter an over-dispersion phenomenon that
patches from the same instance/category scatter, harming downstream performance
on dense tasks. This work reveals that image-level SSL avoids over-dispersion
by involving implicit semantic concentration. Specifically, the non-strict
spatial alignment ensures intra-instance consistency, while shared patterns,
i.e., similar parts of within-class instances in the input space, ensure
inter-image consistency. Unfortunately, these approaches are infeasible for
dense SSL due to their spatial sensitivity and complicated scene-centric data.
These observations motivate us to explore explicit semantic concentration for
dense SSL. First, to break the strict spatial alignment, we propose to distill
the patch correspondences. Facing noisy and imbalanced pseudo labels, we
propose a noise-tolerant ranking loss. The core idea is extending the Average
Precision (AP) loss to continuous targets, such that its decision-agnostic and
adaptive focusing properties prevent the student model from being misled.
Second, to discriminate the shared patterns from complicated scenes, we propose
the object-aware filter to map the output space to an object-based space.
Specifically, patches are represented by learnable prototypes of objects via
cross-attention. Last but not least, empirical studies across various tasks
soundly support the effectiveness of our method. Code is available in

TL;DR: FlexiD-Fuse是一个基于扩散模型的医学图像融合网络，能够处理任意数量的输入模态，解决了现有方法只能处理固定数量模态输入的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学图像融合方法只能处理固定数量的模态输入（如双模态或三模态），无法直接处理变化数量的输入，这限制了其在临床环境中的应用。不同模态的医学图像提供独特的生理和解剖信息，需要一种能够灵活处理任意数量模态输入的融合方法。

Method: 提出FlexiD-Fuse扩散网络，将扩散融合问题转化为基于扩散过程和分层贝叶斯建模的最大似然估计问题。通过将期望最大化算法整合到扩散采样迭代过程中，能够生成高质量的融合图像，不受输入图像数量的限制。

Conclusion: FlexiD-Fuse能够端到端处理任意数量的模态输入，在医学图像融合和其他多模态图像融合任务中表现出色，为临床诊断提供了更灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Different modalities of medical images provide unique physiological and
anatomical information for diseases. Multi-modal medical image fusion
integrates useful information from different complementary medical images with
different modalities, producing a fused image that comprehensively and
objectively reflects lesion characteristics to assist doctors in clinical
diagnosis. However, existing fusion methods can only handle a fixed number of
modality inputs, such as accepting only two-modal or tri-modal inputs, and
cannot directly process varying input quantities, which hinders their
application in clinical settings. To tackle this issue, we introduce
FlexiD-Fuse, a diffusion-based image fusion network designed to accommodate
flexible quantities of input modalities. It can end-to-end process two-modal
and tri-modal medical image fusion under the same weight. FlexiD-Fuse
transforms the diffusion fusion problem, which supports only fixed-condition
inputs, into a maximum likelihood estimation problem based on the diffusion
process and hierarchical Bayesian modeling. By incorporating the
Expectation-Maximization algorithm into the diffusion sampling iteration
process, FlexiD-Fuse can generate high-quality fused images with cross-modal
information from source images, independently of the number of input images. We
compared the latest two and tri-modal medical image fusion methods, tested them
on Harvard datasets, and evaluated them using nine popular metrics. The
experimental results show that our method achieves the best performance in
medical image fusion with varying inputs. Meanwhile, we conducted extensive
extension experiments on infrared-visible, multi-exposure, and multi-focus
image fusion tasks with arbitrary numbers, and compared them with the
perspective SOTA methods. The results of the extension experiments consistently
demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method.

Conclusion: 该模型在数据质量和数量有限的条件下仍能实现良好的分割效果，具有良好的可部署性，为低资源地区提供了可访的医疗影像解决方案，有助于缩小全球健康AI技术的差距

Abstract: Gliomas are the most prevalent type of primary brain tumors, and their
accurate segmentation from MRI is critical for diagnosis, treatment planning,
and longitudinal monitoring. However, the scarcity of high-quality annotated
imaging data in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) poses a significant challenge for
deploying advanced segmentation models in clinical workflows. This study
introduces a robust and computationally efficient deep learning framework
tailored for resource-constrained settings. We leveraged a 3D Attention UNet
architecture augmented with residual blocks and enhanced through transfer
learning from pre-trained weights on the BraTS 2021 dataset. Our model was
evaluated on 95 MRI cases from the BraTS-Africa dataset, a benchmark for glioma
segmentation in SSA MRI data. Despite the limited data quality and quantity,
our approach achieved Dice scores of 0.76 for the Enhancing Tumor (ET), 0.80
for Necrotic and Non-Enhancing Tumor Core (NETC), and 0.85 for Surrounding
Non-Functional Hemisphere (SNFH). These results demonstrate the
generalizability of the proposed model and its potential to support clinical
decision making in low-resource settings. The compact architecture,
approximately 90 MB, and sub-minute per-volume inference time on consumer-grade
hardware further underscore its practicality for deployment in SSA health
systems. This work contributes toward closing the gap in equitable AI for
global health by empowering underserved regions with high-performing and
accessible medical imaging solutions.

Abstract: Deepfakes, synthetic media created using advanced AI techniques, have
intensified the spread of misinformation, particularly in politically sensitive
contexts. Existing deepfake detection datasets are often limited, relying on
outdated generation methods, low realism, or single-face imagery, restricting
the effectiveness for general synthetic image detection. By analyzing social
media posts, we identify multiple modalities through which deepfakes propagate
misinformation. Furthermore, our human perception study demonstrates that
recently developed proprietary models produce synthetic images increasingly
indistinguishable from real ones, complicating accurate identification by the
general public. Consequently, we present a comprehensive, politically-focused
dataset specifically crafted for benchmarking detection against modern
generative models. This dataset contains three million real images paired with
descriptive captions, which are used for generating 963k corresponding
high-quality synthetic images from a mix of proprietary and open-source models.
Recognizing the continual evolution of generative techniques, we introduce an
innovative crowdsourced adversarial platform, where participants are
incentivized to generate and submit challenging synthetic images. This ongoing
community-driven initiative ensures that deepfake detection methods remain
robust and adaptive, proactively safeguarding public discourse from
sophisticated misinformation threats.

Conclusion: 动量约束提供了一种物理基础的方法来关联局部关节行为与全局位移，有效解决了局部与全局运动耦合的挑战

Abstract: Many studies decompose human motion into local motion in a frame attached to
the root joint and global motion of the root joint in the world frame, treating
them separately. However, these two components are not independent. Global
movement arises from interactions with the environment, which are, in turn,
driven by changes in the body configuration. Motion models often fail to
precisely capture this physical coupling between local and global dynamics,
while deriving global trajectories from joint torques and external forces is
computationally expensive and complex. To address these challenges, we propose
using whole-body linear and angular momentum as a constraint to link local
motion with global movement. Since momentum reflects the aggregate effect of
joint-level dynamics on the body's movement through space, it provides a
physically grounded way to relate local joint behavior to global displacement.
Building on this insight, we introduce a new loss term that enforces
consistency between the generated momentum profiles and those observed in
ground-truth data. Incorporating our loss reduces foot sliding and jitter,
improves balance, and preserves the accuracy of the recovered motion. Code and
data are available at the project page https://hlinhn.github.io/momentum_bmvc.

Abstract: Understanding region-wise correspondence between manga line art images is a
fundamental task in manga processing, enabling downstream applications such as
automatic line art colorization and in-between frame generation. However, this
task remains largely unexplored, especially in realistic scenarios without
pre-existing segmentation or annotations. In this paper, we introduce a novel
and practical task: predicting region-wise correspondence between raw manga
line art images without any pre-existing labels or masks. To tackle this
problem, we divide each line art image into a set of patches and propose a
Transformer-based framework that learns patch-level similarities within and
across images. We then apply edge-aware clustering and a region matching
algorithm to convert patch-level predictions into coherent region-level
correspondences. To support training and evaluation, we develop an automatic
annotation pipeline and manually refine a subset of the data to construct
benchmark datasets. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that our
method achieves high patch-level accuracy (e.g., 96.34%) and generates
consistent region-level correspondences, highlighting its potential for
real-world manga applications.

Abstract: In recent years, Multi-View Clustering (MVC) has been significantly advanced
under the influence of deep learning. By integrating heterogeneous data from
multiple views, MVC enhances clustering analysis, making multi-view fusion
critical to clustering performance. However, there is a problem of low-quality
data in multi-view fusion. This problem primarily arises from two reasons: 1)
Certain views are contaminated by noisy data. 2) Some views suffer from missing
data. This paper proposes a novel Stochastic Generative Diffusion Fusion (SGDF)
method to address this problem. SGDF leverages a multiple generative mechanism
for the multi-view feature of each sample. It is robust to low-quality data.
Building on SGDF, we further present the Generative Diffusion Contrastive
Network (GDCN). Extensive experiments show that GDCN achieves the
state-of-the-art results in deep MVC tasks. The source code is publicly

Abstract: Three-dimensional ultrasound (US) offers many clinical advantages over
conventional 2D imaging, yet its widespread adoption is limited by the cost and
complexity of traditional 3D systems. Sensorless 3D US, which uses deep
learning to estimate a 3D probe trajectory from a sequence of 2D US images, is
a promising alternative. Local features, such as speckle patterns, can help
predict frame-to-frame motion, while global features, such as coarse shapes and
anatomical structures, can situate the scan relative to anatomy and help
predict its general shape. In prior approaches, global features are either
ignored or tightly coupled with local feature extraction, restricting the
ability to robustly model these two complementary aspects. We propose
DualTrack, a novel dual-encoder architecture that leverages decoupled local and
global encoders specialized for their respective scales of feature extraction.
The local encoder uses dense spatiotemporal convolutions to capture
fine-grained features, while the global encoder utilizes an image backbone
(e.g., a 2D CNN or foundation model) and temporal attention layers to embed
high-level anatomical features and long-range dependencies. A lightweight

Motivation: 当前视频扩散模型主要关注架构创新和训练目标改进，但对特征表示能力的提升关注不足。研究发现将视频生成器的中间特征与预训练视觉编码器的特征表示对齐可以改善训练效果

Method: 提出Align4Gen方法，包括：1）新指标评估视觉编码器的判别性和时间一致性；2）多特征融合和对齐方法集成到视频扩散模型训练中

Result: 在无条件视频生成和类条件视频生成任务上评估，多种指标显示视频生成质量得到提升

Conclusion: 特征对齐是提升视频扩散模型性能的有效方法，Align4Gen通过多特征融合和对齐机制显著改善了视频生成效果

Abstract: Video diffusion models have advanced rapidly in the recent years as a result
of series of architectural innovations (e.g., diffusion transformers) and use
of novel training objectives (e.g., flow matching). In contrast, less attention
has been paid to improving the feature representation power of such models. In
this work, we show that training video diffusion models can benefit from
aligning the intermediate features of the video generator with feature
representations of pre-trained vision encoders. We propose a new metric and
conduct an in-depth analysis of various vision encoders to evaluate their
discriminability and temporal consistency, thereby assessing their suitability
for video feature alignment. Based on the analysis, we present Align4Gen which
provides a novel multi-feature fusion and alignment method integrated into
video diffusion model training. We evaluate Align4Gen both for unconditional
and class-conditional video generation tasks and show that it results in
improved video generation as quantified by various metrics. Full video results

Motivation: 现有的大规模人体运动捕捉数据集在人-物交互建模方面存在局限性，包括数据质量不高、接触穿透、漂浮和手部运动不正确等伪影问题，需要更好的基准数据集来推动3D人-物交互生成研究。

Method: 1) 整合和标准化21.81小时的HOI数据并添加详细文本标注；2) 提出统一的优化框架，基于接触不变性原理减少伪影并修正手部运动，将数据集扩展到30.70小时；3) 定义六个基准任务并开发统一的HOI生成建模方法。

Conclusion: InterAct数据集为解决3D人-物交互生成中的数据集限制问题提供了重要资源，将积极维护并公开可用，以支持该领域的持续研究。

Abstract: While large-scale human motion capture datasets have advanced human motion
generation, modeling and generating dynamic 3D human-object interactions (HOIs)
remain challenging due to dataset limitations. Existing datasets often lack
extensive, high-quality motion and annotation and exhibit artifacts such as
contact penetration, floating, and incorrect hand motions. To address these
issues, we introduce InterAct, a large-scale 3D HOI benchmark featuring dataset
and methodological advancements. First, we consolidate and standardize 21.81
hours of HOI data from diverse sources, enriching it with detailed textual
annotations. Second, we propose a unified optimization framework to enhance
data quality by reducing artifacts and correcting hand motions. Leveraging the
principle of contact invariance, we maintain human-object relationships while
introducing motion variations, expanding the dataset to 30.70 hours. Third, we
define six benchmarking tasks and develop a unified HOI generative modeling
perspective, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Extensive experiments
validate the utility of our dataset as a foundational resource for advancing 3D
human-object interaction generation. To support continued research in this
area, the dataset is publicly available at
https://github.com/wzyabcas/InterAct, and will be actively maintained.

<details>

Motivation: 深度学习算法在MRI脑部成像诊断中可能因捷径学习而使用与输出标签无关的虚假特征，当这些特征与受保护属性相关时，会导致对少数群体的性能偏差

Method: 首先研究DL算法能否从3D脑MRI扫描中识别种族或性别以确认分布偏移；然后检查训练集种族或性别不平衡是否导致性能下降；最后对受保护属性和AD分类任务进行定量和定性特征归因分析

Result: 使用多个数据集和DL模型（ResNet和SwinTransformer）证明了基于种族和性别的捷径学习和偏见在DL-based AD分类中的存在

Conclusion: 这项工作为开发更公平的脑MRI深度学习诊断工具奠定了基础

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the gold standard for brain imaging. Deep
learning (DL) algorithms have been proposed to aid in the diagnosis of diseases
such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) from MRI scans. However, DL algorithms can
suffer from shortcut learning, in which spurious features, not directly related
to the output label, are used for prediction. When these features are related
to protected attributes, they can lead to performance bias against
underrepresented protected groups, such as those defined by race and sex. In
this work, we explore the potential for shortcut learning and demographic bias
in DL based AD diagnosis from MRI. We first investigate if DL algorithms can
identify race or sex from 3D brain MRI scans to establish the presence or
otherwise of race and sex based distributional shifts. Next, we investigate
whether training set imbalance by race or sex can cause a drop in model
performance, indicating shortcut learning and bias. Finally, we conduct a
quantitative and qualitative analysis of feature attributions in different
brain regions for both the protected attribute and AD classification tasks.
Through these experiments, and using multiple datasets and DL models (ResNet
and SwinTransformer), we demonstrate the existence of both race and sex based
shortcut learning and bias in DL based AD classification. Our work lays the
foundation for fairer DL diagnostic tools in brain MRI. The code is provided at

Method: 使用权重共享的Siamese编码器，集成LoRA和Adapter模块，采用SAM2和DINOv3作为骨干网络，配合轻量级解码器

Result: 在SYSU-CD(IoU 73.81%)、WHUCD(92.05%)、MSRSCD(64.07%)、MLCD(76.89%)、CDD(97.01%)、S2Looking(52.25%)和LEVIR-CD(85.62%)等多个数据集上达到最先进性能

Conclusion: PeftCD在准确性、效率和泛化性之间实现了最佳平衡，为大规模VFMs适应实际遥感变化检测应用提供了强大且可扩展的范式

Abstract: To tackle the prevalence of pseudo changes, the scarcity of labeled samples,
and the difficulty of cross-domain generalization in multi-temporal and
multi-source remote sensing imagery, we propose PeftCD, a change detection
framework built upon Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) with Parameter-Efficient
Fine-Tuning (PEFT). At its core, PeftCD employs a weight-sharing Siamese
encoder derived from a VFM, into which LoRA and Adapter modules are seamlessly
integrated. This design enables highly efficient task adaptation by training
only a minimal set of additional parameters. To fully unlock the potential of
VFMs, we investigate two leading backbones: the Segment Anything Model v2
(SAM2), renowned for its strong segmentation priors, and DINOv3, a
state-of-the-art self-supervised representation learner. The framework is
complemented by a deliberately lightweight decoder, ensuring the focus remains
on the powerful feature representations from the backbones. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that PeftCD achieves state-of-the-art performance
across multiple public datasets, including SYSU-CD (IoU 73.81%), WHUCD
(92.05%), MSRSCD (64.07%), MLCD (76.89%), CDD (97.01%), S2Looking (52.25%) and
LEVIR-CD (85.62%), with notably precise boundary delineation and strong
suppression of pseudo-changes. In summary, PeftCD presents an optimal balance
of accuracy, efficiency, and generalization. It offers a powerful and scalable
paradigm for adapting large-scale VFMs to real-world remote sensing change
detection applications. The code and pretrained models will be released at

TL;DR: Kling-Avatar是一个新颖的级联框架，通过多模态指令理解和照片级真实感人像生成，解决了现有音频驱动虚拟人视频生成方法在叙事连贯性和角色表现力方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅将指令条件视为声学或视觉线索驱动的低级跟踪，没有建模指令传达的交流目的，这限制了叙事连贯性和角色表现力。

Method: 采用两阶段流水线：第一阶段使用多模态大语言模型导演生成蓝图视频控制高级语义；第二阶段基于蓝图关键帧并行生成多个子片段，采用首尾帧策略保持细节并编码高级意图。

Result: 能够生成生动、流畅、长时长的1080p 48fps视频，在唇形同步准确性、情感和动态表现力、指令可控性、身份保持和跨域泛化方面表现优异。

Conclusion: Kling-Avatar为语义基础的高保真音频驱动虚拟人合成建立了新的基准，适用于数字人直播和视频博客等实际应用。

Abstract: Recent advances in audio-driven avatar video generation have significantly
enhanced audio-visual realism. However, existing methods treat instruction
conditioning merely as low-level tracking driven by acoustic or visual cues,
without modeling the communicative purpose conveyed by the instructions. This
limitation compromises their narrative coherence and character expressiveness.
To bridge this gap, we introduce Kling-Avatar, a novel cascaded framework that
unifies multimodal instruction understanding with photorealistic portrait
generation. Our approach adopts a two-stage pipeline. In the first stage, we
design a multimodal large language model (MLLM) director that produces a
blueprint video conditioned on diverse instruction signals, thereby governing
high-level semantics such as character motion and emotions. In the second
stage, guided by blueprint keyframes, we generate multiple sub-clips in
parallel using a first-last frame strategy. This global-to-local framework
preserves fine-grained details while faithfully encoding the high-level intent
behind multimodal instructions. Our parallel architecture also enables fast and
stable generation of long-duration videos, making it suitable for real-world
applications such as digital human livestreaming and vlogging. To
comprehensively evaluate our method, we construct a benchmark of 375 curated
samples covering diverse instructions and challenging scenarios. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that Kling-Avatar is capable of generating vivid,
fluent, long-duration videos at up to 1080p and 48 fps, achieving superior
performance in lip synchronization accuracy, emotion and dynamic
expressiveness, instruction controllability, identity preservation, and
cross-domain generalization. These results establish Kling-Avatar as a new
benchmark for semantically grounded, high-fidelity audio-driven avatar
synthesis.

Motivation: 预测脑肿瘤的时空进展对于指导神经肿瘤学临床决策至关重要，特别是在数据有限的情况下需要生物学信息支持的图像生成方法。

Method: 使用常微分方程系统构建机制模型捕捉肿瘤动态（包括放疗效应），结合梯度引导的DDIM模型进行图像合成，确保与预测生长和患者解剖结构对齐。

Result: 在BraTS成人和儿童胶质瘤数据集上训练，在60个纵向儿童DMG病例上评估，生成逼真的随访扫描，并通过空间相似性指标和95% Hausdorff距离验证肿瘤生长概率图。

Conclusion: 该方法在数据有限场景下实现生物学信息图像生成，提供考虑机制先验的生成式时空预测，能够捕捉临床相关的肿瘤生长范围和方向性。

Abstract: Predicting the spatio-temporal progression of brain tumors is essential for
guiding clinical decisions in neuro-oncology. We propose a hybrid mechanistic
learning framework that combines a mathematical tumor growth model with a
guided denoising diffusion implicit model (DDIM) to synthesize anatomically
feasible future MRIs from preceding scans. The mechanistic model, formulated as
a system of ordinary differential equations, captures temporal tumor dynamics
including radiotherapy effects and estimates future tumor burden. These
estimates condition a gradient-guided DDIM, enabling image synthesis that
aligns with both predicted growth and patient anatomy. We train our model on
the BraTS adult and pediatric glioma datasets and evaluate on 60 axial slices
of in-house longitudinal pediatric diffuse midline glioma (DMG) cases. Our
framework generates realistic follow-up scans based on spatial similarity
metrics. It also introduces tumor growth probability maps, which capture both
clinically relevant extent and directionality of tumor growth as shown by 95th
percentile Hausdorff Distance. The method enables biologically informed image
generation in data-limited scenarios, offering generative-space-time
predictions that account for mechanistic priors.

Conclusion: HumbleBench通过引入显式的错误选项拒绝机制，为安全关键环境中的MLLM可靠性提供了更现实的衡量标准。

Abstract: Hallucinations in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) -- where the model
generates content inconsistent with the input image -- pose significant risks
in real-world applications, from misinformation in visual question answering to
unsafe errors in decision-making. Existing benchmarks primarily test
recognition accuracy, i.e., evaluating whether models can select the correct
answer among distractors. This overlooks an equally critical capability for
trustworthy AI: recognizing when none of the provided options are correct, a
behavior reflecting epistemic humility. We present HumbleBench, a new
hallucination benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' ability to reject plausible
but incorrect answers across three hallucination types: object, relation, and
attribute. Built from a panoptic scene graph dataset, we leverage fine-grained
scene graph annotations to extract ground-truth entities and relations, and
prompt GPT-4-Turbo to generate multiple-choice questions, followed by a
rigorous manual filtering process. Each question includes a "None of the above"
option, requiring models not only to recognize correct visual information but
also to identify when no provided answer is valid. We evaluate a variety of
state-of-the-art MLLMs -- including both general-purpose and specialized
reasoning models -- on HumbleBench and share valuable findings and insights
with the community. By incorporating explicit false-option rejection,
HumbleBench fills a key gap in current evaluation suites, providing a more
realistic measure of MLLM reliability in safety-critical settings. Our code and
dataset are released publicly and can be accessed at

Motivation: 通过编码器(图像到文本)和解码器(文本到图像)的自动编码器框架，实现理解与生成过程的双向信息流动，获得相互增益

Method: 首先用大规模长上下文图像描述预训练解码器，然后通过统一强化学习(Unified-GRPO)进行三阶段训练：冷启动、生成促理解、理解促生成

Result: 编码器自主产生更描述性的描述，解码器能理解复杂描述并生成高保真度的重建图像，形成了突出的双向协同效果

Conclusion: UAE框架通过统一的重建训练目标和强化学习机制，实现了多模态理解与生成的深度融合，为统一多模态学习领域提供了新的见解和方法

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce an insightful paradigm through the Auto-Encoder
lens-understanding as the encoder (I2T) that compresses images into text, and
generation as the decoder (T2I) that reconstructs images from that text. Using
reconstruction fidelity as the unified training objective, we enforce the
coherent bidirectional information flow between the understanding and
generation processes, bringing mutual gains. To implement this, we propose UAE,
a novel framework for unified multimodal learning. We begin by pre-training the
decoder with large-scale long-context image captions to capture fine-grained
semantic and complex spatial relationships. We then propose Unified-GRPO via
reinforcement learning (RL), which covers three stages: (1) A cold-start phase
to gently initialize both encoder and decoder with a semantic reconstruction
loss; (2) Generation for Understanding, where the encoder is trained to
generate informative captions that maximize the decoder's reconstruction
quality, enhancing its visual understanding; (3) Understanding for Generation,
where the decoder is refined to reconstruct from these captions, forcing it to
leverage every detail and improving its long-context instruction following and
generation fidelity. For evaluation, we introduce Unified-Bench, the first
benchmark tailored to assess the degree of unification of the UMMs. A
surprising "aha moment" arises within the multimodal learning domain: as RL
progresses, the encoder autonomously produces more descriptive captions, while
the decoder simultaneously demonstrates a profound ability to understand these
intricate descriptions, resulting in reconstructions of striking fidelity.

Conclusion: NRMF通过几何感知的运动建模方法，为3D人体运动恢复提供了更鲁棒和物理合理的解决方案，具有良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: We introduce Neural Riemannian Motion Fields (NRMF), a novel 3D generative
human motion prior that enables robust, temporally consistent, and physically
plausible 3D motion recovery. Unlike existing VAE or diffusion-based methods,
our higher-order motion prior explicitly models the human motion in the zero
level set of a collection of neural distance fields (NDFs) corresponding to
pose, transition (velocity), and acceleration dynamics. Our framework is
rigorous in the sense that our NDFs are constructed on the product space of
joint rotations, their angular velocities, and angular accelerations,
respecting the geometry of the underlying articulations. We further introduce:
(i) a novel adaptive-step hybrid algorithm for projecting onto the set of
plausible motions, and (ii) a novel geometric integrator to "roll out"
realistic motion trajectories during test-time-optimization and generation. Our
experiments show significant and consistent gains: trained on the AMASS
dataset, NRMF remarkably generalizes across multiple input modalities and to
diverse tasks ranging from denoising to motion in-betweening and fitting to
partial 2D / 3D observations.

Method: 通过理论分析和实验验证，使用最优参数线性去噪器展示其与深度神经去噪器相似的局部性特征，并证明这种局部性源于自然图像中的像素相关性

Result: 发现最优参数线性去噪器表现出与深度神经去噪器相似的局部性，证实局部性源于图像数据集统计特性而非网络架构偏置，构建了比现有方法更匹配深度扩散模型的解析去噪器

Conclusion: 扩散模型中的局部性主要来源于图像数据集的统计特性，而不是卷积神经网络的归纳偏置，这一发现有助于构建更准确的解析模型来理解扩散模型行为

Abstract: Among generative models, diffusion models are uniquely intriguing due to the
existence of a closed-form optimal minimizer of their training objective, often
referred to as the optimal denoiser. However, diffusion using this optimal
denoiser merely reproduces images in the training set and hence fails to
capture the behavior of deep diffusion models. Recent work has attempted to
characterize this gap between the optimal denoiser and deep diffusion models,
proposing analytical, training-free models that can generate images that
resemble those generated by a trained UNet. The best-performing method
hypothesizes that shift equivariance and locality inductive biases of
convolutional neural networks are the cause of the performance gap, hence
incorporating these assumptions into its analytical model. In this work, we
present evidence that the locality in deep diffusion models emerges as a
statistical property of the image dataset, not due to the inductive bias of
convolutional neural networks. Specifically, we demonstrate that an optimal
parametric linear denoiser exhibits similar locality properties to the deep
neural denoisers. We further show, both theoretically and experimentally, that
this locality arises directly from the pixel correlations present in natural
image datasets. Finally, we use these insights to craft an analytical denoiser
that better matches scores predicted by a deep diffusion model than the prior
expert-crafted alternative.

Abstract: Significant progress has been made in spatial intelligence, spanning both
spatial reconstruction and world exploration. However, the scalability and
real-world fidelity of current models remain severely constrained by the
scarcity of large-scale, high-quality training data. While several datasets
provide camera pose information, they are typically limited in scale,
diversity, and annotation richness, particularly for real-world dynamic scenes
with ground-truth camera motion. To this end, we collect \textbf{SpatialVID}, a
dataset consists of a large corpus of in-the-wild videos with diverse scenes,
camera movements and dense 3D annotations such as per-frame camera poses,
depth, and motion instructions. Specifically, we collect more than 21,000 hours

Abstract: The advancement of open-source text-to-image (T2I) models has been hindered
by the absence of large-scale, reasoning-focused datasets and comprehensive
evaluation benchmarks, resulting in a performance gap compared to leading
closed-source systems. To address this challenge, We introduce FLUX-Reason-6M
and PRISM-Bench (Precise and Robust Image Synthesis Measurement Benchmark).
FLUX-Reason-6M is a massive dataset consisting of 6 million high-quality
FLUX-generated images and 20 million bilingual (English and Chinese)
descriptions specifically designed to teach complex reasoning. The image are
organized according to six key characteristics: Imagination, Entity, Text
rendering, Style, Affection, and Composition, and design explicit Generation
Chain-of-Thought (GCoT) to provide detailed breakdowns of image generation
steps. The whole data curation takes 15,000 A100 GPU days, providing the
community with a resource previously unattainable outside of large industrial
labs. PRISM-Bench offers a novel evaluation standard with seven distinct
tracks, including a formidable Long Text challenge using GCoT. Through
carefully designed prompts, it utilizes advanced vision-language models for
nuanced human-aligned assessment of prompt-image alignment and image
aesthetics. Our extensive evaluation of 19 leading models on PRISM-Bench
reveals critical performance gaps and highlights specific areas requiring
improvement. Our dataset, benchmark, and evaluation code are released to
catalyze the next wave of reasoning-oriented T2I generation. Project page:

Abstract: Coordinating a fully distributed multi-agent system (MAS) can be challenging
when the communication channel has very limited capabilities in terms of
sending rate and packet payload. When the MAS has to deal with active obstacles
in a highly partially observable environment, the communication channel
acquires considerable relevance. In this paper, we present an approach to deal
with task assignments in extremely active scenarios, where tasks need to be
frequently reallocated among the agents participating in the coordination
process. Inspired by market-based task assignments, we introduce a novel
distributed coordination method to orchestrate autonomous agents' actions
efficiently in low communication scenarios. In particular, our algorithm takes
into account asymmetric obstacles. While in the real world, the majority of
obstacles are asymmetric, they are usually treated as symmetric ones, thus
limiting the applicability of existing methods. To summarize, the presented
architecture is designed to tackle scenarios where the obstacles are active and
asymmetric, the communication channel is poor and the environment is partially
observable. Our approach has been validated in simulation and in the real
world, using a team of NAO robots during official RoboCup competitions.
Experimental results show a notable reduction in task overlaps in limited
communication settings, with a decrease of 52% in the most frequent reallocated
task.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于3D纤维缠绕技术(3DFiT)制造轻量化面心立方晶格结构无人机框架的方法，使用连续单丝纤维确保精确纤维排列，消除了传统复合材料组装的弱点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 航空航天和机器人领域对轻量化高强度复合材料结构的需求日益增长，但传统复合材料制造方法难以实现复杂3D架构，且组装会引入连接弱点，连续纤维增强也面临挑战。

Method: 采用3D纤维缠绕技术(3DFiT)制造面心立方晶格结构无人机框架，使用连续单丝纤维确保精确纤维排列，避免了传统组装方法的弱点。

Result: 制造的无人机框架比强度达到金属和热塑性塑料的4-8倍，重量仅260克，比商用DJI F450框架轻10%，飞行时间延长3分钟，飞行测试证实了其稳定性和耐久性。

Conclusion: 单丝晶格桁架无人机框架具有巨大潜力，3DFiT技术可作为可扩展且高效的制造方法，为轻量化复合材料结构制造提供了新途径。

Abstract: The demand for lightweight and high-strength composite structures is rapidly
growing in aerospace and robotics, particularly for optimized drone frames.
However, conventional composite manufacturing methods struggle to achieve
complex 3D architectures for weight savings and rely on assembling separate
components, which introduce weak points at the joints. Additionally,
maintaining continuous fiber reinforcement remains challenging, limiting
structural efficiency. In this study, we demonstrate the lightweight Face
Centered Cubic (FFC) lattice structured conceptualization of drone frames for
weight reduction and complex topology fabrication through 3D Fiber Tethering
(3DFiT) using continuous single tow fiber ensuring precise fiber alignment,
eliminating weak points associated with traditional composite assembly.
Mechanical testing demonstrates that the fabricated drone frame exhibits a high
specific strength of around four to eight times the metal and thermoplastic,
outperforming other conventional 3D printing methods. The drone frame weighs
only 260 g, making it 10% lighter than the commercial DJI F450 frame, enhancing
structural integrity and contributing to an extended flight time of three
minutes, while flight testing confirms its stability and durability under
operational conditions. The findings demonstrate the potential of single tow
lattice truss-based drone frames, with 3DFiT serving as a scalable and
efficient manufacturing method.

*Alice Kate Li,Thales C Silva,Victoria Edwards,Vijay Kumar,M. Ani Hsieh*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: KoopMotion是一种基于流场的运动规划方法，使用Koopman算子理论来学习期望轨迹的动态系统表示，确保机器人从任意初始状态收敛到参考轨迹的终点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然Koopman算子理论在动态系统建模中表现有效，但它本身不保证收敛到期望轨迹或指定目标，这在从演示学习(LfD)中是必需的要求。

Method: 将运动流场表示为动态系统，用Koopman算子参数化来模仿期望轨迹，利用学习到的流场的发散特性获得平滑运动场，使机器人偏离期望轨迹时能收敛到参考轨迹并跟踪至终点。

Result: 在LASA手写数据集和3D机械臂末端轨迹数据集上评估显示高效性，物理机器人实验验证了在非静态流体环境中的有效性。方法具有高度样本效率，仅需3%的LASA数据生成密集运动规划，在时空动态建模指标上显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: KoopMotion提供了一种样本高效的流场运动规划方法，能够确保机器人收敛到期望轨迹并实现精确跟踪，在复杂环境中表现出色。

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel flow field-based motion planning method that
drives a robot from any initial state to a desired reference trajectory such
that it converges to the trajectory's end point. Despite demonstrated efficacy
in using Koopman operator theory for modeling dynamical systems, Koopman does
not inherently enforce convergence to desired trajectories nor to specified
goals -- a requirement when learning from demonstrations (LfD). We present
KoopMotion which represents motion flow fields as dynamical systems,
parameterized by Koopman Operators to mimic desired trajectories, and leverages
the divergence properties of the learnt flow fields to obtain smooth motion
fields that converge to a desired reference trajectory when a robot is placed
away from the desired trajectory, and tracks the trajectory until the end
point. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we show evaluations of
KoopMotion on the LASA human handwriting dataset and a 3D manipulator
end-effector trajectory dataset, including spectral analysis. We also perform
experiments on a physical robot, verifying KoopMotion on a miniature autonomous
surface vehicle operating in a non-static fluid flow environment. Our approach
is highly sample efficient in both space and time, requiring only 3\% of the
LASA dataset to generate dense motion plans. Additionally, KoopMotion provides
a significant improvement over baselines when comparing metrics that measure
spatial and temporal dynamics modeling efficacy.

Conclusion: 欠驱动变形机构在需要高效自适应加载解决方案的应用中具有实际潜力，所提出的建模优化框架可扩展到更广泛的机械臂类别。

Abstract: Fixed degree-of-freedom (DoF) loading mechanisms often suffer from excessive
actuators, complex control, and limited adaptability to dynamic tasks. This
study proposes an innovative mechanism of underactuated metamorphic loading
manipulators (UMLM), integrating a metamorphic arm with a passively adaptive
gripper. The metamorphic arm exploits geometric constraints, enabling the
topology reconfiguration and flexible motion trajectories without additional
actuators. The adaptive gripper, driven entirely by the arm, conforms to
diverse objects through passive compliance. A structural model is developed,
and a kinetostatics analysis is conducted to investigate isomorphic grasping
configurations. To optimize performance, Particle-Swarm Optimization (PSO) is
utilized to refine the gripper's dimensional parameters, ensuring robust
adaptability across various applications. Simulation results validate the
UMLM's easily implemented control strategy, operational versatility, and
effectiveness in grasping diverse objects in dynamic environments. This work
underscores the practical potential of underactuated metamorphic mechanisms in
applications requiring efficient and adaptable loading solutions. Beyond the
specific design, this generalized modeling and optimization framework extends
to a broader class of manipulators, offering a scalable approach to the
development of robotic systems that require efficiency, flexibility, and robust
performance.

Conclusion: 基于LIPM的奖励设计和双评论家架构有效提升了双足机器人在复杂户外环境中的感知运动稳定性和鲁棒性

Abstract: Achieving stable and robust perceptive locomotion for bipedal robots in
unstructured outdoor environments remains a critical challenge due to complex
terrain geometry and susceptibility to external disturbances. In this work, we
propose a novel reward design inspired by the Linear Inverted Pendulum Model
(LIPM) to enable perceptive and stable locomotion in the wild. The LIPM
provides theoretical guidance for dynamic balance by regulating the center of
mass (CoM) height and the torso orientation. These are key factors for
terrain-aware locomotion, as they help ensure a stable viewpoint for the
robot's camera. Building on this insight, we design a reward function that
promotes balance and dynamic stability while encouraging accurate CoM
trajectory tracking. To adaptively trade off between velocity tracking and
stability, we leverage the Reward Fusion Module (RFM) approach that prioritizes
stability when needed. A double-critic architecture is adopted to separately
evaluate stability and locomotion objectives, improving training efficiency and
robustness. We validate our approach through extensive experiments on a bipedal
robot in both simulation and real-world outdoor environments. The results
demonstrate superior terrain adaptability, disturbance rejection, and
consistent performance across a wide range of speeds and perceptual conditions.

Abstract: LiDAR-based 3D perception and localization on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)
are fundamentally limited by the narrow field of view (FoV) of compact LiDAR
sensors and the payload constraints that preclude multi-sensor configurations.
Traditional motorized scanning systems with fixed-speed rotations lack scene
awareness and task-level adaptability, leading to degraded odometry and mapping
performance in complex, occluded environments. Inspired by the active sensing
behavior of owls, we propose AEOS (Active Environment-aware Optimal Scanning),
a biologically inspired and computationally efficient framework for adaptive
LiDAR control in UAV-based LiDAR-Inertial Odometry (LIO). AEOS combines model
predictive control (MPC) and reinforcement learning (RL) in a hybrid
architecture: an analytical uncertainty model predicts future pose
observability for exploitation, while a lightweight neural network learns an
implicit cost map from panoramic depth representations to guide exploration. To
support scalable training and generalization, we develop a point cloud-based
simulation environment with real-world LiDAR maps across diverse scenes,
enabling sim-to-real transfer. Extensive experiments in both simulation and
real-world environments demonstrate that AEOS significantly improves odometry
accuracy compared to fixed-rate, optimization-only, and fully learned
baselines, while maintaining real-time performance under onboard computational
constraints. The project page can be found at

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种更加现实和有效的自主代客停车解决方案，通过结合预测能力和信息收益理念，能够在动态不确定环境中实现更高效、更安全的停车规划

Abstract: Accurately reasoning about future parking spot availability and integrated
planning is critical for enabling safe and efficient autonomous valet parking
in dynamic, uncertain environments. Unlike existing methods that rely solely on
instantaneous observations or static assumptions, we present an approach that
predicts future parking spot occupancy by explicitly distinguishing between
initially vacant and occupied spots, and by leveraging the predicted motion of
dynamic agents. We introduce a probabilistic spot occupancy estimator that
incorporates partial and noisy observations within a limited Field-of-View
(FoV) model and accounts for the evolving uncertainty of unobserved regions.
Coupled with this, we design a strategy planner that adaptively balances
goal-directed parking maneuvers with exploratory navigation based on
information gain, and intelligently incorporates wait-and-go behaviors at
promising spots. Through randomized simulations emulating large parking lots,
we demonstrate that our framework significantly improves parking efficiency,
safety margins, and trajectory smoothness compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Vision-based locomotion in outdoor environments presents significant
challenges for quadruped robots. Accurate environmental prediction and
effective handling of depth sensor noise during real-world deployment remain
difficult, severely restricting the outdoor applications of such algorithms. To
address these deployment challenges in vision-based motion control, this letter
proposes the Redundant Estimator Network (RENet) framework. The framework
employs a dual-estimator architecture that ensures robust motion performance
while maintaining deployment stability during onboard vision failures. Through
an online estimator adaptation, our method enables seamless transitions between
estimation modules when handling visual perception uncertainties. Experimental
validation on a real-world robot demonstrates the framework's effectiveness in
complex outdoor environments, showing particular advantages in scenarios with
degraded visual perception. This framework demonstrates its potential as a
practical solution for reliable robotic deployment in challenging field

TL;DR: OmniEVA是一个多模态大语言模型驱动的具身智能规划器，通过任务自适应3D接地机制和具身感知推理框架，解决了现有系统的几何适应性差距和具身约束差距问题，在多种下游场景中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于MLLM的具身系统存在两个关键局限：几何适应性差距（2D输入或硬编码3D几何注入导致空间信息不足或泛化受限）和具身约束差距（忽略真实机器人的物理约束，导致计划理论上有效但实际不可行）。

Method: 提出两个核心创新：1) 任务自适应3D接地机制 - 使用门控路由器根据上下文需求进行选择性3D融合调节；2) 具身感知推理框架 - 将任务目标和具身约束共同纳入推理循环，生成可执行的目标导向规划决策。

Conclusion: OmniEVA通过创新的3D接地和具身感知推理方法，有效解决了现有MLLM具身系统的关键局限性，为具身智能提供了更实用和适应性强的规划解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have opened new
opportunities for embodied intelligence, enabling multimodal understanding,
reasoning, and interaction, as well as continuous spatial decision-making.
Nevertheless, current MLLM-based embodied systems face two critical
limitations. First, Geometric Adaptability Gap: models trained solely on 2D
inputs or with hard-coded 3D geometry injection suffer from either insufficient
spatial information or restricted 2D generalization, leading to poor
adaptability across tasks with diverse spatial demands. Second, Embodiment
Constraint Gap: prior work often neglects the physical constraints and
capacities of real robots, resulting in task plans that are theoretically valid
but practically infeasible.To address these gaps, we introduce OmniEVA -- an
embodied versatile planner that enables advanced embodied reasoning and task
planning through two pivotal innovations: (1) a Task-Adaptive 3D Grounding
mechanism, which introduces a gated router to perform explicit selective
regulation of 3D fusion based on contextual requirements, enabling
context-aware 3D grounding for diverse embodied tasks. (2) an Embodiment-Aware
Reasoning framework that jointly incorporates task goals and embodiment
constraints into the reasoning loop, resulting in planning decisions that are
both goal-directed and executable. Extensive experimental results demonstrate
that OmniEVA not only achieves state-of-the-art general embodied reasoning
performance, but also exhibits a strong ability across a wide range of
downstream scenarios. Evaluations of a suite of proposed embodied benchmarks,
including both primitive and composite tasks, confirm its robust and versatile
planning capabilities. Project page: https://omnieva.github.io

Conclusion: VLA-Adapter显著降低了VLA模型的部署门槛，提供了一种高效、轻量级的视觉-语言-动作桥接解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models typically bridge the gap between
perceptual and action spaces by pre-training a large-scale Vision-Language
Model (VLM) on robotic data. While this approach greatly enhances performance,
it also incurs significant training costs. In this paper, we investigate how to
effectively bridge vision-language (VL) representations to action (A). We
introduce VLA-Adapter, a novel paradigm designed to reduce the reliance of VLA
models on large-scale VLMs and extensive pre-training. To this end, we first
systematically analyze the effectiveness of various VL conditions and present
key findings on which conditions are essential for bridging perception and
action spaces. Based on these insights, we propose a lightweight Policy module
with Bridge Attention, which autonomously injects the optimal condition into
the action space. In this way, our method achieves high performance using only
a 0.5B-parameter backbone, without any robotic data pre-training. Extensive
experiments on both simulated and real-world robotic benchmarks demonstrate
that VLA-Adapter not only achieves state-of-the-art level performance, but also
offers the fast inference speed reported to date. Furthermore, thanks to the
proposed advanced bridging paradigm, VLA-Adapter enables the training of a
powerful VLA model in just 8 hours on a single consumer-grade GPU, greatly
lowering the barrier to deploying the VLA model. Project page:

Abstract: Cable-driven continuum robots offer high flexibility and lightweight design,
making them well-suited for tasks in constrained and unstructured environments.
However, prolonged use can induce mechanical fatigue from plastic deformation
and material degradation, compromising performance and risking structural
failure. In the state of the art, fatigue estimation of continuum robots
remains underexplored, limiting long-term operation. To address this, we
propose a fatigue-aware continuum robot with three key innovations: (1) a
Hybrid Hinge-Beam structure where TwistBeam and BendBeam decouple torsion and
bending: passive revolute joints in the BendBeam mitigate stress concentration,
while TwistBeam's limited torsional deformation reduces BendBeam stress
magnitude, enhancing durability; (2) a Passive Stopper that safely constrains
motion via mechanical constraints and employs motor torque sensing to detect
corresponding limit torque, ensuring safety and enabling data collection; and
(3) a real-time fatigue-awareness method that estimates stiffness from motor
torque at the limit pose, enabling online fatigue estimation without additional
sensors. Experiments show that the proposed design reduces fatigue accumulation
by about 49% compared with a conventional design, while passive mechanical
limiting combined with motor-side sensing allows accurate estimation of
structural fatigue and damage. These results confirm the effectiveness of the
proposed architecture for safe and reliable long-term operation.

driven progress in these domains, they often suffer from limitations in sensing
modalities, environmental diversity, and the reproducibility of the underlying
hardware setups. To address these challenges, this paper introduces SMapper, a
novel open-hardware, multi-sensor platform designed explicitly for, though not
limited to, SLAM research. The device integrates synchronized LiDAR,
multi-camera, and inertial sensing, supported by a robust calibration and
synchronization pipeline that ensures precise spatio-temporal alignment across
modalities. Its open and replicable design allows researchers to extend its
capabilities and reproduce experiments across both handheld and robot-mounted
scenarios. To demonstrate its practicality, we additionally release
SMapper-light, a publicly available SLAM dataset containing representative
indoor and outdoor sequences. The dataset includes tightly synchronized
multimodal data and ground-truth trajectories derived from offline LiDAR-based
SLAM with sub-centimeter accuracy, alongside dense 3D reconstructions.
Furthermore, the paper contains benchmarking results on state-of-the-art LiDAR
and visual SLAM frameworks using the SMapper-light dataset. By combining
open-hardware design, reproducible data collection, and comprehensive
benchmarking, SMapper establishes a robust foundation for advancing SLAM
algorithm development, evaluation, and reproducibility.

Abstract: Detecting incipient slip enables early intervention to prevent object
slippage and enhance robotic manipulation safety. However, deploying such
systems on edge platforms remains challenging, particularly due to energy
constraints. This work presents a neuromorphic tactile sensing system based on
the NeuroTac sensor with an extruding papillae-based skin and a spiking
convolutional neural network (SCNN) for slip-state classification. The SCNN
model achieves 94.33% classification accuracy across three classes (no slip,
incipient slip, and gross slip) in slip conditions induced by sensor motion.
Under the dynamic gravity-induced slip validation conditions, after temporal
smoothing of the SCNN's final-layer spike counts, the system detects incipient
slip at least 360 ms prior to gross slip across all trials, consistently
identifying incipient slip before gross slip occurs. These results demonstrate
that this neuromorphic system has stable and responsive incipient slip
detection capability.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于对象的相对控制方法(Object-relative control)，通过构建相对3D场景图来实现更好的室内导航性能，充分利用对象表征的体验和路径不变性。


<details>

Motivation: 传统的基于图像相对控制方法(image-relative control)存在限制，图像与代理的位弊和体验绑定，而对象作为地图属性能够提供更好的体验和路径不变性表征。

Method: 提出了一种顶度地形地图表征形弊，即"相对"3D场景图，用于获取更信息丰富的对象级全局路径规划成本。训练了一个本地控制器ObjectReact，直接条件化高级"WayObject Costmap"表征，消除了显式RGB输入的需求。

Conclusion: 对象相对控制方法为单直摄像头和顶度地图的导航提供了一种新的范式，具有更好的体验不变性、路径不变性和跨体验部署能力，能够在不严格模仿之前经验的情况下遍历新路线。

Abstract: Visual navigation using only a single camera and a topological map has
recently become an appealing alternative to methods that require additional
sensors and 3D maps. This is typically achieved through an "image-relative"
approach to estimating control from a given pair of current observation and
subgoal image. However, image-level representations of the world have
limitations because images are strictly tied to the agent's pose and
embodiment. In contrast, objects, being a property of the map, offer an
embodiment- and trajectory-invariant world representation. In this work, we
present a new paradigm of learning "object-relative" control that exhibits
several desirable characteristics: a) new routes can be traversed without
strictly requiring to imitate prior experience, b) the control prediction
problem can be decoupled from solving the image matching problem, and c) high
invariance can be achieved in cross-embodiment deployment for variations across
both training-testing and mapping-execution settings. We propose a topometric
map representation in the form of a "relative" 3D scene graph, which is used to
obtain more informative object-level global path planning costs. We train a
local controller, dubbed "ObjectReact", conditioned directly on a high-level
"WayObject Costmap" representation that eliminates the need for an explicit RGB
input. We demonstrate the advantages of learning object-relative control over
its image-relative counterpart across sensor height variations and multiple
navigation tasks that challenge the underlying spatial understanding
capability, e.g., navigating a map trajectory in the reverse direction. We
further show that our sim-only policy is able to generalize well to real-world
indoor environments. Code and supplementary material are accessible via project

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有治疗和社交机器人主要模仿外观和关节运动，但忽视了生物体全身膨胀收缩这种体积变化运动对生命感感知的影响

Method: 开发MOFU机器人（采用Jitterbug结构实现单电机驱动的全身膨胀收缩），通过在线视频调查使用Godspeed问卷评估膨胀收缩运动对生命感感知的影响

Result: 1) 膨胀收缩显著增加感知生命感；2) 双机器人未比单机器人显著增加生命感；3) 膨胀收缩与运动结合比单独运动产生更高的生命感评分

Conclusion: 体积变化运动如膨胀收缩能增强机器人感知的生命感，应作为未来塑造人类印象的机器人设计的重要考虑因素

Abstract: Robots for therapy and social interaction are often intended to evoke
"animacy" in humans. While many robots imitate appearance and joint movements,
little attention has been given to whole-body expansion-contraction,
volume-changing movements observed in living organisms, and their effect on
animacy perception. We developed a mobile robot called "MOFU (Morphing Fluffy
Unit)," capable of whole-body expansion-contraction with a single motor and
covered with a fluffy exterior. MOFU employs a "Jitterbug" structure, a
geometric transformation mechanism that enables smooth volume change in
diameter from 210 to 280 mm using one actuator. It is also equipped with a
differential two-wheel drive mechanism for locomotion. To evaluate the effect
of expansion-contraction movements, we conducted an online survey using videos
of MOFU's behavior. Participants rated impressions with the Godspeed
Questionnaire Series. First, we compared videos of MOFU in a stationary state
with and without expansion-contraction and turning, finding that
expansion-contraction significantly increased perceived animacy. Second, we
hypothesized that presenting two MOFUs would increase animacy compared with a
single robot; however, this was not supported, as no significant difference
emerged. Exploratory analyses further compared four dual-robot motion
conditions. Third, when expansion-contraction was combined with locomotion,
animacy ratings were higher than locomotion alone. These results suggest that
volume-changing movements such as expansion and contraction enhance perceived
animacy in robots and should be considered an important design element in
future robot development aimed at shaping human impressions.

TL;DR: Dexplore是一个统一的单循环优化方法，直接从大规模手-物体运动捕捉数据中学习机器人控制策略，避免了传统三阶段流程的误差累积问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的手-物体运动捕捉数据存在精度问题和人-机器人手之间的本体差异，传统三阶段方法（重定向、跟踪、残差校正）会导致演示数据利用不足和误差累积。

Method: 采用统一的单循环优化，联合执行重定向和跟踪，将演示作为软指导而非绝对真值。从原始轨迹推导自适应空间范围，使用强化学习训练策略保持在范围内同时最小化控制努力并完成任务。

Result: 该方法保留了演示意图，使机器人特定策略得以涌现，提高了对噪声的鲁棒性，并能扩展到大规模演示语料库。最终将跟踪策略蒸馏为基于视觉的技能条件生成控制器。

Conclusion: Dexplore提供了一个原则性的桥梁，将不完美的演示转化为灵巧操作的有效训练信号，支持跨物体泛化和真实世界部署。

Abstract: Hand-object motion-capture (MoCap) repositories offer large-scale,
contact-rich demonstrations and hold promise for scaling dexterous robotic
manipulation. Yet demonstration inaccuracies and embodiment gaps between human
and robot hands limit the straightforward use of these data. Existing methods
adopt a three-stage workflow, including retargeting, tracking, and residual
correction, which often leaves demonstrations underused and compound errors
across stages. We introduce Dexplore, a unified single-loop optimization that
jointly performs retargeting and tracking to learn robot control policies
directly from MoCap at scale. Rather than treating demonstrations as ground
truth, we use them as soft guidance. From raw trajectories, we derive adaptive
spatial scopes, and train with reinforcement learning to keep the policy
in-scope while minimizing control effort and accomplishing the task. This
unified formulation preserves demonstration intent, enables robot-specific
strategies to emerge, improves robustness to noise, and scales to large
demonstration corpora. We distill the scaled tracking policy into a
vision-based, skill-conditioned generative controller that encodes diverse
manipulation skills in a rich latent representation, supporting generalization
across objects and real-world deployment. Taken together, these contributions
position Dexplore as a principled bridge that transforms imperfect
demonstrations into effective training signals for dexterous manipulation.

Conclusion: SimpleVLA-RL框架有效提升了VLA模型的性能，证明了强化学习在视觉-语言-动作模型中的巨大潜力，为机器人操作任务提供了更高效和通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently emerged as a powerful
paradigm for robotic manipulation. Despite substantial progress enabled by
large-scale pretraining and supervised fine-tuning (SFT), these models face two
fundamental challenges: (i) the scarcity and high cost of large-scale
human-operated robotic trajectories required for SFT scaling, and (ii) limited
generalization to tasks involving distribution shift. Recent breakthroughs in
Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) demonstrate that reinforcement learning (RL) can
dramatically enhance step-by-step reasoning capabilities, raising a natural
question: Can RL similarly improve the long-horizon step-by-step action
planning of VLA? In this work, we introduce SimpleVLA-RL, an efficient RL
framework tailored for VLA models. Building upon veRL, we introduce
VLA-specific trajectory sampling, scalable parallelization, multi-environment
rendering, and optimized loss computation. When applied to OpenVLA-OFT,
SimpleVLA-RL achieves SoTA performance on LIBERO and even outperforms $\pi_0$
on RoboTwin 1.0\&2.0 with the exploration-enhancing strategies we introduce.
SimpleVLA-RL not only reduces dependence on large-scale data and enables robust
generalization, but also remarkably surpasses SFT in real-world tasks.
Moreover, we identify a novel phenomenon ``pushcut'' during RL training,
wherein the policy discovers previously unseen patterns beyond those seen in
the previous training process. Github: https://github.com/PRIME-RL/SimpleVLA-RL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于反向运动视角和多场四面体框架的扫描体计算方法，通过固定物体并逆向追踪空间点，将复杂轨迹简化为可线性化的点运动，解决了传统方法在几何保真度和鲁棒性方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的扫描体计算方法要么显式跟踪表面（在复杂交互下存在鲁棒性问题），要么使用隐式表示（在几何保真度和优化难度之间权衡）。需要一种既能保持几何细节又能处理复杂运动交互的鲁棒方法。

Method: 采用反向运动视角：固定物体并逆向追踪空间点，将复杂轨迹简化为可线性化的点运动。引入多场四面体框架，每个元素维护多个距离场，在轨迹交叉处保持精细几何细节。

Result: 方法能够鲁棒地计算各种运动（包括平移和螺旋运动）的扫描体，在路径规划和碰撞检测等实际应用中表现出色，解决了单场方法在轨迹交叉处失效的问题。

Conclusion: 通过反向运动视角和多场表示的结合，该方法在保持几何细节的同时提供了鲁棒的扫描体计算能力，为图形学、机器人和制造领域的相关应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Swept volume computation, the determination of regions occupied by moving
objects, is essential in graphics, robotics, and manufacturing. Existing
approaches either explicitly track surfaces, suffering from robustness issues
under complex interactions, or employ implicit representations that trade off
geometric fidelity and face optimization difficulties. We propose a novel
inversion of motion perspective: rather than tracking object motion, we fix the
object and trace spatial points backward in time, reducing complex trajectories
to efficiently linearizable point motions. Based on this, we introduce a multi
field tetrahedral framework that maintains multiple distance fileds per
element, preserving fine geometric details at trajectory intersections where
single field methods fail. Our method robustly computes swept volumes for
diverse motions, including translations and screw motions, and enables
practical applications in path planning and collision detection.

Conclusion: 提出的基于Voronoi分解的新算法为参数曲面上的曲线偏移计算提供了一种高效精确的解决方案，并展示了多个实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Computing offsets of curves on parametric surfaces is a fundamental yet
challenging operation in computer aided design and manufacturing. Traditional
analytical approaches suffer from time-consuming geodesic distance queries and
complex self intersection handling, while discrete methods often struggle with
precision. In this paper, we propose a totally different algorithm paradigm.
Our key insight is that by representing the source curve as a sequence of line
segment primitives, the Voronoi decomposition constrained to the parametric
surface enables localized offset computation. Specifically, the offsetting
process can be efficiently traced by independently visiting the corresponding
Voronoi cells. To address the challenge of computing the Voronoi decomposition
on parametric surfaces, we introduce two key techniques. First, we employ
intrinsic triangulation in the parameter space to accurately capture geodesic
distances. Second, instead of directly computing the surface-constrained
Voronoi decomposition, we decompose the triangulated parameter plane using a
series of plane cutting operations. Experimental results demonstrate that our
algorithm achieves superior accuracy and runtime performance compared to
existing methods. We also present several practical applications enabled by our
approach.

Abstract: Harmonic decomposition of surfaces, such as spherical and spheroidal
harmonics, is used to analyze morphology, reconstruct, and generate surface
inclusions of particulate microstructures. However, obtaining high-quality
meshes of engineering microstructures using these approaches remains an open
question. In harmonic approaches, we usually reconstruct surfaces by evaluating
the harmonic bases on equidistantly sampled simplicial complexes of the base
domains (e.g., triangular spheroids and disks). However, this traditional
sampling does not account for local changes in the Jacobian of the basis
functions, resulting in nonuniform discretization after reconstruction or
generation. As it impacts the accuracy and time step, high-quality
discretization of microstructures is crucial for efficient numerical
simulations (e.g., finite element and discrete element methods). To circumvent
this issue, we propose an efficient hierarchical diffusion-based approach for
resampling the surface-i.e., performing a reparameterization-to yield an
equalized mesh triangulation. Analogous to heat problems, we use nonlinear
diffusion to resample the curvilinear coordinates of the analysis domain,
thereby enlarging small triangles at the expense of large triangles on
surfaces. We tested isotropic and anisotropic diffusion schemes on the recent
spheroidal and hemispheroidal harmonics methods. The results show a substantial
improvement in the quality metrics for surface triangulation. Unlike
traditional surface reconstruction and meshing techniques, this approach
preserves surface morphology, along with the areas and volumes of surfaces. We
discuss the results and the associated computational costs for large 2D and 3D
microstructures, such as digital twins of concrete and stone masonry, and their
future applications.

Abstract: Accurate measurement of images produced by electronic displays is critical
for the evaluation of both traditional and computational displays. Traditional
display measurement methods based on sparse radiometric sampling and fitting a
model are inadequate for capturing spatially varying display artifacts, as they
fail to capture high-frequency and pixel-level distortions. While cameras offer
sufficient spatial resolution, they introduce optical, sampling, and
photometric distortions. Furthermore, the physical measurement must be combined
with a model of a visual system to assess whether the distortions are going to
be visible. To enable perceptual assessment of displays, we propose a
combination of a camera-based reconstruction pipeline with a visual difference
predictor, which account for both the inaccuracy of camera measurements and
visual difference prediction. The reconstruction pipeline combines HDR image
stacking, MTF inversion, vignetting correction, geometric undistortion,
homography transformation, and color correction, enabling cameras to function
as precise display measurement instruments. By incorporating a Visual
Difference Predictor (VDP), our system models the visibility of various stimuli
under different viewing conditions for the human visual system. We validate the
proposed CameraVDP framework through three applications: defective pixel
detection, color fringing awareness, and display non-uniformity evaluation. Our
uncertainty analysis framework enables the estimation of the theoretical upper
bound for defect pixel detection performance and provides confidence intervals
for VDP quality scores.
